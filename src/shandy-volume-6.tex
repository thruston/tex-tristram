\dropcap{Y}{ou} \tight{see ’tis high time, said my father,}\break
\tighter{addressing himself equally to my un-}\break
\stick{cle \toby and \textit{Yorick}, to take this young} 
\stick{creature out of these women’s hands,}
\stick{and put him into those of a private go-}
\stick{vernor. \textit{Marcus Antoninus} provided four-}\catch{teen} 
\stick{teen governors all at once to superintend} 
\stick{his son \textit{Commodus}’s education,\tsk and in}
\stick{six weeks he cashiered five of them;\tsk} 
\stick{I know very well, continued my father,} 
\stick{that \textit{Commodus}’s mother was in love with} 
\stick{a gladiator at the time of her concep-}
\stick{tion, which accounts for a great many} 
\stick{of \textit{Commodus}’s cruelties when he became} 
\stick{emperor;\tsk but still I am of opinion,}
\stick{that those five whom \textit{Antoninus} dismiss-}
\stick{ed, did \textit{Commodus}’s temper in that short}
\stick{time, more hurt than the other nine} 
were able to rectify all their lives long.

Now as I consider the person who is\break
\stick{to be about my son, as the mirror in}
\stick{which he is to view himself from morn-}
\stick{ing to night, and by which he is to adjust} 
\stick{his looks, his carriage, and perhaps the}
\stick{inmost sentiments of his heart;\tsk I would}
\stick{have one, \textit{Yorick}, if possible, polished at}\catch{all} 
\stick{all points, fit for my child to look into.}
\stick{\tsh This is very good sense, quoth my}
uncle \toby to himself.

\tsh There is, continued my father,\break
\stick{a certain mien and motion of the body}
\stick{and all its parts, both in acting and}
\stick{speaking, which argues a man \textit{well}}
\stick{\textit{within}; and I am not at all surprized}
\stick{that \textit{Gregory} of \textit{Nazianzum}, upon ob-}
\stick{serving the hasty and untoward gestures}
\stick{of \textit{Julian}, should foretel he would one}
\stick{day become an apostate;\tsh or that St.}
\stick{\textit{Ambrose} should turn his \textit{Amanuensis} out}
\stick{of doors, because of an indecent mo-}
\stick{tion of his head, which went backwards}
\stick{and forwards like a flail;\tsh or that} 
\stick{\textit{Democritus} should conceive \textit{Protagoras}} 
\stick{to be a scholar, from seeing him bind up} 
\stick{a faggot, and thrusting, as he did it,}
\stick{the small twigs inwards.\tsh There are a}\catch{thou-}
\stick{thousand unnoticed openings, continued} 
\stick{my father, which let a penetrating eye} 
\stick{at once into a man’s soul; and I main-}
\stick{tain it, added he, that a man of sense} 
\stick{does not lay down his hat in coming} 
\stick{into a room,\tsk or take it up in going out} 
\stick{of it, but something escapes, which dis-}
covers him.

It is for these reasons, continued my\break
\stick{father, that the governor I make choice}
\stick{of shall neither \fnast\ lisp, or squint, or wink,}
\stick{or talk loud, or look fierce, or foolish;}
\stick{\tsh or bite his lips, or grind his teeth,}
\stick{or speak through his nose, or pick it,}
or blow it with his fingers.\tsh

He shall neither walk fast,\tsk or slow,\break

or hide them in his pocket, for that is\break
nonsense.\tsh

He shall neither strike, or pinch, or\break
\stick{tickle,\tsk or bite, or cut his nails, or}
\stick{hawk, or spit, or snift, or drum with his} 
\stick{feet or fingers in company;\tsh nor (ac-}

\centerline{\textit{The Story of} \textscl{Le Fever}.}

\dropcap{I}{t} was some time in the summer of\break
that year in which \textit{Dendermond} was\break
\stick{taken by the allies,\tsk which was about}
\stick{seven years before my father came into} 
\stick{the country,\tsk and about as many, after}
\stick{the time, that my uncle \toby and \trim} 
\stick{had privately decamped from my father’s}
\stick{house in town, in order to lay some of}
\stick{the finest sieges to some of the finest}
\stick{fortified cities in \textit{Europe}\tsh when my}
\stick{uncle \toby was one evening getting his}
\stick{supper, with \trim sitting behind him at}
\stick{a small sideboard,\tsk I say, sitting\tsk for}\catch{in} 
\stick{in consideration of the corporal’s lame}
\stick{knee (which sometimes gave him exqui-} 
\stick{site pain)\tsk when my uncle \toby dined or}
\stick{supped alone, he would never suffer the}
\stick{corporal to stand; and the poor fellow’s}
\stick{veneration for his master was such, that,}
\stick{with a proper artillery, my uncle \toby}
\stick{could have taken \textit{Dendermond} itself,} 
\stick{with less trouble than he was able to}
\stick{gain this point over him; for many a}
\stick{time when my uncle \toby supposed the}
\stick{corporal’s leg was at rest, he would look}
\stick{back, and detect him standing behind} 
\stick{him with the most dutiful respect: this} 
\stick{bred more little squabbles betwixt them,}
\stick{than all other causes for five and twenty}
\stick{years together\tsk But this is neither here}
\stick{nor there\tsk why do I mention it?\tsh}
\stick{Ask my pen,\tsk it governs me,\tsk I govern}
not it.\patch{He}

He was one evening sitting thus at\break
\stick{his supper, when the landlord of a little}
\stick{inn in the village came into the parlour}
\stick{with an empty phial in his hand, to beg}
\stick{a glass or two of sack; ’Tis for a poor}
\stick{gentleman,\tsk I think, of the army, said}
\stick{the landlord, who has been taken ill at}
\stick{my house four days ago, and has never}
\stick{held up his head since, or had a desire}
\stick{to taste any thing, till just now, that}
\stick{he has a fancy for a glass of sack and a}
\stick{thin toast,\tsh \textit{I~think}, says he, taking}
\stick{his hand from his forehead, \textit{it would}}
\textit{comfort me.}\tsh

\tsh If I could neither\sic\ beg, borrow,\break
\stick{or buy such a thing,\tsk added the land-}
\stick{lord,\tsk I~would almost steal it for the}
\stick{poor gentleman, he is so ill.\tsh I hope}
\stick{in God he will still mend, continued he,}
\tsk we are all of us concerned for him.\patch{Thou}

Thou art a good natured soul, I will\break
\stick{answer for thee, cried my uncle \toby;} 
\stick{and thou shalt drink the poor gentle-}
\stick{man’s health in a glass of sack thyself,}
\stick{\tsk and take a couple of bottles with my}
\stick{service, and tell him he is heartily wel-}
\stick{come to them, and to a dozen more if}
they will do him good.

Though I am persuaded, said my un-\break
\stick{cle \toby, as the landlord shut the door,}
\stick{he is a very compassionate fellow\tsk \trim,}
\stick{\tsk yet I cannot help entertaining a high} 
\stick{opinion of his guest too; there must be}
\stick{something more than common in him,}
\stick{that in so short a time should win so} 
\stick{much upon the affections of his host;}
\stick{\tsh And of his whole family, added} 
\stick{the corporal, for they are all concerned}
\stick{for him.\tsh Step after him, said my}\catch{uncle\enspace} 
\stick{uncle \toby,\tsk do \trim,\tsk and ask if he} 
knows his name.

\tsh I have quite forgot it, truly,\break
\stick{said the landlord, coming back into the}
\stick{parlour with the corporal,\tsk but I can}
\stick{ask his son again:\tsh Has he a son with}
\stick{him then? said my uncle \toby.\tsk A boy,}
\stick{replied the landlord, of about eleven or}
\stick{twelve years of age;\tsk but the poor crea-}
\stick{ture has tasted almost as little as his fa-}
\stick{ther; he does nothing but mourn and}
\stick{lament for him night and day:\tsh He}
\stick{has not stirred from the bedside these}
two days.

My uncle \toby laid down his knife\break
\stick{and fork, and thrust his plate from be-}
\stick{fore him, as the landlord gave him the} 
\stick{account; and \trim, without being or-}
\stick{dered, took away without saying one}\catch{word,}
\stick{word, and in a few minutes after brought}
him his pipe and tobacco.

\tsh Stay in the room a little, said\break
my uncle \toby.\tsh

\textit{Trim!}\tsh said my uncle \toby, after\break
\stick{he lighted his pipe, and smoak’d about}
\stick{a dozen whiffs.\tsh \trim came in front}
\stick{of his master, and made his bow;\tsk my}
\stick{uncle \toby smoak’d on, and said no}
\stick{more.\tsh Corporal! said my uncle \toby}
\stick{\tsh the corporal made his bow.\tsh}
\stick{My uncle \toby proceeded no farther, but} 
finished his pipe.

\textit{Trim!} said my uncle \toby, I have a\break
\stick{project in my head, as it is a bad night,}
\stick{of wrapping myself up warm in my ro-}
\stick{quelaure, and paying a visit to this poor}
\stick{gentleman.\tsh Your honour’s roque-}\catch{laure,} 
\stick{laure, replied the corporal, has not} 
\stick{once been had on, since the night before}
\stick{your honour received your wound, when}
\stick{we mounted guard in the trenches be-}
\stick{fore the gate of St.\@ \textit{Nicholas};\tsk and}
\stick{besides it is so cold and rainy a night,}
\stick{that what with the roquelaure, and what}
\stick{with the weather, ’twill be enough to}

\stick{I fear so; replied my uncle \toby, but I}

\stick{the account the landlord has given me.}
\stick{\tsh I wish I had not known so much of} 
\stick{this affair,\tsk added my uncle \toby,\tsk or}
\stick{that I had known more of it:\tsh How} 
\stick{shall we manage it?  Leave it, an’t}

\stick{\toby, and here’s a shilling for thee to} 
\stick{drink with his servant.\tsh I shall get it} 
\stick{all out of him, said the corporal, shut-}
ting the door.

My uncle \toby filled his second pipe;\break
\stick{and had it not been, that he now and} 
\stick{then wandered from the point, with}
\stick{considering whether it was not full as} 
\stick{well to have the curtain of the tennaile}

\centerline{\textit{The Story of} \textscl{Le Fever} \textit{continued}.}

\dropcap{I}{t} was not till my uncle \toby had\break
knocked the ashes out of his third\break
\stick{pipe, that corporal \trim returned from} 
\stick{the inn, and gave him the following}
account.

I despaired at first, said the corporal,\break
\stick{of being able to bring back your honour}
\stick{any kind of intelligence concerning the}
\stick{poor sick lieutenant\tsk Is he in the army}
\stick{then?  said my uncle \textit{Toby}\tsh He is:}
\stick{said the corporal\tsh And in what re-}
\stick{giment?  said my uncle \textit{Toby}\tsh I’ll tell}
\stick{your honour, replied the corporal, every}
\stick{thing straight forwards, as I learnt it.\tsk}
\stick{Then, \trim, I’ll fill another pipe, said}
\stick{my uncle \toby, and not interrupt thee}\catch{till} 
\stick{till thou hast done; so sit down at thy}
\stick{ease, \trim, in the window seat, and be-}
\stick{gin thy story again.  The corporal made}
\stick{his old bow, which generally spoke as} 
\stick{plain as a bow could speak it\tsk \textit{Your}}
\stick{\textit{honour is good:}\tsk And having done}
\stick{that, he sat down, as he was ordered,\tsk}
\stick{and begun the story to my uncle \toby} 
\stick{over again in pretty near the same}
words.

I despaired at first, said the corporal,\break
\stick{of being able to bring back any intelli-}
\stick{gence to your honour, about the lieute-}
\stick{nant and his son; for when I asked}
\stick{where his servant was, from whom I} 
\stick{made myself sure of knowing every}
\stick{thing which was proper to be asked,\tsk}
\stick{That’s a right distinction, \trim, said my} 
\stick{uncle \textit{Toby}\tsk I was answered, an’ please} 
\stick{your honour, that he had no servant}\catch{with} 
\stick{with him;\tsh that he had come to the}
\stick{inn with hired horses, which, upon}
\stick{finding himself unable to proceed, (to}
\stick{join, I suppose, the regiment) he had}
\stick{dismissed the morning after he came.\tsk}
\stick{If I get better, my dear, said he, as he}
\stick{gave his purse to his son to pay the man,}
\stick{\tsk we can hire horses from hence.\tsh}
\stick{But alas! the poor gentleman will never}
\stick{get from hence, said the landlady to me,}
\stick{\tsk for I heard the death-watch all night}
\stick{long;\tsh and when he dies, the youth,}
\stick{his son, will certainly die with him;}
for he is broken-hearted already.

I was hearing this account, continued\break
\stick{the corporal, when the youth came into}
\stick{the kitchen, to order the thin toast the}
\stick{landlord spoke of;\tsh but I will do it}
\stick{for my father myself, said the youth.}
\stick{\tsh Pray let my save you the trouble,}\catch{young}
\stick{young gentleman, said I, taking up a}
\stick{fork for the purpose, and offering him}
\stick{my chair to sit down upon by the fire,}
\stick{whilst I did it.\tsh I believe, Sir, said he,}
\stick{very modestly, I can please him best}
\stick{myself.\tsh I am sure, said I, his honour}
\stick{will not like the toast the worse for being}
\stick{toasted by an old soldier.\tsh The youth}
\stick{took hold of my hand, and instantly}
\stick{burst into tears.\tsk Poor youth! said}
\stick{my uncle \toby,\tsk he has been bred up}
\stick{from an infant in the army, and the}
\stick{name of a soldier, \trim, sounded in his}
\stick{ears like the name of a friend;\tsk I wish}
I had him here.

\tsh I never, in the longest march,\break
\stick{said the corporal, had so great a mind to}
\stick{my dinner, as I had to cry with him} 
\stick{for company:\tsk What could be the mat-}
\stick{ter with me, an’ please your honour?}\catch{Nothing} 
\stick{Nothing in the world, \trim, said my}
\stick{uncle \toby, blowing his nose,\tsk but that} 
thou art a good natured fellow.

When I gave him the toast, continued\break
\stick{the corporal, I thought it was proper to}
\stick{tell him I was Captain \textit{Shandy}’s servant,}
\stick{and that your honour (though a stran-} 
\stick{ger) was extremely concerned for his}
\stick{father;\tsk and that if there was any thing}
\stick{in your house or cellar\tsh (And thou}
\stick{might’st have added my purse too, said}
\stick{my uncle \toby)\tsh he was heartily wel-}
\stick{come to it:\tsh He made a very low} 
\stick{bow, (which was meant to your honour)} 
\stick{but no answer,\tsk for his heart was full\tsk} 
\stick{so he went up stairs with the toast;\tsk I}
\stick{warrant you, my dear, said I, as I open-}
\stick{ed the kitchen door, your father will be}
\stick{well again.\tsh Mr.\@ \textit{Yorick}’s curate was}\catch{smoak-} 
\stick{smoaking a pipe by the kitchen fire,\tsk} 
\stick{but said not a word good or bad to com-}
\stick{fort the youth.\tsh I thought it wrong;} 
\stick{added the corporal\tsh I think so too,} 
said my uncle \textit{Toby.}

When the lieutenant had taken his\break
\stick{glass of sack and toast, he felt himself}
\stick{a little revived, and sent down into the}
\stick{kitchen, to let me know, that in about}
\stick{ten minutes he should be glad if I}
\stick{would step up stairs.\tsh I believe, said}
\stick{the landlord, he is going to say his}
\stick{prayers,\tsh for there was a book laid} 
\stick{upon the chair by his bedside, and as I} 
\stick{shut the door, I saw his son take up a}
cushion.\tsh

I thought, said the curate, that you\break
\stick{gentlemen of the army, Mr.\@ \trim, never}
\stick{said your prayers at all.\tsh I heard the}\catch{poor}
\stick{poor gentleman say his prayers last}
\stick{night, said the landlady, very devoutly,}
\stick{and with my own ears, or I could not} 
\stick{have believed it.\tsh Are you sure of it?} 
\stick{replied the curate.\tsh A soldier, an’}
\stick{please your reverence, said I, prays as} 
\stick{often (of his own accord) as a parson;}
\stick{\tsh and when he is fighting for his} 
\stick{king, and for his own life, and for his}
\stick{honour too, he has the most reason to}
\stick{pray to God, of any one in the whole}
\stick{world\tsh ’Twas well said of thee, \trim,}
\stick{said my uncle \textit{Toby.}\tsh But when a sol-}
\stick{dier, said I, an’ please your reverence,}
\stick{has been standing for twelve hours toge-}
\stick{ther in the trenches, up to his knees in}
\stick{cold water,\tsk or engaged, said I, for}
\stick{months together in long and dangerous}
\stick{marches;\tsk harassed, perhaps, in his}
\stick{rear to-day;\tsk harassing others to-mor-}
\stick{row;\tsk detached here;\tsk countermanded}\catch{there;}
\stick{there;\tsk resting this night out upon his}
\stick{arms;\tsk beat up in his shirt the next;\tsk} 
\stick{benumbed in his joints;\tsk perhaps with-}
\stick{out straw in his tent to kneel on;\tsk must}
\stick{say his prayers \textit{how} and \textit{when} he can.\tsk}
\stick{I believe, said I,\tsk for I was piqued,}
\stick{quoth the corporal, for the reputation} 
\stick{of the army,\tsk I believe, an’ please your}
\stick{reverence, said I, that when a soldier} 
\stick{gets time to pray,\tsk he prays as heartily} 
\stick{as a parson,\tsk though not with all his} 
\stick{fuss and hypocrisy.\tsh Thou shouldst} 
\stick{not have said that, \trim, said my uncle} 
\stick{\toby,\tsk for God only knows who is a hy-}
\stick{pocrite, and who is not:\tsh At the} 
\stick{great and general review of us all, cor-}
\stick{poral, at the day of judgment, (and} 
\stick{not till then)\tsk it will be seen who has} 
\stick{done their duties in this world,\tsk and} 
\stick{who has not; and we shall be advanced,} 
\stick{\trim, accordingly.\tsh I hope we shall,}\catch{said}
\stick{said \textit{Trim.}\tsh It is in the Scripture, said}
\stick{my uncle \toby; and I will shew it thee}
\stick{to-morrow:\tsk In the mean time we}
\stick{may depend upon it, \trim, for our} 
\stick{comfort, said my uncle \toby, that God}
\stick{Almighty is so good and just a gover-}
\stick{nor of the world, that if we have but} 
\stick{done our duties in it,\tsk it will never be}
\stick{enquired into, whether we have done} 
\stick{them in a red coat or a black one:\tsk}
\stick{I hope not; said the corporal\tsk But}
\stick{go on, \trim, said my uncle \toby, with}
thy story.

When I went up, continued the cor-\break
\stick{poral, into the lieutenant’s room, which} 
\stick{I did not do till the expiration of the} 
\stick{ten minutes,\tsk he was lying in his bed} 
\stick{with his head raised upon his hand,} 
\stick{with his elbow upon the pillow, and a}
\stick{clean white cambrick handkerchief be-}\catch{side}
\stick{side it:\tsh The youth was just stooping}
\stick{down to take up the cushion, upon} 
\stick{which I supposed he had been kneeling,}
\stick{\tsk the book was laid upon the bed,\tsk}
\stick{and as he rose, in taking up the cushion}
\stick{with one hand, he reached out his other}
\stick{to take it away at the same time.\tsh}
\stick{Let it remain there, my dear, said the} 
lieutenant.

He did not offer to speak to me, till\break
\stick{I had walked up close to his bed-side:\tsk}
\stick{If you are captain \textit{Shandy}’s servant, said} 
\stick{he, you must present my thanks to your}
\stick{master, with my little boy’s thanks} 
\stick{along with them, for his courtesy to}
\stick{me;\tsk if he was of \textit{Levens}’s\tsk said the}
\stick{lieutenant.\tsk I told him your honour}
\stick{was\tsk Then, said he, I served three cam-}
\stick{paigns with him in \textit{Flanders}, and re-}
\stick{member him,\tsk but ’tis most likely, as}\catch{I had}
\stick{I had not the honour of any acquaint-}
\stick{ance with him, that he knows nothing} 
\stick{of me.\tsh You will tell him, however,}
\stick{that the person his good nature has laid}
\stick{under obligations to him, is one \textit{Le}}
\stick{\textit{Fever}, a lieutenant in \textit{Angus}’s\tsk but}
\stick{he knows me not,\tsk said he, a second}
\stick{time, musing;\tsk possibly he may}
\stick{my story\tsk added he\tsk pray tell the cap-}
\stick{tain, I was the ensign at \textit{Breda}, whose} 
\stick{wife was most unfortunately killed with}
\stick{a musket shot, as she lay in my arms in} 
\stick{my tent.\tsh I remember the story, an’t} 
\stick{please your honour, said I, very well.}
\stick{\tsh Do you so? said he, wiping his} 
\stick{eyes with his handkerchief,\tsk then well}
\stick{may I.\tsk In saying this, he drew a little}
\stick{ring out of his bosom, which seemed}
\stick{tied with a black ribband about his neck,} 
\stick{and kiss’d it twice\tsh Here, \textit{Billy}, said}
\stick{he,\tsk the boy flew across the room to}\catch{the}
\stick{the bed-side,\tsk and falling down upon}
\stick{his knee, took the ring in his hand, and}
\stick{kissed it too,\tsk then kissed his father,}
and sat down upon the bed and wept.

I wish, said my uncle \toby, with a\break
deep sigh,\tsk I wish, \trim, I was asleep.

Your honour, replied the corporal,\break
\stick{is too much concerned;\tsk shall I pour}
\stick{your honour out a glass of sack to your} 
\stick{pipe?\tsh Do, \trim, said my uncle}
\textit{Toby.}

I remember, said my uncle \toby,\break
\stick{sighing again, the story of the ensign} 
\stick{and his wife, with a circumstance his}
\stick{modesty omitted;\tsk and particularly well}
\stick{that he, as well as she, upon some ac-}
\stick{count or other, (I forget what) was uni-}
\stick{versally pitied by the whole regiment;}\catch{\tsk but} 
\stick{\tsk but finish the story thou art upon:}
\stick{\tsk ’Tis finished already, said the corpo-}
\stick{ral,\tsk for I could stay no longer,\tsk so}
\stick{wished his honour a good night; young}
\stick{\textit{Le Fever} rose from off the bed, and saw} 
\stick{me to the bottom of the stairs; and as}
\stick{we went down together, told me, they} 
\stick{had come from \textit{Ireland}, and were on}
\stick{their route to join the regiment in \textit{Flan}-}
\stick{\textit{ders}.\tsh But alas! said the corporal,\tsk}
\stick{the lieutenant’s last day’s march is over.}  
\stick{\tsk Then what is to become of his poor}
boy? cried my uncle \textit{Toby.}

\stick{thee in what, \textit{Trim.}\tsh In the first}

\initial{I}{Am} so impatient to return to my own\break
story, that what remains of young\break
\stick{\textit{Le Fever}’s, that is, from this turn} 
\stick{of his fortune, to the time my uncle \textit{Toby}}
\stick{recommended him for my preceptor,} 
\stick{shall be told in a very few words in the}
\stick{next chapter.\tsk All that is necessary to} 
be added to this chapter is as follows.\tsk 

That my uncle \toby, with young \textit{Le}\break
\stick{\textit{Fever} in his hand, attended the poor}
\stick{lieutenant, as chief mourners, to his}
grave.\patch{That}

\indent\vrule width 0pt height 18pt
That the governor of \textit{Dendermond} paid\break
\stick{his obsequies all military honours,\tsk and} 
\stick{that \textit{Yorick}, not to be behind-hand\tsk}
\stick{paid him all ecclesiastic\tsk for he buried}
\stick{him in his chancel:\tsk And it appears}
\stick{likewise, he preached a funeral sermon} 
\stick{over him\tsh I say it \textit{appears},\tsk for it}
\stick{was \textit{Yorick}’s custom, which I suppose a} 
\stick{general one with those of his profession,} 
\stick{on the first leaf of every sermon which}
\stick{he composed, to chronicle down the}
\stick{time, the place, and the occasion of its}
\stick{being preached: to this, he was ever} 
\stick{wont to add some short comment or}
\stick{stricture upon the sermon itself, seldom,}
\stick{indeed, much to its credit:\tsk For in-} 
\stick{stance, \textit{This sermon upon the jewish dispen}-}
\stick{\textit{sation\tsk I don’t like it at all};\tsk \textit{Though I}}
\stick{\textit{own there is a world of} \textscl{water-landish}} 
\stick{\textit{knowlege\sic in it},\tsk \textit{but ’tis all tritical}, \textit{and}}\catch{\textit{most}}
\stick{\textit{most tritically put together.\tsh This is}}
\stick{\textit{but a flimsy kind of a composition}; \textit{what}}
\textit{was in my head when I made it?}

\tsk N.\@ B.\@ \textit{The excellency of this text\break 
is, that it will suit any sermon,\tsk and of\break 
this sermon,\tsk that it will suit any\break
text}.\tsh

\tsh \textit{For this sermon I shall be hanged,\break
\tsk for I have stolen the greatest part of it.\break
Doctor} Paidagunes \textit{found me out.\hfill \fist  Set\break
a  thief to catch a thief}.\tsh

On the back of half a dozen I find\break
\stick{written, \textit{So}, \textit{so}, and no more\tsh and} 
\stick{upon a couple \textit{Moderato}; by which, as} 
\stick{far as one may gather from \textit{Altieri’s Ita}-}
\stick{\textit{lian} dictionary,\tsk but mostly from the}
\stick{authority of a piece of green whipcord,}
\stick{which seemed to have been the unravel-}\catch{ling} 
\stick{ling of \textit{Yorick}’s whip-lash, with which} 
\stick{he has left us the two sermons marked}
\stick{\textit{Moderato}, and the half dozen of \textit{So}, \textit{so},} 
\stick{tied fast together in one bundle by them-}
\stck{selves,\tsk one may safely suppose he meant}
pretty near the same thing.

There is but one difficulty in the way\break

\stick{(and, to rise properly in my climax)\tsk} 
\stick{discover a thousand times more genius;}
\stick{\tsk and to crown all, are infinitely more}
\stck{entertaining than those tied up with them;}
\stick{\tsk for which reason, whene’er \textit{Yorick}’s}
\stck{\textit{dramatic} sermons are offered to the world,} 
\stick{though I shall admit but one out of the} 
\stick{whole number of the \textit{so}, \textit{so}’s, I shall,}\catch{never-}
\stick{nevertheless, adventure to print the two}
\textit{moderato}’s without any sort of scruple.

What \textit{Yorick} could mean by the words\break
\stick{\textit{lentamente},\tsk \textit{tenutè},\tsk \textit{grave},\tsk and some-} 
\stick{times \textit{adagio},\tsk as applied to \textit{theological}}
\stick{compositions, and with which he has} 
\stick{characterized some of these sermons, I} 
\stick{dare not venture to guess.\tsh I am more}
\stick{puzzled still upon finding \textit{a l’octava alta!}}
\stick{upon one;\tsh \textit{Con strepito} upon the back}
\stick{of another;\tsh \textit{Scicilliana} upon a third;}
\stick{\tsk \textit{Alla capella} upon a fourth;\tsk}
\stick{\textit{Con l’arco} upon this;\tsk \textit{Senza l’arco}}
\stick{upon that.\tsh All I know is, that they}
\stick{are musical terms, and have a mean-}
\stick{ing;\tsh and as he was a musical man,}
\stick{I will make no doubt, but that by some}
\stick{quaint application of such metaphors to}
\stick{the compositions in hand, they impressed}
\stick{very distinct ideas of their several cha-}\catch{racters} 
\stick{racters upon his fancy,\tsk whatever they}
may do upon that of others.

Amongst these, there is that particular\break
\stick{sermon which has unaccountably led me}
\stick{into this digression\tsh The funeral ser-}
\stick{mon upon poor \textit{Le Fever}, wrote out}
\stick{very fairly, as if from a hasty copy.\tsk I} 
\stick{take notice of it the more, because it}
\stick{seems to have been his favourite compo-}
\stick{sition\tsh It is upon mortality; and is}
\stick{tied length-ways and cross-ways with a}
\stick{yarn thrum, and then rolled up and}
\stick{twisted round with a half sheet of dirty}
\stick{blue paper, which seems to have been} 
\stick{once the cast cover of a general review,}
\stick{which to this day smells horribly of}
\stick{horse-drugs.\tsh Whether these marks}
\stick{of humiliation were designed,\tsk I some-}
\stick{thing doubt;\tsh because at the end of}
\stick{the sermon, (and not at the beginning}\catch{of}
\stick{of it)\tsk very different from his way of}
\stick{treating the rest, he had wrote\tsk\qquad}
\stick{\hfill Bravo! \hfill}
\stick{\indent\tsk Though not very offensively,}
\stick{\tsk for it is at two inches, at least,}
\stick{and a half’s distance from, and below} 
\stick{the concluding line of the sermon, at}
\stick{the very extremity of the page, and in}
\stick{that right hand corner of it, which, you}
\stick{know, is generally covered with your}
\stick{thumb; and, to do it justice, it is wrote}
\stick{besides with a crow’s quill so faintly in a} 
\stick{small \textit{Italian} hand, as scarce to sollicit} 
\stick{the eye towards the place, whether your}
\stick{thumb is there or not,\tsk so that from the} 
\stick{\textit{manner of it}, it stands half excused;} 
\stick{and being wrote moreover with very pale}
\stick{ink, diluted almost to nothing,\tsk ’tis}
\stick{more like a \textit{ritratto} of the shadow of va-}
\stick{nity, than of \textscl{Vanity} herself\tsk of the} 
\stick{two; resembling rather a faint thought}\catch{of}
\stick{of transient applause, secretly stirring}
\stick{up in the heart of the composer, than a}
\stick{gross mark of it, coarsely obtruded}
upon the world.

With all these extenuations, I am\break
\stick{aware, that in publishing this, I do no}
\stick{service to \textit{Yorick}’s character as a modest}
\stick{man;\tsk but all men have their failings!}
\stick{and what lessens this still farther, and}
\stick{almost wipes it away, is this; that the}
\stick{word was struck through sometime af-}
\stick{terwards (as appears from a different}
\stick{tint of the ink) with a line quite across} 
\stick{it in this manner, \hbox to
34pt{\rlap{\,BRAVO}\leaders\hrule width
1pt height 3.4pt depth -3.1pt\hfill}\tsk as if}
\stick{he had retracted, or was ashamed of the} 
opinion he had once entertained of it.

These short characters of his sermons\break 
\stick{were always written, excepting in this}
\stick{one instance, upon the first leaf of his}\catch{sermon,}
\stick{sermon, which served as a cover to it;}
\stick{and usually upon the inside of it, which}
\stick{was turned towards the text;\tsk but at}
\stick{the end of his discourse, where, perhaps,}
\stick{he had five or six pages, and sometimes,}
\stick{perhaps, a whole score to turn himself}
\stick{in,\tsk he took a large circuit, and, in-}
\stick{deed, a much more mettlesome one;\tsk}
\stick{as if he had snatched the occasion of un-}
\stick{lacing himself with a few more frolick-}
\stick{some strokes at vice, than the straitness}
\stick{of the pulpit allowed.\tsk These, though}
\stick{hussar-like, they skirmish lightly and}
\stick{out of all order, are still auxiliaries on the}

\dropcap{W}{hen} my uncle \toby had turned
every thing into money, and\break settled all accounts betwixt the agent
of the regiment and \textit{Le Fever}, and betwixt \textit{Le Fever}
and all mankind,\tsh\break
there remained nothing more in my uncle \toby's hands, than an old
regimental coat and a sword; so that my uncle \toby found little or no
opposition from the world in taking administration. The coat my uncle \textit{Toby}
gave the corporal;\break
\tsh Wear it, \trim, said my uncle \toby, as long
as it will hold together, for the sake of the poor lieutenant\tsh And this,\tsh said
my uncle \toby, taking up the sword in his hand, and drawing it out of the
scabbard as he spoke\tsk and\break this, \textit{Le Fever}, I’ll save for thee,\tsk
’tis\catch{all} all the fortune, continued my uncle \toby, hanging it up upon a
crook, and pointing to it,\tsk ’tis all the fortune, my dear \textit{Le Fever},
which God has left thee;\break
but if he has given thee a heart to fight thy way with it
in the world,\tsk and thou doest it like a man of honour,\tsk ’tis enough for us.

As soon as my uncle \toby had laid a foundation, and
taught him to inscribe a regular polygon in a circle, he sent him
to a public school, where, excepting \textit{Whitsontide} and
\textit{Christmas}, at which times the corporal was punctually
dispatched for him,\tsk he remained to the spring of the year,
seventeen; when the stories of the emperor’s sending his army
into \textit{Hungary} against the \textit{Turks}, kindling a spark of
fire in his bosom, he left his \textit{Greek} and \textit{Latin}
without leave, and\catch{throw-} throwing himself upon his knees before my uncle
\toby, begged his father’s sword, and my uncle
\toby's leave along with it, to go and try his fortune
under \textit{Eugene.}\tsk Twice did my uncle \toby forget
his wound and cry out, \textit{Le Fever!} I will go with thee, and
thou shalt fight beside me\tsh And twice he laid his hand
upon his groin, and hung down his head in sorrow and
disconsolation.\tsh

My uncle \toby took down the sword from the
crook, where it had hung untouched ever since the
lieutenant’s death, and delivered it to the corporal to
brighten up;\tsh and having detained \textit{Le Fever} a
single fortnight to equip him, and contract for his passage to
\textit{Leghorn},\break\tsk he put the sword into his
hand,\tsh If thou art brave, \textit{Le Fever}, said my
uncle \toby, this will not fail thee,\tsh\catch{but} but
Fortune, said he, (musing a little),\break\tsh Fortune
may\tsh And if she does,\break\tsk added my uncle \toby,
embracing him, come back again to me, \textit{Le Fever}, and we will
shape thee another course.

The greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of \textit{Le
Fever} more than my uncle \toby's paternal
kindness;\tsh he parted from my uncle \toby, as the
best of sons from the best of fathers\tsh\break both dropped
tears\tsh and as my uncle \toby gave him his last
kiss, he slipped sixty guineas, tied up in an old purse of his
father’s, in which was his mother’s ring, into his

Imperial army just time enough to try what metal his sword was made
of, at the defeat\break of the \textit{Turks} before \textit{Belgrade}; but a
series of unmerited mischances had pursued him from that moment,
and trod close upon his heels for four years together after; he had
withstood these buffetings to the last, till sickness overtook him
at \textit{Marseilles}, from whence he wrote my uncle \textit{Toby}

the first ship to return back to him.

\tsh till the character, by \textit{Yorick}’s inter-\break
position, ending unexpectedly, in one,
who should be gentle tempered, and ge\-nerous, and good, it impressed

Could the world have been sued like a

foul of individuals about it\tsh as every soul who had
mentioned the affair, did it with the greatest pity
imaginable;\tsh\break ’twas like flying in the very face

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XVI.}

\dropcap{T}{here} are a thousand resolutions,\break
Sir, both in church and state, as well as in matters, Madam, of a
more private concern;\tsk which, though they have carried all the
appearance in the world of being taken, and entered upon in a
hasty, hare-brained, and unadvised manner, were, notwithstanding
this,\catch{(and}
\stick{(and could you or I have got into the}

\stick{ed, poized, and perpended\tsh argued}

examined on all sides with so much coolness, that the
\textsc{goddess of coolness} herself (I do not take upon me
to prove her existence) could neither have wished it, or done it
better.

Of the number of these was my father’s resolution of
putting me into breeches; which, though determined\break
at once,\tsk in a kind of huff, and a defi\-ance of all mankind, had,
nevertheless,\break
been \textit{pro’d} and \textit{conn’d}, and
judicially talked over betwixt him and my mother about a month
before, in two several \textit{beds of justice}, which my father had
held for that purpose. I shall explain the\catch{nature} nature of these beds of
justice in my next chapter; and in the chapter following that, you
shall step with me, Madam, behind the curtain, only to hear in what
kind of manner my father and my mother debated between themselves,
this affair of the breeches,\tsk from which you may form an idea,
how they debated all lesser matters.

\smallskip

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XVII.}

\dropcap{T}{he} ancient \textit{Goths} of
\textit{Germany}, who (the learned \textit{Cluverius} is positive) were
first seated in the country between the \textit{Vistula} and the
\textit{Oder}, and who afterwards incorporated the \textit{Herculi}, the
\textit{Bugians}, and some other \textit{Vandallick} clans to
’em\tsk had all of them a wise custom of debating every
thing of importance\catch{to} to their state, twice, that is,\tsk once
drunk, and once sober:\tsh Drunk\tsk that their councils
might not want vigour;\tsh and sober\tsk that they might
not want discretion.

Now my father being entirely a water-drinker,\tsk was a long
time gravelled\break almost to death, in turning this as much to his
advantage, as he did every other thing which the ancients did or
said; and it was not till the seventh year of his marriage, after a
thousand fruitless experiments and devices, that he hit upon an
expedient which answered the purpose;\tsh and that was,
when any difficult and momentous point was to be settled in the
family, which required great sobriety, and great spirit too, in its
determination,\tsh he fixed and set apart the first
\textit{Sunday} night in the month, and\catch{the}
the \textit{Saturday} night which immediately
preceded it, to argue it over, in bed\break
with my mother: By which contrivance,\break
\stick{if you consider, Sir, with yourself, \astfill}
\stick{\astfill}
\stick{\astfill}
\stick{\astfill}
\hbox to 80pt{\astfill}.

These my father, humorously enough, called his \textit{beds of
justice};\tsh for from the two different counsels taken
in these two different humours, a middle one was generally found
out which touched the point of wisdom as well, as if he had got
drunk and sober a hundred times.

I must not be made a secret of to the world, that this answers
full as well in literary discussions, as either in military\catch{or} or
conjugal; but it is not every author that can try the experiment as
the \textit{Goths} and \textit{Vandals} did it\tsh or, if he
can, may it be always for his body’s health;\break and to do it, as
my father did it,\tsk\break am I sure it would be always for his
soul’s.

My way is this:\tsh

In all nice and ticklish discussions,\tsk (of which, heaven
knows, there are but too many in my book)\tsk where I find I
cannot take a step without the danger of having either their
worships or their reverences upon my back\tsh\break
I write one half \textit{full},\tsk and t’other
\textit{fasting};\tsh or write it all full,\tsk and
correct it fasting;\tsh or write it fasting,\tsk and
correct it full, for they all come to the same
thing:\tsh So that with a less\catch{variation} variation from my
father’s plan, than my father’s from the
\textit{Gothick}\tsk I feel myself upon a par with him in his first
bed of justice,\tsk and no way inferior to him in his
second.\tsh These different and almost irreconcileable
effects, flow uniformly from the wise and wonderful mechanism of
nature,\tsk of which,\tsk be her’s the
honour.\tsh All that we can do, is to turn and work the
machine to the improvement and better manufactory of the arts and
sciences.\tsh

Now, when I write full,\tsk I write as if I was never to write
fasting again as long as I live;\tsh that is, I write free
from the cares as well as the terrors of the
world.\tsh I count not the number of my scars,\tsk nor
does my fancy go forth into dark entries and bye corners to
ante-date my stabs.\tsh In a word, my pen\catch{takes} takes its
course; and I write on as much from the fullness of my heart, as my\break
stomach.\tsh

But when, an’ please your honours,\break I indite fasting, ’tis
a different history.\break\tsh I pay the world all possible
attention and respect,\tsk and have as great a share (whilst it
lasts) of that understrap\-ping virtue of discretion, as the best
of you.\tsh So that betwixt both, I write a careless kind of a
civil, nonsensical, good humoured \textit{Shandean} book, which
will do all your hearts good\tsh

\tsh And all your heads too,\tsk provided you
understand it.

Humph! quoth my father to himself, a second time: in muttering

the debate for three minutes and a half.

\tsh When he gets these breeches made, cried my father
in a higher tone, he’ll look like a beast in ’em.\patch{He}

He will be very aukward in them at first, replied my mother.\tsh

\tsh And ’twill be lucky, if that’s\break
the worst on’t, added my father.

It will be very lucky, answered my mother.

I suppose, replied my father,\tsk making some pause
first,\tsk he’ll be exactly like other people’s

mother.

\tsh One must not give him his death,

he shall have no pockets in them.\tsh

\tsh There is no occasion for any,\break
said my mother.\tsh

\tsh I mean so too,\tsk replied my mother.

a quarto \textit{express, De re Vestiaria Veterum},\tsk it was
\textit{Rubenius}’s business to have given my father some
lights.\tsk On the contrary, my father might as well have thought
of extracting the seven cardinal virtues out of a long
beard,\tsk as of extracting a single word out of \textit{Rubenius}
upon the subject.

Upon every other article of ancient dress, \textit{Rubenius} was
very communicative to my father;\tsk gave him a full satisfactory

\rightline{\tsh But}\eject

\tsh But I want to be informed about the breeches, said
my father.

\textit{Albertus Rubenius} informed my father that the
\textit{Romans} manufactured stuffs of various
fabricks,\tsh some plain,\tsk some striped,\tsk others diapered throughout the whole
contexture of the wool, with silk and gold\tsh That linen
did not begin to be in common use till towards the declension of
the empire, when the \textit{Egyptians} coming to settle amongst
them, brought it into vogue.

\tsh That persons of quality and fortune distinguished
themselves by the fineness and whiteness of their cloaths; which
colour (next to purple, which was appropriated to the great
offices) they most affected, and wore on their\catch{birth}
birth-days and
public rejoicings.\tsh That it appeared from the best
historians of those times, that they frequently sent their cloaths
to the fuller, to be cleaned and whitened:\tsh but
that the inferior people, to avoid that expence, generally wore
brown cloaths, and of a something coarser texture,\tsk till
towards the beginning of \textit{Augustus}’s reign, when the
slave dressed like his master, and almost every distinction of
habiliment was lost, but the \textit{Latus Clavus.}

And what was the \textit{Latus Clavus?} said my father.

\textit{Rubenius} told him, that the point was still litigating
amongst the learned:\tsh That \textit{Egnatius, Sigonius,
Bossius Tici\-nensis, Bayfius, Budæus, Salmasius, Lipsius,
Lazius, Isaac Causonbon}, and \textit{Jo-\catch{seph} seph Scaliger}, all
differed from each other,\tsk and he from them: That some took it
to be the button,\tsk some the coat itself,\tsk others only the
colour of it:\tsk\break
That the great \textit{Bayfius}, in his Wardrobe\break

\dropcap{I}{f} the reader has not a clear
conception of the rood and the half of ground which lay at the
bottom of my uncle \toby's kitchen-garden, and which
was the scene of so many of his delicious hours,\tsk the fault is
not in me,\tsk but in his imagination;\tsk for I am sure I gave
him so minute a description, I was almost ashamed of it.

When \textsc{Fate} was looking forwards one afternoon,
into the great transactions of future times,\tsk and recollected
for what purposes, this little plot, by a decree fast bound down in
iron, had been de-\catch{stined,} stined,\tsk she gave a nod to
\textsc{Nature},\tsk ’twas enough\tsk Nature threw
half a spade full of her kindliest compost upon it, with just so
\textit{much} clay in it, as to retain the forms of angles and
indentings,\tsk\break
and so \textit{little} of it too, as not to cling
to the spade, and render works of so much glory, nasty in foul
weather.

My uncle \toby came down, as the reader has been informed,
with plans along with him, of almost every fortified town in
\textit{Italy} and \textit{Flanders}; so let the Duke of
\textit{Marlborough}, or the allies, have set down before what town
they pleased, my uncle \toby was prepared for\break them.

His way, which was the simplest one in the world, was this; as
soon as ever a town was invested\tsk (but sooner when\catch{the} 
the design was known) to take the plan\break
of it, (let it be what town it would)\break
and enlarge it upon a scale to the exact size of his bowling-green;
upon the surface of which, by means of a large role of packthread,
and a number of small piquets driven into the ground, at the
several angles and redans, he transferred the lines from his paper;
then taking the profile of the place, with its works, to determine
the depths and slopes of the ditches,\tsk the talus of the
glacis, and the precise height of the several banquets, parapets,
\&c.\tsk he set the corporal to work\tsh and sweetly went it
on:\tsh The nature of the soil,\tsk the nature of the
work itself,\tsk and above all, the good nature of my uncle
\toby sitting by from morning to night, and chatting kindly
with the corporal upon\catch{past-} past-done deeds,\tsk left
\textsc{labour} little else but the ceremony of the name.

When the place was finished in this 
manner, and put into a proper posture
of defence,\tsk it was invested,\tsk and my\break
uncle \toby and the corporal began to run\break
their first parallel.\tsk I beg I may not\break
be interrupted in my story, by being\break
told, \textit{That the first parallel should be at least three
hundred toises distant from the main body of the place,\tsk and
that I have not left a single inch for it};\tsh for my
uncle \toby took the liberty of incroaching upon his
kitchen garden, for the sake of enlarging his works on the
bowling green, and for that reason generally ran his first and
second parallels betwixt two rows of his cabbages and his
collyflowers; the conveniences and inconveniences of which will be
consi-\catch{dered} dered at large in the history of my\break
uncle \toby's and the corporal’s cam-\break
paigns, of which,
this I’m now writing is but a sketch, and will be finished,
if\break
I conjecture right, in three pages (but there is no
guessing)\tsh The campaigns themselves will take up as
many books; and therefore I apprehend it would be hanging too great
a weight of one kind of matter in so flimsy a performance as this,
to rhapsodize them, as I once intended, into the body of the
work\tsh surely they had better be printed
apart,\break\tsh we’ll consider the affair\tsh so
take the following sketch of them in the mean time.

\etp

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XXII.}

\dropcap{W}{hen} the town, with its works,\break
was finished, my uncle \textit{Toby}\break
and the corporal began to run their first\catch{parallel}
parallel \tsh not at random, or any how\break \tsh but from the
same points and distances the allies had begun to run theirs;
and regulating their approaches and attacks, by the accounts my
uncle \textit{Toby}\break received from the daily papers,\tsk they
went on, during the whole siege, step by step with the allies.

When the duke of \textit{Marlborough} made a
lodgment,\tsh my uncle \toby made a\break lodgment
too.\tsh And when the face of a bastion was battered down,
or a defence ruined,\tsk the corporal took his mattock and did as
much,\tsk and so on;\break
\stick{\tsh gaining ground, and making them-}
\stick{selves masters of the works one after}
\stick{another, till the town fell into their}\break
hands.\patch{To}

To one who took pleasure in the happy state of others,\tsk there
could not have been a greater sight in the world, than, on a
post-morning, in which a\break practicable breach had been made by the
duke of \textit{Marlborough}, in the main body of the place,\tsk
to have stood behind the horn beam hedge, and observed the
spirit with which my uncle \toby, with \textit{Trim}
behind him, sallied forth;\tsh the one with the \textit{Gazette}
in his hand,\tsk the other with a spade on his shoulder to
execute the contents.\tsh What an honest triumph in my uncle
\toby's looks as he marched up to the ramparts! What
intense pleasure swimming in his eye as he stood over the
corporal, reading the paragraph ten times over to him, as he was
at work, lest, peradventure, he should make the breach an inch
too wide,\tsk or\catch{leave} leave it an inch too narrow\tsh But\break when
the \textit{chamade} was beat, and the corporal helped my uncle
up it, and followed with the colours in his hand, to fix them
upon the ramparts\tsk Heaven! Earth!  Sea!\tsh but what avails
apostrophes?\tsh with all your elements, wet or dry, ye never
compounded so intoxicating a draught.

In this track of happiness for many years, without one
interruption to it,\break except now and then when the wind continued to
blow due west for a week or ten days together, which detained the
\textit{Flanders} mail, and kept them so long in torture,\tsk but
still ’twas the torture of the happy\tsh In this
track, I say, did my uncle \toby and \trim move for
many years, every year of which, and sometimes every
month, from the invention\catch{of} of either the one or the other of them,
adding some new conceit or quirk of\break improvement to their
operations, which always opened fresh springs of delight in
carrying them on.

The first year’s campaign was carried on from beginning to
end, in the plain and simple method I’ve related.

In the second year, in which my uncle \toby took
\textit{Liege} and \textit{Ruremond}, he thought he might afford the
expence of four handsome draw-bridges, two of which I have given
an exact description, in the former part of my work.

At the latter end of the same year he added a couple of gates
with port-cullises:\tsh These last were converted\break
afterwards in orgues, as the better thing;\catch{and}
and during the winter of the same year, my uncle \toby,
instead of a new suit of cloaths, which he always had at
\textit{Christmas}, treated himself with a handsome sentry-box,
to stand at the corner of the bowling-green, betwixt which point
and the foot of the glacis, there was left a\break little kind of an
esplanade for him and the corporal to confer and hold councils
of war upon.

\tsh The sentry-box was in case of rain.

All these were painted white three times over the ensuing
spring, which\break enabled my uncle \toby to take the field with
great splendour.

My father would often say to \textit{Yorick}, that if any mortal
in the whole universe\catch{had}
had done such a thing, except his bro\-ther \toby, it
would have been looked upon by the world as one of the most
refined satyrs upon the parade and prancing manner, in which
\textit{Lewis} XIV.\@ from the beginning of the war, but
particularly that very year, had taken the field\break\tsh But ’tis
not my brother \toby's nature, kind soul!\@ my father
would add,\break to insult any one.

\tsh But let us go on.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XXIII.}

\initial{I}{Must} observe, that although in the first year’s
campaign, the word \textit{town} is often mentioned,\tsk yet there was no
town at that time within the polygon;\break that addition was not made
till the summer following the spring in which the bridges and
sentry-box were painted,\catch{which}
\stick{which was the third year of my uncle}
\toby's campaigns,\tsk when upon his taking
\textit{Amberg}, \textit{Bonn}, and \textit{Rhinberg}, and \textit{Huy}
and \textit{Limbourg}, one after another, a thought came into
the corporal’s head, that to talk of taking so many towns,
\textit{without one} \textsc{town} \textit{to shew for it},\tsk
was a very nonsensical way of going to work, and so proposed to
my uncle \toby, that \stick{they should have a little model of a}
town built for them,\tsk to be run up together of slit deals,
and then painted, and clapped within the interior polygon to
serve for all.

My uncle \toby felt the good of the project instantly, and
instantly agreed to it, but with the addition of two singular
improvements, of which he was almost as proud, as if he had been the
original inventor of the project itself.\patch{The}

The one was to have the town built exactly in the style of
those, of which it was most likely to be the
representative:\break\tsh with grated windows, and the gable
ends of the houses, facing the streets, \&c. \&c.\tsk as
those in \textit{Ghent} and\break
\textit{Bruges}, and the rest of the towns in\break
\textit{Brabant} and \textit{Flanders}.

The other was, not to have the houses run up together, as the
corporal propos\-ed, but to have every house independent, to hook on,
or off, so as form into the plan of whatever town they pleased.
This was put directly into hand, and many and many a look of mutual
congratulation was exchanged between my uncle \toby and the
corporal, as the carpenter did the work.\patch{\tsh It}

\tsh It answered prodigiously the next
summer\tsh the town was a perfect
\textit{Proteus}\tsh It was \textit{Landen}, and
\textit{Trerebach}, and \textit{Santvliet}, and \textit{Drusen}, and
\textit{Hagenau},\break
\tsk and then it was \textit{Ostend} and
\textit{Menin}, and \textit{Aeth} and \textit{Dendermond}.\tsh

\tsh Surely never did any \textsc{town} act so
many parts, since \textit{Sodom} and \textit{Gomorrah}, as my uncle
\toby's town did.

In the fourth year, my uncle \toby thinking a town looked
foolishly without a church, added a very fine one with a
steeple.\tsh \trim was for having bells in
it;\tsh my uncle \toby said, the\break
mettle had better be cast into cannon.

This led the way the next campaign for half a dozen brass
field pieces,\tsk to be\catch{planted} 
\stick{\tight{planted three and three on each side of my}}
\stick{uncle \toby's sentry-box; and in a short}
\stick{\tight{time, these led the way for a train of some-}}
what larger,\tsk and so
on\tsk (as must always be the case in hobby-horsical affairs)
from pieces of half an inch bore, till it came at last to my
father’s jack boots.

The next year, which was that in which \textit{Lisle} was
besieged, and at the close of which both \textit{Ghent} and
\textit{Bruges} fell into our hands,\tsk my uncle \toby was
sadly put to it for \textit{proper} ammunition;\break
\tsh I say proper ammunition\tsh because his great artillery
would not bear powder; and ’twas well for the \textit{Shandy}
family they would not\tsh For so full were the papers, from the
beginning to the end of the siege, of the incessant\break firings kept
up by the besiegers,\tsh and so heated was my uncle
\toby's imagina-\catch{tion} tion with the accounts of them, that he
had infallibly shot away all his estate.

\textsc{Something} therefore was wanting,\break
as a \textit{succedaneum}, especially in one or two of the more violent
paroxysms of the siege, to keep up something like a continual
firing in the imagination,\tsh\break
and this \textit{something}, the corporal, whose principal
strength lay in invention, supplied by an entire new system of
battering of his own,\tsk without which, this had been objected
to by military critics, to the end of the world, as one of the
great \textit{desiderata} of my uncle \toby's ap\-paratus.

This will not be explained the worse, for setting off, as I
generally do, at a little distance from the subject.

\dropcap{W}{ith} two or three other trinkets,
small in themselves, but of great regard, which poor \textit{Tom},
the corporal’s unfortunate brother, had sent him over, with
the account of his marriage with the \textit{Jew}’s
widow\tsh there was

\noindent
\stick{\hfill A \textit{Montero}-cap and two \textit{Turkish}
tobacco}\break pipes.

The \textit{Montero}-cap I shall describe by and bye.\tsk The
\textit{Turkish} tobacco pipes\break had nothing particular in them, they
were fitted up and ornamented as usual, with flexible tubes of
\textit{Morocco} leather and gold wire, and mounted at their ends,
the one of them with ivory,\tsk the other with black ebony,
tipp’d with\break silver.\patch{My}

My father, who saw all things in lights different from the rest
of the\break world, would say to the corporal, that he ought to look
upon these two presents more as tokens of his brother’s nicety,
than his affection.\tsh Tom did not care, \trim, he
would say, to put on the cap, or to smoak in the tobacco-pipe of
a \textit{Jew}.\break\tsh God bless your honour, the corporal would
say, (giving a strong reason to the contrary)\tsk how can that
be.\tsh

The Montero-cap was scarlet, of a superfine \textit{Spanish}
cloth, died in grain, and mounted all round with furr, except about
four inches in the front, which was faced with a light blue,
slightly embroidered,\tsk and seemed to have been the property of
a \textit{Portuguese} quarter-\catch{master,} master, not of foot, but of horse, as
the word denotes.

The corporal was not a little proud\break of it, as well for its own
sake, as the\break sake of the giver, so seldom or never\break put it on but
upon \textsc{Gala}-days; and yet never was a Montero-cap put
to so many uses; for in all controverted points, whether military
or culinary, provided the corporal was sure he was in the
right,\break\tsk it was either his \textit{oath},\tsk his
\textit{wager},\tsk\break or his \textit{gift}.

\tsh ’Twas his gift in the present case.

I’ll be bound, said the corporal, speaking to himself, to
\textit{give} away my Montero-cap to the first beggar who comes to the door,
if I do not manage this matter to\break
his honour’s satisfaction.\patch{The}

The completion was no further off, than the very next morning; which was that of the
storm of the counterscarp betwixt the \textit{Lower Deule}, to the right, and the
gate St.\@ \textit{Andrew},\tsk and on the left, between St.\@ \textit{Magdalen}’s
and the river.

As this was the most memorable attack in the whole
war,\tsk the most gallant and obstinate on both sides,\tsk and
I must add the most bloody too, for it cost the allies themselves
that morning above eleven hundred men,\tsk my uncle \textit{Toby}
prepared himself for it with a more than ordinary solemnity.

The eve which preceded, as my uncle \toby went to bed, he
ordered his ramallie wig, which had laid inside out for many years
in the corner of an old campaigning trunk, which stood by his\catch{bed-}
\setlength{\baselineskip}{13.3636pt}% 21*14 = 294   13.363636363636363 
bedside, to be taken out and laid upon the lid of it, ready for the morning;\tsk and the
very first thing he did in his shirt, when he had stepped out of
bed, my uncle \toby, after he had turned the rough side
outwards,\tsk put it on:\tsh\break This done, he proceeded
next to his breeches, and having buttoned the waist-band, he
forthwith buckled on his sword belt, and had got his sword half way
in,\break\tsk when he considered he should want shaving, and that it
would be very inconvenient doing it with his sword on,\tsk so
took it off:\tsh In essaying to put on his regimental coat
and waistcoat, my uncle \toby found the same objection in his
wig,\tsk so that went off too:\tsk So that what with one thing,
and what with another, as always falls out when a man is in the
most haste,\tsk ’twas ten o’clock, which was half an
hour later than his\catch{usual} usual time, before my uncle \toby sallied
out.

\dropcap{M}{y} uncle \toby had scarce
turned the corner of his yew hedge,\break which separated his
kitchen garden from his bowling green, when he perceived the
corporal had begun the attack without him.\tsh

Let me stop and give you a picture of the corporal’s apparatus; and of the corporal
himself in the height of his attack just as it struck my uncle \toby, as he
turned towards the sentry box, where the corporal was at work,\tsh for in nature

\dropcap{T}{he} corporal, who the night before
had resolved in his mind, to\break
supply the grand \textit{desideratum}, of keeping\break up something like an incessant
firing upon the enemy during the heat of the \stick{attack,\tsk had no further idea in his
fancy} at that time, than a contrivance of smoaking tobacco against the town, out of
one of my uncle \toby's six field pieces, which were planted on each side of
his\break
sentry-box; the means of effecting which\break
occurring to his fancy at the same time,\break
though he had pledged his cap, he\catch{thought} thought it in no danger from the miscarriage
of his projects.

Upon turning it this way, and that, a little in his mind, he
soon began to find out, that by means of his two \textit{Tur\-kish}
tobacco-pipes, with the supplement of three smaller tubes of
wash-leather at each of their lower ends, to be tagg’d by the
same number of tin pipes fitted to the touch holes, and sealed with
clay next the cannon, and then tied herme\-tically with waxed silk at
their several insertions into the \textit{Morocco} tube,\tsk he
should be able to fire the six field pieces all together, and with
the same ease as\break to fire one.\tsh 

\etpp
\tsh Let no man say from what taggs and jaggs hints may
not be cut out for the advancement of human knowledge. Let no man, who
has read my father’s first and second \textit{beds of justice},
ever rise up and say again, from collision of what\catch{kinds} kinds of bodies,
light may, or may not be struck out, to carry the arts and sciences
up to perfection.\tsh Heaven!\break thou knowest how I love
them;\tsk thou\break knowest the secrets of my heart, and that I
would this moment give my shirt\break\tsh Thou art a fool,
\textit{Shandy}, says \textit{Eu\-genius}, for thou hast but a dozen in
the world,\tsk and ’twill break thy set.\tsh

No matter for that, \textit{Eugenius}; I would give the shirt off
my back to be burnt into tinder, were it only to satisfy one
feverish enquirer, how many sparks at one good stroke, a good flint
and steel could strike into the tail of it.\tsh\break
Think ye not that in striking these \textit{in},\tsk\break
he might, peradventure, strike something \textit{out?} as sure as a
gun.\tsh

\tsh But this project, by the bye.

The corporal sat up the best part of the night in bringing
\textit{his} to perfection;\catch{and} and having made a sufficient proof of his cannon,
with charging them to the top with tobacco,\tsk he went with
contentment to bed.

\dropcap{T}{he} corporal had slipped out about
ten minutes before my uncle \toby, in order to fix his
apparatus, and just give the enemy a shot or two before my uncle
\toby came.

He had drawn the six field-pieces for this end, all close up
together in front of my uncle \toby's sentry-box,
leaving only an interval of about a yard and a half betwixt the
three, on the right and left, for the convenience of charging,
\&c.\tsk and the sake possibly of two batteries, which he
might think double the honour of one.

In the rear and facing this opening, with his back to the door
of the sentry-\catch{box,} box, for fear of being flanked, had the corporal
wisely taken his post:\tsh He\break held the ivory pipe, appertaining to the battery on
the right, betwixt the finger and thumb of his right
hand,\tsk and the ebony pipe tipp’d with silver, which
appertained to the battery on the left, betwixt the finger and
thumb of the other\break
\tsh and with his right knee fixed firm
upon the ground, as if in the front rank of his platoon, was the
corporal, with his montero-cap upon his head, furiously playing off
his two cross batteries at the same time against the counterguard,
which faced the counterscarp, where the attack was to be made that
morning.\break
His first intention, as I said, was no more than giving
the enemy a single puff or two;\tsk but the pleasure of the
\textit{puffs}, as well as the \textit{puffing}, had insensibly got
hold of the corporal, and drawn him on from puff to puff, into the
very height\catch{of} of the attack, by the time my uncle \toby joined
him.

’Twas well for my father, that my\break uncle \toby had
not his will to make that day.

\dropcap{M}{y} uncle \toby took the ivory
pipe out of the corporal’s hand,\tsk looked at it for half
a minute, and returned it.

In less than two minutes, my uncle \toby took the pipe
from the corporal again, and raised it half way to his
mouth\break
\tsh then hastily gave it back a second time.

The corporal redoubled the attack,\break
\tsh my uncle \toby smiled,\tsh then looked
grave,\tsh then smiled for a moment,\tsh then
looked serious for a long\catch{time;} time;\tsh Give me hold of the
ivory pipe, \trim, said my uncle \textit{Toby}\tsh my

there is one) to your heart’s content.

Vain science! thou assistest us in no case of this

his head) that you might have stood behind any one of your

\dropcap{A}{mongst} the many ill consequences of
the treaty of \textit{Utrecht}, 
\stick{it was within a point of giving my uncle}
\stick{\toby a surfeit of sieges; and though he}
recovered his appetite afterwards, yet\catch{\textit{Calais}} \textit{Calais} itself left not a deeper
scar in \textit{Mary}’s heart, than \textit{Utrecht} upon my\break
uncle \toby's. To the end of his life he never could hear \textit{Utrecht} mentioned upon any
account whatever,\tsk or so much as read an article of news
extracted out of the \textit{Utrecht Gazette}, without fetching a
sigh, as if his heart would break in\break twain.

My father, who was a great \textsc{motive-monger}, and
consequently a very dangerous person for a man to sit by, either\break
laughing or crying,\tsk for he generally\break
knew your motive for doing both, much\break
better than you knew it yourself\tsk would\break
\stick{always console my uncle \toby upon these}\break
occasions, in a way, which shewed\break
plainly, he imagined my uncle \textit{Toby}\break
grieved for nothing in the whole affair,\break
so much as the loss of his \textit{hobby-horse.}\break
\tsk Never mind, brother \toby, he\break
would say,\tsk by God’s blessing we shall\catch{have}
have another
war break out again some of these days; and when it does,\tsk the
belligerent powers, if they would hang themselves, cannot keep us
out of play.\break\tsh I defy ’em, my dear \toby, he
would\break add, to take countries without taking towns,\tsh or
towns without sieges.

My uncle \toby never took this back-stroke of my
father’s at his hobby horse kindly.\tsh He thought
the stroke unge\-nerous; and the more so, because in striking the
horse, he hit the rider too,\break and in the most dishonourable part a
blow could fall; so that upon these oc\-casions, he always laid down
his pipe upon the table with more fire to defend himself than
common.

I told the reader, this time two years, that my uncle
\toby was not eloquent; and in the very same page gave an
instance to the contrary:\tsh I repeat the observation,
and a fact which contradicts\catch{it} it again.\tsk He was not
eloquent,\tsk it was not easy to my uncle \toby to make
long harangues,\tsk and he hated florid ones;\break
but there were occasions where the stream overflowed the man, and ran so counter to
its usual course, that in some parts my uncle \toby, for a time, was at
least equal to \textit{Tertullus}\tsh but in others, in my own opinion, infinitely
above him.

My father was so highly pleased with one of these apologetical
orations of my uncle \toby's, which he had delivered
one evening before him and \textit{Yorick}, that he wrote it down
before he went to bed.

I have had the good fortune to meet with it amongst my
father’s papers, with here and there an insertion of his own,
betwixt two crooks, thus [\quad \quad ], and is
endorsed,\patch{\textit{My}}

\noindent
\stick{\textit{My brother} \textsc{Toby}’\textit{s justification of his}}
\stick{\indent\textit{own principles and conduct in wishing}}
\stick{\indent\textit{to continue the war.\hfill}}

\noindent
I may safely say, I have read over this apologetical oration of
my uncle \toby's a hundred times, and think it so fine
a model of defence,\tsk and shews so sweet a temperament of
gallantry and good principles in him, that I give it the world,
word for word, (interlineations and all), as I find it.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XXXII.}

\smallskip
\centerline{\textit{My  uncle} \textsc{Toby}’\textit{s apologetical  oration}.}

\vskip -9pt\etp

\initial{I}{Am} not insensible, brother \textit{Shandy}, that when a man, whose
profession 
\stick{is arms, wishes, as I have done, for}
\stick{war,\tsk it has an ill aspect to the world;}
\stick{\tsh and that, how just and right soever}
\stick{his motives and intentions may be,\tsk he}
\stck{stands in an uneasy posture in vindicating}
himself from private views in doing it.\patch{For}

For this cause, if a soldier is a prudent man, which he may be,
without being a jot the less brave, he will be sure not to utter
his wish in the hearing of an 
\stick{enemy; for say what he will, an enemy}
will not believe him.\tsh He will be cautious of doing it
even to a friend,\tsk
\stick{lest he may suffer in his esteem:\tsh But}
if his heart is overcharged, and a secret
sigh for arms must have its vent, he will reserve it for the ear of
a brother, who knows his character to the bottom, and what his true
notions, dispositions, and principles of honour are: What, I \textit{hope}, I
have been in all these, brother \textit{Shandy}, would be unbecoming
in me to say:\tsh much worse, I know, have I been than I
ought,\tsk and something worse, perhaps, than I think: But such
as I am, you, my dear brother \textit{Shandy}, who have sucked the
same breasts with me,\tsk and with whom I have been\catch{brought}
brought up from my cradle,\tsk and from whose knowledge, from the first hours of our
boyish pastimes, down to this, I have concealed no one action of my life, and scarce
a thought in it\tsh Such as I am, brother, you must by this time know me, with all
my vices, and with all my weaknesses too, whether of my age, my temper, my passions,
or my understanding.

Tell me then, my dear brother \textit{Shandy}, upon which of them
it is, that when I condemned the peace of \textit{Utrecht}, and
grieved the war was not carried on with vigour a little longer, you
should think your brother did it upon unworthy views; or that in
wishing for war, he should be bad enough to wish more of his
fellow creatures slain,\tsk more slaves made, and more families
driven from their peaceful habitations, merely for his own
pleasure:\tsh Tell me, brother\catch{\textit{Shandy},} \textit{Shandy}, upon what
one deed of mine do you ground it? [\textit{The devil a deed do I\break know
of, dear} Toby, \textit{but one for a hun-\break dred pounds, which I lent
thee to carry on\break these cursed sieges.}]

If, when I was a school-boy, I could not hear a drum beat, but
my heart beat with it\tsk was it my fault?\tsh Did I\break
plant the propensity there?\tsh did I sound the alarm
within, or Nature?

When \textit{Guy}, Earl of \textit{Warwick}, and \stick{\textit{Parismus} and
\textit{Parismenus}, and \textit{Valentine}}
\stick{and \textit{Orson}, and the
\textit{Seven Champions of}} \textit{England}, were handed around the
school,\break\tsk were they not all purchased with my own pocket money?
Was that selfish, brother \textit{Shandy?} When we read over the
siege of \textit{Troy}, which lasted ten years and eight
months,\tsh though with such a train of artillery as we
had at \textit{Namur}, the town might have been carried in a\catch{week}
\stick{week\tsk was I not as much concerned for} the
destruction of the \textit{Greeks} and \textit{Trojans} as any boy of
the whole school? Had I not three strokes of a ferula given me, two
on my right hand, and one on my left, for calling \textit{Helena} a
bitch for it? Did any one of you shed more tears for \textit{Hector?}
And when king \textit{Priam} came to the camp to beg his body, and
returned weeping back to \textit{Troy} without it,\tsk you know,
brother, I could not eat my\break dinner.\tsh

\tsh Did that bespeak me cruel? Or because, brother
\textit{Shandy}, my blood flew out into the camp, and my heart panted
for war,\tsk was it a proof it could not ache for the distresses
of war too?

O brother! ’tis one thing for a soldier to gather
laurels,\tsk and ’tis another to scatter
cypress.\tsh [\textit{Who told thee,\catch{my} my dear} Toby, \textit{that cypress
was used by\break the ancients on mournful occasions?} ]

\tsh ’Tis one thing, brother \textit{Shandy},\break
for a soldier to hazard his own life\tsk to leap first down into the trench, where
he is sure to be cut in pieces:\tsh ’Tis one thing, from public spirit and a thirst
of glory, to enter the breach the first man,\break\stick{\tsk to stand in the foremost
rank, and}
march bravely on with drums and trumpets, and colours flying about his ears:\break
\tsh ’Tis one thing, I say, brother \textit{Shandy}, to do this\tsk and ’tis another
thing to reflect on the miseries of war;\break
\tsk to view the desolations of whole
countries, and consider the intolerable fatigues and hardships which the soldier
himself, the instrument who works them, is forced (for six-pence a day,
if he can\break get it) to undergo.

Need I be told, dear \textit{Yorick}, as I was by you, in \textit{Le
Fever}’s funeral ser-\catch{mon,} mon, \textit{That so soft and gentle a
creature, born to love, to mercy, and kindness, as man is, was not
shaped for this?}\tsh But\break why did you not add,
\textit{Yorick},\tsk if not by \textsc{nature}\tsk that he
is so by \textsc{necessity}?\break
\tsk For what is war? what is it, \textit{Yorick},\break
when fought as ours has been, upon
principles of \textit{liberty}, and upon principles of
\textit{honour}\tsk what is it, but the getting together of quiet
and harmless people, with their swords in their hands, to keep the
ambitious and the turbulent within bounds? And heaven is my
witness, brother \textit{Shandy}, that the pleasure I have taken in
these things,\tsk and that infinite delight, in particular, which
has attended my sieges in my bowling-green, has arose within me,
and I hope in the corporal too, from the consciousness we both had,
that in carrying them on, we were answering the great ends of our\break
creation.

with himself, and not lay the blame entirely upon this book,\tsh

I told him, Sir\tsh for in good truth, when a man is
telling a story in the strange way I do mine, he is obliged

knowing that the\catch{world} world is apt to lose its way, with all the lights
the sun itself at noon day can give it\tsh and now, you see, I am lost\break myself!\tsh

\tsh But ’tis my father’s fault; and\break
\stck{whenever my brains come to be dissected,}\break you will perceive, without
spectacles, that he has left a large uneven thread, as you

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XXXIV.}

\initial{I}{Told} the Christian reader in the beginning of the chapter which
preceded my uncle \toby's apologetical oration,\tsk though in a different
trope from what I should make use of now, That the peace of \textit{Utrecht} was
within an ace of creating the same shyness betwixt my uncle \toby and his
hobby-horse, as it did betwixt the queen and the rest of the confederating powers.

There is an indignant way in which a\break
man sometimes dismounts his horse,\break
which, as good as says to him, \lqq I’ll go\break
\lqq afoot, Sir, all the days of my life\break
\lqq before I would ride a single mile upon\break
\lqq your back again.” Now my uncle\break
\toby could not be said to dismount his\break
horse in this manner; for in strictness of\break
language, he could not be said to dis-\catch{mount} mount his horse at all\tsh his horse rather flung him\tsh and
somewhat \textit{viciously}, which made my uncle \toby take it ten times
more unkindly. Let this\break
matter be settled by state jockies as they like.\tsh It
created, I say, a sort of shy-\break ness betwixt my uncle \toby and his
hobby-horse.\tsh He had no occasion for him from the month of \textit{March} to
\textit{November}, which was the summer after the articles were signed, except it
was now and then to take a short ride out, just to see that the fortifications and
harbour of \textit{Dunkirk} were demolished, according to stipulation.

The \textit{French} were so backwards all that\break
\stick{summer in setting about that affair, and}
\stick{Monsieur \textit{Tugghe}, the deputy from the}
\stick{\tight{magistrates of \textit{Dunkirk}, presented so many}}
\stick{\tight{affecting petitions to the queen,\tsk beseech-}}
\stick{\tight{ing her majesty to cause only her thunder-}}
\stick{\tight{bolts to fall upon the martial works, which}}\catch{might}
might have
incurred her displeasure,\tsk but to spare\tsk to spare the
mole, for the mole’s sake; which, in its naked situation,
could be no more than an object of pity\tsh and the queen
(who was but a woman) being of a pitiful
disposition,\tsk and her ministers also, they not wishing in
their hearts to have the town 
\stick{dismantled, for these private reasons, \ast\ \ast}
\stick{\astfill}
\hbox to 64pt{\astfill\tsh}

\noindent
\stick{\indent\astfill}
\stick{\astfill}
\stick{\astfill; so that the whole went hea-}
vily on with my uncle \toby; insomuch, that it
was not within three full months, after he and the corporal had
constructed the town, and put it in a condition to be destroyed,
that the several commandants, commissaries, deputies, negociators,
and intendants, would permit\catch{him} him to set about
it.\tsh Fatal interval of inactivity!

The corporal was for beginning the demolition, by making a
breach in the ramparts, or main fortifications of the
town\tsh No,\tsk that will never do, cor-\break poral, said my
uncle \toby, for in going that way to work with the town, the\break
\textit{English} garrison will not be safe in it an hour; because if
the French are treache\-rous\tsh They are as treacherous as de-\break vils,
an’ please your honour, said the\break
\stick{corporal\tsh It gives me concern always}
\stick{when I hear it, \trim, said my uncle}
\stick{\toby;\tsk for they don’t want personal bra-}
\stick{very; and if a breach is made in the}
\stick{ramparts, they may enter it, and make}
\stick{themselves masters of the place when}
\stick{they please:\tsk Let them enter it, said}
\stick{the corporal, lifting up his pioneer’s}
\stick{spade in both his hands, as if he was}\break\etp
\stick{going to lay about him with it,\tsk let}
them enter, an’ please your honour, if\catch{they}
they dare.\tsh In cases like this, corporal, said my uncle
\toby, slipping his\break
right hand down to the middle of his\break
cane, and holding it afterwards trun-\break 
cheon-wise with his forefinger extended,\break
\tsh ’tis no part of the consideration of a
commandant, what the enemy dare,\tsk or what they dare not do; he
must act with prudence. We will begin with the outworks both
towards the sea and the land, and particularly with fort
\textit{Louis},\break
the most distant of them all, and demolish it
first,\tsk and the rest, one by one, both on our right and left, as we retreat towards
the town;\tsh then we’ll demo\-lish the
mole,\tsk next fill up the harbour,\break
\tsk then retire into the citadel, and blow it up into the air: and
having done\break
that, corporal, we’ll embark for \textit{England.}\tsh We are there, quoth the
corporal, recollecting himself\tsh Very true, said my uncle \textit{Toby}\tsk
looking at the church.

\dropcap{N}{ow}, because I have once or twice
said, in my inconsiderate way of \stick{talking, That I was confident the
follow-}\break
\stick{\tight{ing memoirs of my uncle \toby's courtship}}
of
widow \textit{Wadman}, whenever I got time to write them, would turn
out one of the most compleat systems, both of the elementary and
practical part of love and love-making, that ever was addressed to
the world\tsh are you to imagine from thence, that I shall
set out with a description of \textit{what love is?} whether part God
and part Devil, as \textit{Plotinus} will have\break
it\tsh

\tsh Or by a more critical equation, and supposing the
whole of love to be as ten\tsh to determine with
\textit{Ficinus},\break
\lqq\textit{How many parts of it\tsk the one,\tsk
and}\catch{\lqq \textit{how}}
\lqq \textit{how many the other};\,”\tsk or whether it
is \textit{all of it one great Devil}, from head to tail, as
\textit{Plato} has taken upon him to pronounce; concerning which
conceit of his, I shall not offer my opinion:\break
\tsk but my opinion of \textit{Plato} is this; that
he appears, from this instance, to have been a man of much the same
temper and way of reasoning with doctor \textit{Baynyard},
who being a great enemy to blis-\break
ters, as imagining that half a dozen of\break
’em on at once, would draw a man as surely to his grave, as a
herse and six\tsk rashly concluded, that the Devil himself was
nothing in the world, but one great bouncing
\textit{Cantharidis.}\tsh

I have nothing to say to people who allow themselves this
monstrous liberty in arguing, but what \textit{Nazianzen} cried out
(\textit{that is polemically}) to
\textit{Philagrius}\tsh

\indent\lqq Εὖγε!” \textit{O rare! ’tis fine reasoning, Sir, indeed!}\tsk
\lqq ὅτι φιλοσοφεῖς ἐν Πάθεσι”\catch{\textit{and}}
\tsk \textit{and most nobly do you aim at truth, when you philosophize about
it in your moods and passions.}

Nor is it to be imagined, for the same reason, I should stop to
inquire, whether love is a disease,\tsh or embroil myself
with \textit{Rhasis} and \textit{Dioscorides}, whether the seat of it
is in the brain or liver;\tsk because this would lead me on, to
an examination of the two very opposite manners, in
which patients have been treated\tsh the one, of
\textit{Aœtius}, who always begun with a cooling glyster of
hempseed and bruised cucumbers;\tsk and followed on with thin
potations of water lilies and purslane\tsk to which he added a
pinch of snuff, of the herb \textit{Hanea};\tsk and where
\textit{Aœtius} durst venture it,\tsk his\break
topaz-ring.

\tsh The other, that of \textit{Gordonius}, who (in his
cap.\@ 15.\@ \textit{de Amore}) directs\catch{they} they should be thrashed,
“\textit{ad putorem usque},”\tsh till they stink
again.

These are disquisitions, which my father, who had laid in a great
stock of knowledge of this kind, will be very busy with, in the
progress of my uncle\break
\toby's affairs: I must anticipate thus much, That from his theories of
love, (with which, by the way, he contrived to crucify my uncle \toby's
mind, almost as much as his amours themselves)\tsk he\break took a single step into
practice;\tsk and by means of a camphorated cerecloth, which he found means to
impose upon the taylor for buckram, whilst he was making my uncle \toby a
new pair of breeches, he produced \textit{Gordonius}’s effect upon my uncle
\toby without the disgrace.

What changes this produced, will be read in its proper place:
all that is need-\catch{ful} ful to be added to the anecdote, is
this\break\tsh That whatever effect it had upon my uncle
\toby,\tsh it had a vile effect upon the
house;\tsh and if my uncle \toby had not smoaked it
down as he did, it might have had a vile effect upon my\break father
too.

\dropcap{\Tsk ’T}{will} come out of itself\break
by and bye.\tsk All I con-\break tend for is, that I am
not \textit{obliged} to set out with a definition of what love is; and so
long as I can go on with my story intelligibly, with the help of
the word itself, without any other idea to it, than what I have in
common with the rest of the world, why should I differ from it
a moment before the time?\tsh When I\catch{can}

telling the reader, my uncle \textit{Toby fell in love:}

\tsk Not that the phrase is at all to my liking: for to say a

\tsk or that he is \textit{deeply} in love,
\tsk or up to the ears in love,\tsk and sometimes even

of implication, that love is a thing \textit{below} a man:\tsk this
is recurring again to \textit{Plato}’s opinion, which, with all
his divinityship,\tsk I hold to be damnable and
heretical:\tsk and so much for that.

my mother, which will surprise you greatly.\tsh

Now my father was then holding one of his second beds of
justice, and was musing within himself about the hardships of

“\tsk My brother \toby, quoth she,\break
\lqq is going to be married to Mrs.\@ \textit{Wad-}\break
\lqq \textit{man}.\,”

\tsh Then he will never, quoth my father, be able to
lie \textit{diagonally} in his bed again as long as he lives.

It was a consuming vexation to my father, that my mother never
asked the meaning of a thing she did not understand.\patch{\tsh
That}

\tsh That she is not a woman of science, my father
would say\tsk is her misfortune\tsk but she might ask a

My mother never did.\tsh In short, she went out of the
world at last without knowing whether it turned \textit{round}, or
stood \textit{still.}\tsh My father had officiously told her
above a thousand times which way it was,\tsk but she always
forgot.

For these reasons, a discourse seldom went on much further
betwixt them, than a proposition,\tsk a reply, and a rejoinder;
at the end of which, it gene\-rally took breath for a few minutes (as

my work; and by the help of a vegitable\sic\ diet, with a few of the
cold seeds, I make no doubt but I shall be able to go on with my
uncle \toby's story, and my own, in a tolerable

By which it appears, that except at the curve,
marked A. where I took a trip to \textit{Navarre},\tsk and the
indented curve B. which is the short airing when I was there with
the Lady \textit{Baussiere} and her page,\tsk I have not taken the
least frisk of a digression, till \textit{John de la Casse}’s\break
devils led me the round you see marked\break
\stick{D.\tsk for as for \textit{c c c c c} they are nothing}
but parentheses, and the common \textit{ins} and
\textit{outs} incident to the lives of the greatest ministers of state; and
when com-\catch{pared} pared with what men have done,\tsk or with my own
transgressions at the letters\break A B D\tsk they vanish
into nothing.

In this last volume I have done better still\tsk for from the
end of \textit{Le Fever}’s episode, to the beginning of my uncle
\toby's campaigns,\tsk I have scarce stepped a yard
out of my way.

If I mend at this rate, it is not impossible\tsh by the
good leave of his grace of \textit{Benevento}’s
devils\tsh but I may arrive hereafter at the excellency of\break
going on even thus;\\[10pt]

which is a line drawn as straight as I could draw
it, by a writing-master’s\break ruler, (borrowed for that purpose),
turning neither to the right hand or to the\break left.\patch{This}

This \textit{right line},\tsk the path-way for Christians to
walk in! say divines\tsh

\tsh The emblem of moral rectitude! says
\textit{Cicero}\tsh

\tsh \textit{The best line!} say cabbage-plan-\break ters\tsh is the shortest line,
says \textit{Archi\-medes},
which can be drawn from one given point to
another.\tsh

I wish your ladyships would lay\break this matter to heart, in your
next birth-\break day suits!

\tsh What a journey!

Pray can you tell me,\tsk that is, with-\break
out anger, before I write my chapter\break
upon straight lines\tsh by what mis-\break
take\tsh who told them so\tsh or how it\break
has come to pass, that your men of wit\break
