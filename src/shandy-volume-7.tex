\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace I.}

\dropcap{N}{o}\tsh I think, I said, I
would write two volumes every year,\break provided the vile cough which
then tormented me, and which to this hour I dread worse than the
devil, would but give me leave\tsk and in another
place\tsk (but where, I can’t recollect now) speaking of my
book as a \textit{machine}, and laying my pen and ruler down
cross-wise\catch{upon} upon the table, in order to gain the greater credit to
it\tsk I swore it should be kept a going at that rate these forty
years, if it pleased but the fountain of life to bless me so long
with health and good spirits.

Now as for my spirits, little have I to lay to their
charge\tsk nay so very little (unless the mounting me upon a long
stick, and playing the fool with me nineteen hours out of the
twenty-four, be accusations) that on the contrary, I have
much\tsk much to thank ’em for:\break 
\stick{cheerily have ye made me tread the path}
of life with all the burdens of it (except its
cares) upon my back; in no one moment of my existence, that I
remember, have ye once deserted me, or tinged the objects which
came in my way, either with\catch{sable,}
\stick{sable, or with a sickly green; in dangers}
\stick{\tight{ye gilded my horizon with hope, and when}}
\textsc{Death} himself knocked at my door\tsk ye bad him
come again; and in so gay a tone of careless indifference, did ye
do it, that he doubted of his commission\tsh

\indent\lqq\tsh There must certainly be some\break\lqq mistake in this
matter,\,” quoth he.

Now there is nothing in this world I abominate worse, than to be
interrupted in a story\tsh and I was that moment telling
Eugenius a most tawdry one in my way, of a nun who fancied
herself a shell-fish, and of a monk damn’d for\break eating a
muscle, and was shewing him the grounds and justice of the
procedure\tsh\patch{\lqq\tsk Did}

\lqq\tsk Did ever so grave a personage\break
\lqq get into so vile a scrape?” quoth\break
Death. Thou hast had a narrow escape,
Tristram, said Eugenius, taking hold of my hand as I
finish’d my story\tsh

But there is no \textit{living}, Eugenius, re-\break plied I, at this
rate; for as this \textit{son of a whore} has found out my
lodgings\tsh

\tsk You call him rightly, said Eugenius,\break
\tsk for by sin, we are told, he enter’d the world\tsh I care not which way he
\stick{enter’d, quoth I, provided he be not in} such a hurry to take me out with him\tsk for
I have forty volumes to write, and forty thousand things to say and do, which no body
in the world will say and do for me, except thyself; and as thou\catch{seest} seest he has got
me by the throat (for\break
Eugenius could scarce hear me speak across the table), and
that I am no match for him in the open field, had I not better, 
whilst these few scatter’d spirits remain, 
\stick{and these two spider legs of mine holding}
\stick{one of them up to him) are able to support} 
me\tsk had I not better, Eugenius, fly for my life? ’tis my
advice, my dear Tristram, said Eugenius\tsk then by heaven! I
will lead him a dance he little thinks of\tsh for I will gallop,
quoth I, without looking once behind me, to the banks of the
\stick{Garonne; and if I hear him clattering} at my heels\tsh
I’ll scamper away to mount Vesuvius\tsh from thence to Jop\-pa,
and from Joppa to the world’s end; where, if he follows me, I
pray God he may break his neck\tsh\patch{\tsh He}

\tsh He runs more risk \textit{there}, said Eugenius,
than thou.

Eugenius’s wit and affection brought blood into the
cheek from whence it had been some months
banish’d\tsh ’twas a vile moment to bid adieu
in; he led me\break to my chaise\tsh \textit{Allons!}\@ said I; the
post boy gave a crack with his whip\tsh off I went like a
cannon, and in half a dozen bounds got into Dover.

\dropcap{I}{t} is a great inconvenience to a man in a haste, that there are three
distinct roads between Calais and Paris, in behalf of which there
is so much to be said by the several deputies from the towns which lie along them,
that half a day is easily lost in settling which you’ll take.

First, the road by Lisle and Arras, which is the
most about\tsh but most interesting, and instructing.

The second that by Amiens, which you may go, if you
would see Chantilly\tsh

And that by Beauvais, which you may go, if you will.\patch{For}

For this reason a great many chuse to go by Beauvais.

\dropcap{\lower-10pt\hbox{\normalsize\large\lqq}N}{ow} before I quit

\tsk that a man
cannot go quietly through a town and let it alone, when it does not meddle with him,
but that he must be turning about and drawing his pen at every kennel he crosses
over, merely o’ my conscience for the sake of drawing it; because, if we may judge

appeal\tsk I know no more of Calais, (except the little my barber told me of it, as he
was whetting his razor) than I do this moment of \textit{Grand Cairo}; for it was
dusky in the evening when I landed, and dark as pitch in the morning when I set out,
and yet by merely know-\catch{ing}

the town, and by spelling and putting this and that together in another\tsk I would
lay any tra\-velling odds, that I this moment write a chapter upon Calais as

is worth a stranger’s curiosity in the town\tsk that you would take me for the

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace V.}

\dropcap{C}{alais}, \textit{Calatium, Calusium,\break
Calesium.}

This town, if we may trust it's\sic\ ar\-chives, the authority of which
I see no reason to call in question in this place\tsk was
\textit{once} no more than a small village belonging to one of the
first Counts de Guines; and as it boasts at present of no
less than fourteen thousand inhabitants, exclusive of four hundred
and twenty distinct families in the \textit{basse ville}, or
suburbs\tsh it must have grown up by little and little, I
suppose, to it's\sic\ present size.\patch{Though}

Though there are four convents, there is but one parochial church in the whole town;
I had not an opportunity of taking its exact dimensions, but it is pretty easy to
make a tolerable conjecture of ’em\tsk\break for as there are fourteen thousand
inhabitants in the town, if the church holds them all it must be considerably
large\tsk and if it will not\tsk ’tis a very great pity they have not another\tsk it
is built in form of a cross, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary; the steeple which
has a spire to it, is placed in the middle of the church, and stands upon four
pillars elegant and light enough, but sufficiently strong at the same time\tsk it is
decorated with eleven altars, most of which are rather fine than beautiful. The
great altar is a master-piece in its kind; ’tis of white marble, and as I was
told near sixty feet high\tsk\catch{had} had it been much higher, it had been as high as
mount Calvary itself\tsk therefore, I suppose it must be high enough in all
conscience.

There was nothing struck me more than the great \textit{Square};
tho’ I cannot say\break
\stck{’tis either well paved or well built; but ’tis}\break in the heart of the town, and most of the streets,
especially those in that quarter, all terminate in it; could there
have been a fountain in all Calais, which it seems there
cannot, as such an object would have been a great ornament, it is
not to be doubted, but that the inhabitants would have had it in
the very centre of this square,\tsk not that it is properly a
square,\break\tsk because ’tis forty feet longer from
east to west, than from north to south; so that the French
in general have more\catch{reason} reason on their side in calling them
\textit{Places} than \textit{Squares}, which, strictly speaking, to be
sure they are not.

The town-house seems to be but a sorry building, and not to be
kept in the best repair; otherwise it had been a second great
ornament to this place; it answers however its destination, and
serves very well for the reception of the magistrates, who assemble
in it from time to time; so that ’tis presumable, justice is
regularly distributed.

I have heard much of it, but there is nothing at all curious in
the \textit{Courgain}; ’tis a distinct quarter of the town,
inhabi\-ted solely by sailors and fishermen; it consists of a number
of small streets, neatly built and mostly of brick; ’tis\catch{extremely}
extremely populous, but as that may be accounted for, from the
principles of their diet,\tsk there is nothing curious in that
neither.\tsh A traveller may see it to satisfy
himself\tsk he must not omit however taking notice of \textit{La Tour de Guet}, upon
any account; ’tis so called from its particular destination,
because in war it serves to discover and give notice of the enemies
which approach the place, either by sea or land;\tsh but
’tis monstrous high, and catches the eye so continually, you
cannot avoid taking notice of it, if you would.

It was a singular disappointment to me, that I could not have
permission to take an exact survey of the fortifications, which are
the strongest in the world, and\catch{which,} which, from first to last, that is,
for the time they were set about by Philip of France
Count of Bologne, to the present war, wherein many
reparations were made, have cost (as I learned afterwards from an
engineer in Gascony)\tsk above a hundred millions of
livres. It is very remarkable, that at the \textit{Tête de
Gra\-ve\-lenes}, and where the town is naturally the weakest, they
have expended the most money; so that the outworks stretch a great
way into the campaign, and consequently occupy a large tract of
ground.\break\tsk However, after all that is \textit{said} and
\textit{done}, it must be acknowledged that Calais was never
upon any account so considerable from itself, as from its
situation, and that easy enterance\sic\ which it gave our ancestors upon
all occasions into France: it was not without its
inconveniences\catch{also;} also; being no less troublesome to the
English in those times, than Dunkirk has been to us,
in ours; so that it was deservedly looked upon as the key to both
kingdoms, which no doubt is the reason that there have arisen so
many contentions who should keep it: of these, the siege of
Calais, or rather the blockade (for it was shut up both by
land and sea) was the most memorable, as it with-stood the efforts
of Edward the third a whole year, and was not terminated at
last but by famine and extream misery; the gallantry of \textit{Eustace
de St.\@ Pierre}, who first offered himself a victim for his
fellow citizens, has rank’d his name with heroes. As it will
not take up above fifty pages, it would be injustice to the reader,
not to give him a\catch{minute} minute account of that romantic transaction, as well
as of the siege itself, in Rapin’s own words:

\dropcap{W}{hen} the precipitancy of a

the vehicle he rides in\tsk woe be to truth! and woe be to the
vehicle and its tackling (let ’em be made of what stuff you
will) upon which he breathes forth the disappointment of his
soul!

As I never give general characters either of men or things in
choler, \lqq\textit{the most haste, the worse speed},\,” was
all the re-\catch{flection} flection I made upon the affair, the first time it
happen’d;\tsk the second, third, fourth, and fifth time, I
confined it respectively to those times, and accordingly blamed
only the second, third, fourth, and fifth post-boy for it, without
carrying my reflections further; but the event
continuing to befall me from the fifth, to the sixth, seventh,
eighth, ninth, and tenth time, and without one exception, I then
could not avoid making a national reflection of it, which I do in
these words;

\textit{That something is always wrong in a French post-chaise upon
first setting out}.

Or the proposition may stand thus.

\textit{A French postilion has always to alight\catch{before} before he has got
three hundred yards out of town}.

What’s wrong now?\tsh Diable!\tsh\break
a rope’s broke!\tsh a knot has slipt!\break
\tsh a staple’s drawn!\tsh a bolt’s to whittle!\tsh a tag, a
rag, a jag, a\break strap, a buckle, or a
buckle’s tongue, want altering.\tsh

Now true as all this is, I never think\break myself impower’d to
excommunicate thereupon either the post-chaise, or its
driver\tsh nor do I take it into my head to swear by the
living G\tsk, I would rather go a foot ten thousand
times\tsh or that I will be damn’d if ever I get
into another\tsh but I take the matter coolly
before me, and consider, that some tag, or\catch{rag,} rag, or jag, or bolt, or
buckle, or buckle’s tongue, will ever be a wanting, or want
altering, travel where I will\tsk so\break I never chaff, but take the
good and the bad as they fall in my road, and get
on:\tsh Do so, my lad! said I; he had lost five minutes
already, in alighting in order to get at a luncheon of black bread,
which he had cramm’d\break into the chaise-pocket, and was
remounted and going leisurely on, to relish it the
better.\tsh Get on, my lad, said I, briskly\tsk but in
the most persuasive tone imaginable, for I jingled a
four and twenty sous piece against the glass, taking care to hold
the flat side towards him, as he look’d back: the dog
grinn’d intelligence from his right ear to his left, and
behind his sooty\catch{muzzle} muzzle discover’d such a pearly row of teeth, that
\textit{Sovereignty} would have pawn’d her jewels for
them.\tsh

\noindent
Just heaven! $\Big\{\vcenter{\halign{#\hss\cr What masticators!\tsh\cr What bread!\tsh\cr}}$

and so, as he finish’d the last mouthful of it, we
enter’d the town of Montreuil.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace IX.}

\dropcap{T}{here} is not a town in all France, which in my opinion, looks better in the
map, than \textsc{Montreuil};\tsh I own, it does not look so well in the book of
post roads; but when you come to see it\tsk to be sure it looks most pitifully.

There is one thing however in it at present very handsome; and that is the
inn-keeper’s daughter: She has been eighteen months at Amiens, and six at
Paris, in going through her classes; so knits, and sews, and dances, and
does the little coquetries very well.\tsh

\tsk A slut! in running them over with\-in these five minutes

\tsk But as this sample is worth all their thumbs\tsh besides I

\noindent
\stick{\indent\tight{\tsk But your worships chuse rather that I}}\break give you the length, breadth, and

’faith, scarce for her picture\tsh were it but painted by Reynolds\tsk

\tsk But if I go on with my drawing, after naming that son of

So you must e’en be content with the original; which, if the evening is fine in

submitting to it before my friends; and therefore, I never

things may so order it, that it happen not to me in my own

it,\tsh the concern of my friends, and the last services of
wiping my brows and smoothing my\catch{pillow,} pillow, which the quivering
hand of pale affection shall pay me, will so crucify my soul,
that I shall die of a distemper which my physician is not aware
of: but in an inn, the few cold offices I wanted, would be
purchased with a few guineas, and paid me with an undisturbed,

and that restless spirit for making it,\break
\stck{which David prophetically foresaw would}\break haunt the
children of men in the latter days; and therefore, as thinketh the great bishop
Hall, ’tis one of the se\-ver\-est imprecations which
David ever utter’d against the enemies of the

\lqq about\,”\tsk So much
motion, continues he, (for he was very corpulent)\tsk is so much
unquietness; and so much of\catch{rest,} rest, by the same analogy, is so much
of heaven.

Now, I (being very thin) think differently; and that so much of
motion, is so much of life, and so much of joy\break

\textit{whereonto}, for that would make an Ixion’s wheel of it)
he curseth his enemies, according to the\catch{bishop’s}
bishop’s habit of body, should certainly be a post-chaise wheel, whether they were
set up in Palestine at that time or not\tsh and my wheel, for the contrary reasons,
must as certainly be a cart-wheel groaning round its revolution once in an age; and
of which sort, were I to turn commentator, I should make no scruple to affirm, they
had great store in that hilly country.

I love the Pythagoreans (much more than ever I dare tell my dear Jenny) for\break

one of two hundred Italian miles multiplied into itself,

of which he had read, without reflecting how much, by a gradual and
most tabid decline, in the course of eighteen hundred years, they
must unavoidably have shrunk, so as to have come, when he wrote,
almost to nothing.\patch{In}

In Lessius’s time, who seems the cooler man, they
were as little as can be imagined\tsh

it)\tsh there is no help: and it is this.

That be you in never so kindly a pro-\break

was you as demonstratively satisfied as you can be of any truth in
Euclid, that you should upon all accounts be full as well
asleep as awake\tsh nay perhaps better\tsh\break
Yet the incessant returns of paying for the horses at every
stage,\tsh with the necessity thereupon of putting your
hand into your pocket, and counting out from thence, three livres
fifteen sous (sous by sous) puts an end to so much of the project,
that you cannot execute above six miles of it (or supposing it is a
post and a half, that is but nine)\tsh were it to save
your soul from destruction.\patch{\tsh I’ll}

\tsh I’ll be even with ’em, quoth I,\break
for I’ll put the precise sum into a piece\break
of paper, and hold it ready in my hand\break

altercations (as a man cannot dispute very well asleep) rouse him: still is sweet
sleep retrievable; and still might the flesh weigh down the spirit, and recover
itself of these blows\tsk but then, by heaven!\catch{you}
you have paid but for a single post\break
\tsk whereas ’tis a post and a half; and this obliges you to pull out your book of

points to argue, or consider over in your mind; in doing of which, the rational
powers get so thoroughly awakened\tsh you may get ’em to sleep again as you can.\patch{It}

It was entirely owing to one of these misfortunes, or I had
pass’d clean by the stables of

lap\tsh then decoc-\break tions of wild chicory, water-cresses, chervil,

of Bourbon\tsh so having first obtain’d leave of the

\stick{into the abbess’s cast poultices, \etc \tsk had}
gained such an interest, that overlooking a sciatical old nun, who might have been set up

little novice, was elected as the companion of the\break
journey.

\stick{\indent\tight{An old calesh, belonging to the abbesse,}}\break

disposed behind the calesh, with a large russet coloured
riding coat over it, to guard it from the sun; and as the weather
was hot, and he, not a niggard of his labours, walking ten times
more than he rode\tsk he found more occasions than those of

\tsh The muleteer was a son of Adam.
I need not say a word more. He gave

he enter’d the little inn at the foot of the hill.

The muleteer, as I told you, was a\break
little, joyous, chirping fellow, who 
thought not of to-morrow, nor of what 
\stick{had gone before, or what was to follow it,}
provided he got but his
scantling of Burgundy, and a little chit-chat along with it; so
entering into a long conversation, as how he was chief gardener
to the convent of Andoüillets, \etc\etc and out of friendship
for the abbess and Mademoiselle Margarita, who was only in her
noviciate, he had come along with them from the confines of
Savoy, \etc - - \etc- -\break and as how she had got a white
swelling by her devotions\tsk and what a nation of herbs he had
procured to mollify her humours, \etc\etc and that if the wa-\catch{ters}

lame of both\tsk \etc
\stck{\etc\etc\tsk He so contrived his story, as abso-}
\stck{lutely to forget the heroine of it\tsk and with}
her the little novice, and what was a more ticklish point to be forgot

let us leave him then in the vor-\catch{tex} tex of his element, the happiest

look after the mules, the abbess, and Margarita.

By virtue of the muleteer’s two last strokes, the mules had
gone quietly on, following their own consciences up the hill, till
they had conquer’d about one half of it; when the elder of
them, a shrewd crafty old devil, at the turn of an angle, giving a

\quad\tsh All you need say of \textit{Fontain-\break bleau} (in case you are ask’d)
is, that it\break\stick{\tight{stands about forty miles (south \textit{something})}}\break
from Paris, in the middle of a large\break

there once every two or three years, with his whole court, for the pleasure of the

(you need not forget yourself) may be accommodated with a nag or two, to partake of
the sport, taking care only not to out-gallop the king\tsh

Though there are two reasons why you need not talk loud of this
to every one.\patch{First,}

First, Because ’twill make the said nags the harder to be

Secondly, ’Tis not a word of it

dispatch it\break in a word\tsh \lqq\textit{’Tis an

\tsh For \textsc{Joigny}\tsk the less, I think,\break
one says of it the better.

But for \textsc{Auxerre}\tsk I could go on for ever: for
in my \textit{grand tour} through Europe, in which, after all,
my father (not caring to trust me with any one) attended me
himself, with my uncle Toby, and Trim, and
Obadiah, and indeed most of the family, except my mother,
who being\catch{taken}
taken up with a project of knitting my father a pair of large worsted breeches\tsk
(the thing is common sense)\tsk and she not caring to be put out of her way, she
staid at home at \ls{\textsc{Shandy Hall}}, to keep\break things right during the expedition;
in which, I say, my father stopping us two days at Auxerre, and his researches being
ever of such a nature, that they would have found fruit even in a desert\tsh he has
left me enough to say upon \textsc{Auxerre}: in short, wherever my father went\tsh
but ’twas more remarkably so, in this journey through France and Italy, than in any
other stages of his life\tsk his road seemed to lie so much on one side of that,
wherein all other travellers have gone before him\tsk he saw kings and courts and
silks of all colours,\catch{in}
in such strange lights\tsh and his remarks\break and reasonings upon the characters, the
manners and customs of the countries we pass’d over, were so opposite to those of
all other mortal men, particularly those of my uncle Toby and Trim\tsk (to say
nothing of myself)\tsk and to crown all\tsk the occurrences and scrapes which we
were perpetually meeting and getting into, in consequence of his systems and
opiniatry\tsk they were of so odd, so mix\-ed and tragicomical a contexture\tsk That
the whole put together, it appears of so different a shade and tint from any tour of
Europe, which was ever executed\tsk That I will venture to pronounce\tsk the fault
must be mine and mine only\tsk if it be not read by all travellers and
travel-readers, till travelling is no more,\tsk or which comes to the same point\tsk
till the\catch{world,}
world, finally, takes it into it’s\sic\ head to stand still.\tsh

\tsh But this rich bale is not to be open’d now;
except a small thread or two of it, merely to unravel the mystery
of my father’s stay at \textsc{Auxerre}.

\tsh As I have mentioned it\tsk ’tis too slight
to be kept suspended; and when ’tis wove in, there’s an end
of it.

We’ll go, brother Toby, said my father, whilst dinner is coddling\tsk to the\break
abby of Saint Germain, if it be only to see these bodies, of which Monsieur Se\-quier has
given such a recommendation.\break
\tsh I’ll go see any body; quoth my uncle Toby; for he
was all compliance thro’ every step of the journey\tsh De-\catch{fend}
fend me! said my father\tsk they are all mummies\tsk Then one need not shave; quoth
my uncle Toby\tsk Shave!  no\tsk\break cried my father\tsk
’twill be more like rela\-tions
to go with our beards on\tsk So out we sallied, the corporal lending his master his
arm, and bringing up the rear, to the abby of Saint Germain.

Every thing is very fine, and very rich, and very superb, and very magnificent, said
my father, addressing himself to the sacristan, who was a younger brother of the
order of Benedictines\tsk but our curi\-osity has led us to see the bodies, of which
monsieur Sequier has given the world so exact a description.\tsk The sacristan made a
bow, and lighting a torch first, which he had always in the vestry ready for the
purpose; he led us into the\catch{tomb}
tomb of St.\@ Heribald\tsh This, said the sacristan,
laying his hand upon the tomb, was a renowned prince of the house of Bavaria, who
under the successive reigns of Charlemagne, Louis le Debonair,\break and Charles the
Bald, bore a great sway in the government, and had a principal hand in bringing
every thing into order and discipline\tsh

Then he has been as great, said my uncle, in the field, as in
the cabinet\tsk I~dare say he has been a gallant
soldier\break\tsh He was a monk\tsk said the sacristan.

My uncle Toby and Trim sought\break comfort in each
other’s faces\tsk but found it not: my father clapp’d both
his hands upon his cod-piece, which was a way he had when any thing
hugely tickled\catch{him;} him; for though he hated a monk and the very smell
of a monk worse than all the devils in hell\tsh Yet the
shot hitting my uncle Toby and Trim so much harder
than him, ’twas a relative triumph; and put him into the
gayest humour in the world.

\tsh And pray what do you call this gentleman? quoth my
father, rather sportingly: This tomb, said the young
Benedictine, looking downwards, contains the bones of Saint
\textsc{Maxima}, who came from Ravenna on purpose to
touch the body\tsh

\tsh Of Saint \textsc{Maximus}, said my fa\-ther, popping in with his saint before
him\break\tsk they were two of the greatest saints in the whole martyrology, added
my father\catch{\tsh Excuse}
\tsh Excuse me, said the sacristan\tsh\break\tsh ’twas to touch the bones
of Saint Germain the builder of the abby\tsh And what did she
get by it? said my uncle Toby\tsh What does any woman get by it?
said my father\tsh \textsc{Martyrdome}; replied the young
Benedictine, making a bow down to the ground, and uttering 
\stick{the word with so humble, but decisive a}
cadence, it disarmed my
father for a mo-\break
\stck{ment. ’Tis supposed, continued the Bene-}\break dictine,
that St.\@ Maxima has lain in this tomb four hundred years, and
two hundred before her canonization\tsh ’Tis but a slow rise,
brother Toby, quoth my father, in this self same army of
martyrs.\break\tsh A desperate slow one, an’ please your honour, said
Trim, unless one could purchase\tsh I should rather sell out
en-\catch{tirely,} tirely, quoth my uncle Toby\tsh I am pretty much of your
opinion, brother Toby, said my father.

\tsh Poor St.\@ Maxima! said my uncle Toby low to himself, as we
turn’d from her tomb: She was one of the fairest and most
beautiful ladies either of Italy or France, continued the
sacristan\break\tsh But who the duce has got lain down here, besides
her, quoth my father, pointing with his cane to a large tomb as
we walked on\tsh It is Saint \textit{Optat}, Sir, answered the
sacristan\tsh And properly is Saint Optat plac’d!\@ said my
father: And what is Saint Optat’s story? continued he. Saint
\textit{Optat}, replied the sacristan,\break was a bishop\tsh\patch{\tsh I}

\tsh I thought so, by heaven! cried 
my father, interrupting him\tsk Saint\break
Optat!\tsh how should Saint \textit{Optat} fail?\break
so snatching out his pocket-book, and the young Benedictine
holding him the torch as he wrote, he set it down as a new prop
to his system of christian names, and I will be bold to say, so
disinterested was he in the search of truth, that had he found a
treasure in Saint Optat’s tomb, it would not have made him half
so rich: ’Twas as successful a short visit as ever was paid to
the dead; and so highly was his fancy pleas’d with all that had
passed in it,\tsk that he determined at once to stay another day
in Auxerre.

\stick{\indent\tsk I’ll see the rest of these good gentry}

I had time to see enough of Lyons to
tire the patience of all the friends I had in the world with it.
I will take a walk to the cathedral, said I, looking at my list,
and see the wonderful mechanism of this great clock of Lippius
of Basil, in\break the first place\tsh

Now, of all things in the world, I
understand the least of mechanism\tsh\break
I have neither genius, or taste, or fancy\break
\tsk and have a brain so entirely unapt for\catch{every}
every
thing of that kind, that I solemnly declare I was never yet able to comprehend the
principles of motion of a squirrel cage, or a common knife-grinder’s wheel\tsk tho’ I
have many an hour of my life look’d up with great devotion at the one\tsk and stood by
with as much patience as any christian ever could do, at the other\tsh

I’ll go see the surprising movements of this great clock, said I, the very first
thing I do: and then I will pay a visit to the great library of the Jesuists\sic, and
procure, if possible, a sight of the thirty volumes of the general history of China,
wrote (not in the Tartarian) but in the Chinese language, and in the Chinese
character too.\patch{Now}

Now I almost know as little of the\break
Chinese language, as I do of the mechanism of
Lippius’s clock-work; so,\break
why these should have jostled themselves into the two
first articles of my list\tsh I leave to the curious as a pro\-blem of Nature.  I own
it looks like one of her ladyship’s obliquities; and they who court her, are
interested in finding out her humour as much as I.

across the room with strides twice as long as my usual pace\tsh

\lqq the sooner shall I be at the \textit{Tomb of the}\break

What was the cause of this movement, and why I took such long
strides in uttering this\tsh I might leave to the curious too;
but as no principle of clock-work is concerned in it\tsh ’twill
be as well for the reader if I explain it myself.

He was eating the stem of an artichoke as this discourse went on, and in the little

\dropcap{N}{o} matter how, or in what
mood\tsk\break but I flew from the tomb of the lovers\tsk or rather I
did not fly \textit{from} it\tsk (for there was no such thing
existing) and just got time enough to the boat to save my
passage;\tsk and e’er I had sailed a hun-\break dred yards, the
Rhône and the Saôn met together, and
carried me down merrily betwixt them.\etp\patch{But}

But I have described this voyage down the Rhône,
before I made it\tsh

\tsh So now I am at Avignion\sic, and as there is
nothing to see but the old house, in which the duke of
Ormond resided, and nothing to stop me but a short remark
upon the place, in three minutes you will see me crossing the
bridge upon a mule, with François upon a horse with
my portmanteau behind him, and the owner of both, striding the way
before 
\stick{us with a long gun upon his shoulder, and}
\stck{a sword under his arm, least peradventure}
\stick{we should run away with his cattle.}
Had you
seen my breeches in entering Avignon,\tsh Though
you’d have seen them better, I think, as I mounted\tsk you
would not have thought the precaution amiss, or found in your heart
to have taken it, in dudgeon; for my own\catch{part,} part, I took it most
kindly; and determined to make him a present of them, when we got
to the end of our journey, for the trouble they had put him to, of
arming himself at all points against them.

Before I go further, let me get rid of my remark upon
Avignon, which is this: That I think it wrong, merely because a man’s
hat has been blown off his head by chance the first night he comes
to Avig\-nion\sic,\tsh that he should therefore say,\break
\lqq Avignion\sic\ is more subject to high winds than any town
in all France:” for which reason I laid no stress upon
the accident till I had enquired of the master of the inn about it,
who telling me seriously it was so\tsh and hearing
moreover, the windyness of Avignion\sic\ spoke of in the country
about as a proverb\tsh I set it down, merely to ask the
learned what can\catch{be} be the cause\tsh the consequence I
saw\tsk for they are all Dukes, Marquisses, and Counts,
there\tsh the duce a Baron, in all
Avignion\sic\tsh so that there is scarce any talking to
them, on a windy day.

Prithee friend, said I, take hold of my
\stick{mule for a moment\tsh for I wanted to}
\stick{pull off one of my jack-boots, which}
\stick{hurt my heel\tsk the man was standing}
\stick{quite idle at the door of the inn, and as I}
\stick{had taken it into my head, he was some-}
\stick{way concerned about the house or stable,}
\stick{I put the bridle into his hand\tsk so be-}
\stick{gun with the boot:\tsk when I had finish-}
\stick{ed the affair, I turned about to take the}
mule from the man, and thank him\tsh

\tsh \textit{But Monsieur le Marquis} had\break
walked in\tsh

\initial{I}{Had} now the whole south of
France, from the banks of the Rhône to those of
the Garonne, to traverse upon my \stck{mule at my own
leisure\tsk \textit{at my own leisure}}\break
\tsh for I had left Death, the Lord knows\break
\tsh and He only\tsk how far behind me\break

mettlesome rate.\,”\tsh Still he follow-\break
ed,\tsh and still I fled him\tsh but I fled him
chearfully\tsh still he pursued\tsh but, like one
who pursued his prey without hope\tsh as he lag’d,
every step he lost, softened his looks\tsh why should I
fly\break him at this rate?

\noindent
\stick{\indent\tight{So notwithstanding all the commissary}}\break 
of the post-office had said, I changed the\catch{\textit{mode}}
\textit{mode} of my travelling once more; and,
after so precipitate and rattling a course as I had run, I
flattered my fancy with thinking of my mule, and that I should
traverse the rich plains of Languedoc upon his back, as
slowly as foot could fall.

There is nothing more pleasing to a traveller\tsh or
more terrible to travel-writers, than a large rich plain;
especi\-ally if it is without great rivers or bridges; and presents
nothing to the eye, but one unvaried picture of plenty: for after
they have once told you, that ’tis delicious! or delightful!
(as the case happens)\tsk that the soil was grateful, and that
nature pours out all her abundance, \etc .\@ .\@ .\@ they
have then a large plain upon their hands, which they know not\catch{what}
what to do with\tsk and which is of little or no use to them but
to carry them to some town; and that town, perhaps of little
more, but a new place to start from to the next plain\tsh and so
on.

\tsh This is most terrible work; judge if I don’t manage
my plains better.

\initial{I}{Had} not gone above two leagues and
a half, before the man with his gun, began to look at his
priming.

I had three several times loiter’d \textit{terribly} behind;
half a mile at least every time: once, in deep conference with a
drum-maker, who was making drums for the fairs of \textit{Baucaira}
and \textit{Tarascone}\tsk I did not understand the
principles\tsh\patch{The}

The second time, I cannot so properly say, I
stopp’d\tsh for meeting a couple of
Franciscans straiten’d more for time than myself, and not
being able to get to the bottom of what I was about\tsh I
had turn’d back with them\tsh

The third, was an affair of trade with a gossip, for a
hand basket of Provence figs for four sous; this would have
been transacted at once; but for a case of conscience at the close
of it; for when the figs were paid for, it turn’d out,
that there were two dozen of eggs cover’d over with
vine-leaves at the bottom of the basket\tsk as I had no intention
of\sic\break of buying eggs\tsk I made no sort of claim of them\tsk as for
the space they had occupied\tsk what signified it? I had figs
enow for my money\tsh\patch{\tsh But}

\tsh But it was my intention to have the basket\tsk it was
the gossip’s intention to keep it, without which, she could
do nothing with her eggs\tsh and unless I had the basket,
I could do as little with my figs, which were too ripe already, and
most of ’em burst at the side: this brought on a short
contention, which terminated in sundry proposals, what we should
both do\tsh

\tsh How we disposed of our eggs and figs, I defy you,
or the Devil himself, had he not been there (which I am persuaded
he was), to form the least probable conjecture: You will read the
whole of it,\break\tsh not this year, for I am hastening to the
story of my uncle Toby’s amours\break
\stick{\tsk but you will read it in the collection of}
\stck{those which have arose out of the journey}\catch{across} 
across this plain\tsk and which, therefore, I call

\centerline{\textsc{Plain Stories}.}

\smallskip

How far my pen has been fatigued like those of other
travellers, in this journey of it, over so barren a track\tsk the
world must judge\tsk but the traces of it, which are now all set
o’ vibrating together this moment, tell me ’tis the
most fruitful and busy period of my life; for as I had made no
convention with my man with the gun as to time\tsk by stopping
and talking to every soul I met who was not in a full
trot\tsk joining all parties before me\tsk waiting for every
soul behind\tsk hailing all those who were coming through
cross roads\tsk arresting all kinds of beggars, pilgrims,
fiddlers, fryars\tsk not passing by a woman in a
mulberry-tree\catch{without}
\stck{without commending her legs, and tempt-}
ing her into conversation
with a pinch of snuff\tsh In short, by seizing every
handle, of what size or shape soever, which chance held out to me
in this journey\tsk I turned my \textit{plain} into a
\textit{city}\tsk I was always in company, and with great variety too; and
as my mule loved society as much as myself, and had some proposals
always on his part to offer to every beast he met\tsk I am
confident we could have passed through Pall-Mall, or St.\@
James’s-Street, for a month together, with fewer
adventures\tsk and seen less of human nature.

O! there is that sprightly frankness, which at once unpins every
plait of a Languedocian’s dress\tsk that whatever is
beneath it, it looks so like the simplicity\catch{which} which poets sing of in
better days\tsk I will delude my fancy, and believe it is so.

’Twas in the road betwixt Nismes and Lunel,
where there is the best Muscatto wine in all France,
and which by the bye belongs to the honest canons of
\textsc{Montpellier}\tsk and foul befall the man who has
drunk it at their table, who grudges them a drop of it.

\tsh The sun was set\tsk they had done their work;
the nymphs had tied up their hair afresh\tsk and the swains were
preparing for a carousal\tsk My mule made a dead point\tsh ’Tis the fife
and tabourin, said I\tsh I’m frighten’d to
death, quoth he\tsh They are running at the ring of
pleasure, said I, giving him a prick\tsh By saint
Boogar, and all the saints at the backside of the door of
pur-\catch{gatory,} gatory, said he\tsk (making the same resolution with the
abbesse of Andoüillets) I’ll not go a step
further\tsh ’Tis very well, sir, said
I\tsh I never will argue a point with one of your family,
as long as\break I live; so leaping off his back, and kicking off one
boot into this ditch, and t’other into that\tsk I’ll
take a dance, said I\tsk so stay you here.

A sun-burnt daughter of Labour rose up from the groupe to meet
me as I\break advanced towards them; her hair, which was a dark
chesnut,
approaching rather to a black, was tied up in a knot, all but a
single tress.

We want a cavalier, said she, holding out both her hands, as if
to offer them\tsk\catch{And}
And a cavalier ye shall have; said I, taking
hold of both of them.

Hadst thou, Nannette, been array’d like a
duchesse!

\tsh But that cursed slit in thy petticoat!

Nannette cared not for it.

We could not have done without you, said she, letting go one
hand, with self-taught politeness, leading me up with the
other.

A lame youth, whom Apollo had\break recompenced with a pipe, and
to which he had added a tabourin of his own accord, ran sweetly
over the prelude, as he sat upon the bank\tsh Tie me up this
tress instantly, said Nannette, putting a piece of string into
my hand\tsk It taught\catch{me} me to forget I was a stranger\tsh The
whole knot fell down\tsh We had been seven years acquainted.

The youth struck the note upon the tabourin\tsk his pipe
followed, and off we bounded\tsh \lqq the duce
take that slit!”

The sister of the youth who had stolen her voice from heaven,
sung alternately with her brother\tsh ’twas a
Gascoigne roundelay.

capriciously did she bend her head on one side, and dance up
