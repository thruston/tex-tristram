I should lament from my soul, if\break

\stick{ideal and local value to a bit of base}
\stick{metal; but Gold and Silver will pass}
\stick{all the world over without any}

own weight.\etp

The same good will that made me\break
\stick{think of offering up half an hour’s}
\stick{amusement to Mr.\@ \astw3 when out of}
\stick{place\tsk operates more forcibly at}
\catch{present,}
\stick{present, as half an hour’s amuse-}
\stick{ment will be more serviceable and} 
\stick{refreshing after labour and sorrow,}
than after a philosophical repast.

Nothing is so perfectly \i{Amuse}-\break 
\stick{\i{ment} as a total change of ideas; no}
\stick{ideas are so totally different as those}
\stick{of Ministers, and innocent Lovers:}
\stick{for which reason, when I come to} 
\stick{talk of Statesmen and Patriots, and} 
\stick{set such marks upon them as will}
\stck{prevent confusion and mistakes con-}
\stick{cerning  them for the future\tsk I pro-}

and chance, which severally check us\break
\stick{in our careers in this world, to bear me}

\stick{to my uncle Toby’s amours, till this}
\stick{very moment, that my mother’s \i{curiosity},}

through the key-hole.

\lqq Call it, my dear, by its right name,\break
\stick{quoth my father, and look through the} 
key-hole as long as you will.”

Nothing but the fermentation of that\break
\stick{little subacid humour, which I have often}
\stick{spoken of, in my father’s habit, could}
\stick{have vented such an insinuation\tsh he} 
\stick{was however frank and generous in his}
\stick{nature, and at all times open to convic-}
\stick{tion; so that he had scarce got to the} 
\stick{last word of this ungracious retort, when}
his conscience smote him.\patch[14pt]{My}

\stick{his right, in such wise, that the inside of}
\stick{her hand rested upon the back of his\tsk}
\stick{she raised her fingers, and let them fall\tsk}
\stick{it could scarce be call’d a tap; or if it}
\stick{was a tap\tsk ’twould have puzzled a}
\stick{casuist to say, whether ’twas a tap of re-}
\stick{monstrance, or a tap of confession: my}
\stck{father, who was all sensibilities from head}
\stick{to foot, class’d it right\tsk Conscience re-}
\stick{doubled her blow\tsk he turn’d his face}
\stick{suddenly the other way, and my mother}
\stick{supposing his body was about to turn}
\stick{with it in order to move homewards,}
\stick{by a cross movement of her right leg,}
\stick{keeping her left as its centre, brought}
\stick{herself so far in front, that as he turned}
\catch{his}
\stick{his head, he met her eye\tsh Confu-}
\stick{sion again! he saw a thousand reasons to} 
\stick{wipe out the reproach, and as many to} 
\stick{reproach himself\tsh a thin, blue, chill,} 
\stick{pellucid chrystal with all its humours so} 
\stick{at rest, the least mote or speck of desire}
\stick{might have been seen at the bottom of} 
\stick{it, had it existed\tsh it did not\tsk\!\tsk and}

\stick{ticularly a little before the vernal and}
\stick{autumnal equinoxes\tsh Heaven above}
\stick{knows\tsh My mother\tsh madam}
\stick{\tsh was so at no time, either by nature,} 
by institution, or example.

A temperate current of blood ran or-\break
\stick{derly through her veins in all months of}
\stick{the year, and in all critical moments both}
\catch{of}
\stick{of the day and night alike; nor did she}
\stick{superinduce the least heat into her hu-}
\stick{mours from the manual effervescencies} 
\stick{of devotional tracts, which having little} 
\stick{or no meaning in them, nature is oft} 
\stick{times obliged to find one\tsh And as for} 
\stick{my father’s example!  ’twas so far from} 
\stick{being either aiding or abetting thereunto,} 
\stick{that ’twas the whole business of his life}
\stick{to keep all fancies of that kind out of}
\stick{her head \tsh Nature had done her part,}
\stck{to have spared him this trouble; and what}
\stick{was not a little inconsistent, my father} 
\stick{knew it\tsh And here am I sitting, this}
\stick{12th day of August, 1766, in a pur-}
\stick{ple jerkin and yellow pair of slippers,} 
\stick{without either wig or cap on, a most}
\catch{tragi-} 
\stick{tragicomical completion of his predic-}
\stick{tion, \lqq That I should neither think,} 
\stick{\lqq nor act like any other man’s child,}
\stick{\lqq upon that very account.”\hfill}

The mistake of my father, was in\break 
\stick{attacking my mother’s motive, instead}
\stick{of the act itself; for certainly key-holes} 
\stick{were made for other purposes; and} 
\stick{considering the act, as an act which}
\stick{interfered with a true proposition, and}
\stick{denied a key-hole to be what it was}
\stick{\tsh it became a violation of nat-}
\stick{ure; and was so far, you see, cri-}
minal.

It is for this reason, an’ please\break
\stick{your Reverences, That key-holes are}
\catch{the}
\stick{the occasions of more sin and wicked-}
\stick{ness, than all other holes in this world}
put together.

\dropcap{T}{hough} the Corporal had\break
been as good as his word in put-\break
\stick{ting my uncle Toby’s great ramallie-wig}
\stick{into pipes, yet the time was too short}
\stick{to produce any great effects from it:} 
\stick{it had lain many years squeezed up in} 
\stick{the corner of his old campaign trunk;}
\stick{and as bad forms are not so easy to be} 
\stick{got the better of, and the use of candle-}
\stick{ends not so well understood, it was} 
\stick{not so pliable a business as one would} 
\stick{have wished. The Corporal with cheary}
\stick{eye and both arms extended, had fallen} 
\stick{back perpendicular from it a score times,}
\stick{to inspire it, if possible, with a better}
\stick{air\tsk had \s{spleen} given a look at it,}
\catch{’twould}
\stick{’twould have cost her ladyship a smile}
\stick{\tsh it curl’d every where but where the}
\stick{Corporal would have it; and where a}
\stick{buckle or two, in his opinion, would}
\stick{have done it honour, he could as soon}
have raised the dead.

Such it was\tsh or rather such would\break
\stick{it have seem’d upon any other brow; but}
\stick{the sweet look of goodness which sat}
\stick{upon my uncle Toby’s, assimulated every}
\stick{thing around it so sovereignly to it-}
\stick{self, and Nature had moreover wrote}
\stick{\s{Gentleman} with so fair a hand in every}
\stick{line of his countenance, that even his}
\stick{tarnish’d gold laced hat and huge cock-}
\stick{ade of flimsy taffeta became him; and}
\stick{though not worth a button in themselves,}
\stick{yet the moment my uncle Toby put}
\stick{them on, they became serious objects,}
\catch{and}
\stck{and altogether seem’d to have been picked} 
\stick{up by the hand of Science to set him off}
to advantage.

Nothing in this world could have co-\break
\stick{operated more powerfully towards this,}
\stick{than my uncle Toby’s blue and gold\tsh}
\stick{\itshape had not Quantity in some measure been ne-} 
\stick{\i{cessary to Grace:} in a period of fifteen or} 
\stick{sixteen years since they had been made,} 
\stick{by a total inactivity in my uncle Toby’s} 
\stick{life, for he seldom went further than the}
\stick{bowling-green\tsk his blue and gold had}
\stick{become so miserably too strait for him,} 
\stick{that it was with the utmost difficulty the} 
\stick{Corporal was able to get him into them:}
\stick{the taking them up at the sleeves, was}
\stick{of no advantage.\tsk\ They were laced} 
\stick{however down the back, and at the seams}
\stick{of the sides, \&c.\@ in the mode of King}
\catch{William’s}
\parskip 10pt
\stick{William’s reign; and to shorten all de-}
\stck{scription, they shone so bright against the}
\stick{sun that morning, and had so metallick,}
\stick{and doughty an air with them, that had}
\stick{my uncle Toby thought of attacking in} 
\stick{armour, nothing could have so well im-}
posed upon his imagination.

As for the thin scarlet breeches, they\break
\stick{had been unripp’d by the taylor between}
the legs, and left at \i{sixes and sevens}\tsh

\tsh Yes, Madam,\tsh but let us go-\break
\stick{vern our fancies. It is enough they}
\stick{were held impracticable the night before,}
\stick{and as there was no alternative in my}
\stick{uncle Toby’s wardrobe, he sallied forth}
in the red plush.

The Corporal had array’d himself in\break
\stick{poor \hbox{Le Fevre’s} regimental coat; and}
\catch{with} 
\stick{with his hair tuck’d up under his Mon-}
\stick{tero cap, which he had furbish’d up} 
\stick{for the occasion, march’d three paces}
\stick{distant from his master: a whiff of mi-}
\stick{litary pride had puff’d out his shirt at}
\stick{the wrist; and upon that in a black lea-}
\stick{ther thong clipp’d into a tassel beyond}
\stick{the knot, hung the Corporal’s stick\tsh}
\stick{My uncle Toby carried his cane like a} 
pike.

\tsh It looks well at least; quoth my\break
father to himself.

\patch[14pt]{\lsss{CHAP}.}

\chap{III}{14pt}{14pt}

\dropcap[findent=2pt]{M}{y} uncle Toby turn’d his head\break
more than once behind him, to\break
\stick{see how he was supported by the Corpo-}
\stick{ral; and the Corporal as oft as he did} 
\stick{it, gave a slight flourish with his stick\tsk} 
\stick{but not vapouringly; and with the sweet-}
\stick{est accent of most respectful encourage-}
ment, bid his honour \lqq never fear.\/”

Now my uncle Toby did fear; and\break
\stick{grievously too; he knew not (as my fa-}
\stick{ther had reproach’d him) so much as the} 
\stick{right end of a Woman from the wrong,} 
\stick{and therefore was never altogether at his}
\stick{ease near any one of them\tsh unless in}
\stick{sorrow or distress; then infinite was his}
\stick{pity; nor would the most courteous}
\catch{knight}
\stick{knight of romance have gone further, at} 
\stick{least upon one leg, to have wiped away} 
\stick{a tear from a woman’s eye; and yet ex-} 
\stick{cepting once that he was beguiled into} 
\stick{it by Mrs.\@ Wadman, he had never looked} 
\stick{stedfastly into one; and would often tell}
\stick{my father in the simplicity of his heart,} 
\stick{that it was almost (if not alout) as bad} 
as talking bawdy.\tsh

\dropcap{W}{hen} Tom, an’ please your ho-\break
nour, got to the shop, there was\break
\stick{nobody in it, but a poor negro girl, with}
\stick{a bunch of white feathers slightly tied to}
\stick{the end of a long cane, flapping away}
\stick{flies\tsk not killing them.\tsh ’Tis a pretty}
\stick{picture! said my uncle Toby\tsk she had}
\stck{suffered persecution, Trim, and had learnt}
mercy\tsh

\tsh She was good, an’ please your\break
\stick{honour, from nature as well as from}
\stick{hardships; and there are circumstances}
\stick{in the story of that poor friendless slut,} 
\stick{that would melt a heart of stone, said} 
\stick{Trim; and some dismal winter’s evening,}
\stick{when your honour is in the humour, they}
\catch{shall} 
\parskip 14pt
\stick{shall be told you with the rest of Tom’s}
\stick{story, for it makes a part of it\tsh}

Then do not forget, Trim, said my\break
uncle Toby.

A Negro has a soul? an’ please your\break
\stick{honour, said the Corporal (doubt-}
ingly).

\tight{I am not much versed, Corporal, quoth}\break
\stick{my uncle Toby, in things of that kind;} 
\stick{but I suppose, God would not leave him} 
\stick{without one, any more than thee or} 
me\tsh

\tsk It would be putting one sadly\break
\stick{over the head of another, quoth the}
Corporal.\patch{It}

It would so; said my uncle Toby.\break
\stick{Why then, an’ please your honour, is a}
\stick{black wench to be used worse than a}
white one?

I can give no reason, said my uncle\break
Toby\tsh

\tsh Only, cried the Corporal, shaking\break
\stick{his head, because she has no one to stand}
up for her\tsh

\tsh ’Tis that very thing, Trim, quoth
\stick{my uncle Toby,\tsh which recommends}
\stick{her to protection\tsh and her brethren}
\stick{with her; ’tis the fortune of war which}
\stick{has put the whip into our hands \i{now}\tsh}
\stick{where it may be hereafter, heaven}
\stick{knows!\tsk but be it where it will,}
\catch{the}
\stick{the brave, Trim! will not use it un-}
kindly.

\tsh God forbid, said the Corporal.

Amen, responded my uncle Toby,\break
laying his hand upon his heart.

The Corporal returned to his story,\break
\stick{and went on\tsh but with an embar-}
\stick{rassment in doing it, which here and} 
\stick{there a reader in this world will not be}
\stick{able to comprehend; for by the many} 
\stick{sudden transitions all along, from one}
\stick{kind and cordial passion to another, in} 
\stick{getting thus far on his way, he had lost}
\stick{the sportable key of his voice which}
\stick{gave sense and spirit to his tale: he} 
\stick{attempted twice to resume it, but could}
\catch{not} 
\stick{not please himself; so giving a stout} 
\stick{hem! to rally back the retreating spirits,} 
\stick{and aiding Nature at the same time with}
\stick{his left arm a-kimbo on one side, and} 
\stick{with his right a little extended, support-}
\stick{ing her on the other\tsk the Corporal got}
\stick{as near the note as he could; and in that}
attitude, continued his story.

\dropcap[findent=0pt]{A}{s} Tom, an’ please your honour,\break
had no business at that time with\break
\stick{the Moorish girl, he passed on into the} 
\stick{room beyond to talk to the Jew’s widow}
\stick{about love\tsh and this pound of saus-}
\stick{ages; and being, as I have told your} 
\stick{honour, an open, cheary hearted lad,} 
\stick{with his character wrote in his looks and} 
\stick{carriage, he took a chair, and without} 
\stick{much apology, but with great civi-}
\stick{lity at the same time, placed it close to} 
her at the table, and sat down.

There is nothing so awkward, as\break
\stick{courting a woman, an’ please your ho-}
\stick{nour, whilst she is making sausages\tsh}
\stick{So Tom began a discourse upon them;}
\catch{first,}
\stick{first, gravely,\tsh \lqq as how they were}
\stick{\lqq made\tsh with what meats, herbs,}
\stick{\lqq and spices”\tsk Then a little gayly\tsk}
\stick{as, \lqq With what skins\tsh and if they}
\stick{\lqq never burst\tsh Whether the largest}
\stick{\lqq were not the best”\tsk and so on\tsk}
\stick{taking care only as he went along, to}
\stick{season what he had to say upon sausages,}
\stick{rather under, than over;\tsh that he} 
might have room to act in\tsh

\tight{It was owing to the neglect of that very}\break
\stick{precaution, said my uncle Toby, laying}
\stick{his hand upon Trim’s shoulder, That}
\stick{Count de la Motte lost the battle of} 
\stick{Wynendale: he pressed too speedily into}
\stick{the wood; which if he had not done,} 
\stick{Lisle had not fallen into our hands, nor} 
\stick{Ghent and Bruges, which both followed}
\catch{her} 
\stick{her example; it was so late in the year,} 
\stick{continued my uncle Toby, and so terrible} 
\stick{a season came on, that if things had not}
\stick{fallen out as they did, our troops must}
have perished in the open field.\tsh

\tsh Why, therefore, may not battles,\break
\stick{an’ please your honour, as well as mar-}
\stick{riages, be made in heaven?\tsk My uncle}
Toby mused.\tsh

Religion inclined him to say one thing,\break
\stick{and his high idea of military skill tempt-}
\stick{ed him to say another; so not being able}
\stick{to frame a reply exactly to his mind}
\stick{\tsh my uncle Toby said nothing at}
\stick{all; and the Corporal finished his}
story.\patch[14pt]{As}
\parskip 8pt

As Tom perceived, an’ please your\break
\stick{honour, that he gained ground, and that}
\stick{all he had said upon the subject of saus-}
\stick{ages was kindly taken, he went on to} 
\stick{help her a little in making them.\tsh}
\stick{First, by taking hold of the ring of} 
\stick{the sausage whilst she stroked the forced}
\stick{meat down with her hand\tsh then by} 
\stick{cutting the strings into proper lengths,} 
\stick{and holding them in his hand, whilst} 
\stick{she took them out one by one\tsh then,}
\stick{by putting them across her mouth, that}
\stick{she might take them out as she wanted}
\stick{them\tsh and so on from little to more,} 
\stick{till at last he adventured to tie the}
\stick{sausage himself, whilst she held the}
snout.\tsh\etp

\tsh Now a widow, an’ please your\break
\stick{honour, always chuses a second husband}
\catch{as} 
\stick{as unlike the first as she can: so the}
\stick{affair was more than half settled in her}
mind before Tom mentioned it.

She made a feint however of defend-\break
\stick{ing herself, by snatching up a sausage:}
\stick{\tsh Tom instantly laid hold of ano-}
ther\tsh

But seeing Tom’s had more gristle in\break
it\tsh

She signed the capitulation\tsh and\break
\stick{Tom sealed it; and there was an end of} 
the matter.

\dropcap[findent=0pt]{A}{ll} womankind, continued Trim,\break
(commenting upon his story) from\break
\stick{the highest to the lowest, an’ please your} 
\stick{honour, love jokes; the difficulty is to}
\stick{know how they chuse to have them cut;}
\stick{and there is no knowing that, but by}
\stick{trying as we do with our artillery in the}
\stick{field, by raising or letting down their}
breeches, till we hit the mark.\tsh

\tsh I like the comparison, said my\break
\stick{uncle Toby, better than the thing it-}
self\tsh

\tsh Because your honour, quoth the\break
\stick{Corporal, loves glory, more than plea-}

I hope, Trim, answered my uncle\break
\stick{Toby, I love mankind more than either;} 
\stick{and as the knowledge of arms tends so}
\stick{apparently to the good and quiet of the}
\stick{world\tsh and particularly that branch} 
\stick{of it which we have practised together}
\stick{in our bowling-green, has no object but} 
\stick{to shorten the strides of \s{Ambition}, and}
\stick{intrench the lives and fortunes of the}
\stick{\i{few}, from the plunderings of the \i{many}}
\stick{\tsh whenever that drum beats in our} 
\stick{ears, I trust, Corporal, we shall neither of}
\stick{us want so much humanity and fellow-}
feeling as to face about and march.

In pronouncing this, my uncle Toby\break
\stick{faced about, and march’d firmly as at} 
\stick{the head of his company\tsh and the} 
\stick{faithful Corporal, shouldering his stick,}
\catch{and}
\stick{and striking his hand upon his coat-skirt} 
\stick{as he took his first step\tsh march’d}
\stick{close behind him down the avenue.\hfill}

\tsh Now what can their two noddles\break
\stick{be about? cried my father to my mother}
\stick{\tsh by all that’s strange, they are be-}
\stick{sieging Mrs.\@ Wadman in form, and are}
\stick{marching round her house to mark out} 
the lines of circumvallation.

I dare say, quoth my mother\tsh\break
\stick{\tsk But stop, dear Sir\tsk for what}
\stck{my mother dared to say upon the occasion}
\stick{\tsh and what my father did say upon} 
\stick{it\tsh with her replies and his rejoinders,}

\stick{done more than the Legation of Moses,}
\stick{or the Tale of a Tub, that it may not}

with them?

I will not argue the matter: Time\break

\dropcap[findent=2pt]{M}{y} mother had gone with her left\break
arm twisted in my father’s right,\break
\stick{till they had got to the fatal angle of the}
\stick{old garden wall, where Doctor Slop was}
\stick{overthrown by Obadiah on the coach-}
\stick{horse: as this was directly opposite to} 
\stick{the front of Mrs.\@ Wadman’s house,} 
\stick{when my father came to it, he gave a}

The Corporal was just then setting in\break

When issues of events like these my\break

would not have power to see it out.

Curiosity governs the \i{first moment};\break
\stick{and the second moment is all œconomy} 
\stick{to justify the expence of the first\tsh}
\stick{and for the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth} 
\stick{moments, and so on to the day of judg-}
ment\tsk ’tis a point of \s{Honour}.

\tight{I need not be told, that the ethic writers}\break
\stick{have assigned this all to Patience; but}

\stick{dominion sufficient of her own, and}
\stick{enough to do in it, without invading the}
\catch{few} 
\stk{few dismantled castles which \s{Honour} has} 
left him upon the earth.

My father stood it out as well as he\break
\stick{could with these three auxiliaries to the}
\stick{end of Trim’s story; and from thence to}
\stick{the end of my uncle Toby’s panegyrick} 
\stick{upon arms, in the chapter following it;}

\dropcap{U}{pon} looking back from the end\break 
of the last chapter and surveying\break
\stick{the texture of what has been wrote, it is} 
\stick{necessary, that upon this page and the}
\stick{five following, a good quantity of hete-}
\stick{rogeneous matter be inserted, to keep up} 
\stick{that just balance betwixt wisdom and} 
\stick{folly, without which a book would not}
\stick{hold together a single year: nor is it a} 
\stick{poor creeping digression (which but for} 
\stick{the name of, a man might continue as} 
\stick{well going on in the king’s highway)} 
\stick{which will do the business\tsh no; if it} 
\stick{is to be a digression, it must be a good} 
\stick{frisky one, and upon a frisky subject too,} 
\stick{where neither the horse or his rider are} 
to be caught, but by rebound.\patch{The}

The only difficulty, is raising powers\break
\stick{suitable to the nature of the service:}
\stick{\s{Fancy} is capricious\tsk \s{Wit} must not be}
\stick{searched for\tsk and \s{Pleasantry} (good-}
\stick{natured slut as she is) will not come in} 
\stick{at a call, was an empire to be laid at her}
feet.

\tsh The best way for a man, is to\break
say his prayers\tsh

Only if it puts him in mind of his in-\break
\stick{firmities and defects as well ghostly as} 
\stick{bodily\tsk for that purpose, he will find} 
\stick{himself rather worse after he has said}
\stick{them than before\tsk for other purposes,}
better.

For my own part there is not a way\break
\stick{either moral or mechanical under heaven}
\catch{that} 
\stick{that I could think of, which I have not}
\stick{taken with myself in this case: some-}
\stick{times by addressing myself directly to th\lower.25ex\hbox{e}\sic}
\stick{soul herself, and arguing the point over} 
\stick{and over again with her upon the extent}
of her own faculties\tsh

\tsh I never could make them an inch\break
the wider\tsh

Then by changing my system, and\break
\stick{trying what could be made of it upon}
\stick{the body, by temperance, soberness and}
\stck{chastity: These are good, quoth I, in them-}
\stick{selves\tsk they are good, absolutely;\tsk they}
\stick{are good, relatively;\tsk they are good for}
\stick{health\tsk they are good for happiness in} 
\stick{this world\tsk they are good for happiness} 
in the next\tsh\patch{In}
\baselineskip 13.3333pt

In short, they were good for every\break
\stick{thing but the thing wanted; and there}
\stick{they were good for nothing, but to leave}
\stick{the soul just as heaven made it: as for} 
\stick{the theological virtues of faith and hope,}
\stick{they give it courage; but then that snive-}
\stick{ling virtue of Meekness (as my father} 
\stick{would always call it) takes it quite away}
\stick{again, so you are exactly where you} 
started.

\tight{Now in all common and ordinary cases,}\break
\stick{there is nothing which I have found to} 
answer so well as this\tsh

\tsh Certainly, if there is any depend-\break
\stick{ence upon Logic, and that I am not}
\stick{blinded by self-love, there must be}
\stick{something of true genius about me,}
\stick{merely upon this symptom of it, that I}
\stick{do not know what envy is: for never do}
\catch{I hit} 
\stick{I hit upon any invention or device which}
\stick{tendeth to the furtherance of good writ-}

\tsh I never stand conferring with pen\break

\stick{will not do the business for me\tsk I take a}

\tsh I maintain it, the conceits of a\break
\stck{rough-bearded man, are seven years more}
\stick{terse and juvenile for one single opera-}
\stick{tion; and if they did not run a risk of}

\stick{presented to his imagination, genteelized} 
\stick{along with him\tsk so that he has nothing}
\stick{to do, but take his pen, and write like} 
himself.

For this cause, when your honours\break

\stick{ready for it\tsh I could write my chapter}
of Button-holes in it\tsh

Or my chapter of \i{Pishes}, which should\break
follow them\tsh

Or my chapter of \i{Knots}, in case their\break
\stick{reverences have done with them\tsh}
\stick{they might lead me into mischief: the}
\stick{safest way is to follow the tract of the}
\catch{learned,} 
\stck{learned, and raise objections against what} 
\stick{I have been writing, tho’ I declare before-}
\stick{hand, I know no more than my heels} 
how to answer them.

And first, it may be said, there is a\break
\stick{pelting kind of \i{thersitical} satire, as black}
\stick{as the very ink ’tis wrote with\tsh (and} 
\stick{by the bye, whoever says so, is indebted} 
\stick{to the muster-master general of the Gre-}
\stick{cian army, for suffering the name of}
\stick{so ugly and foul-mouth’d a man as}
\stick{\i{Thersites} to continue upon his roll\tsh}
\stick{for it has furnish’d him with an epithet)}
\stick{\tsh in these productions he will urge,} 
\stick{all the personal washings and scrubbings}
\stick{upon earth do a sinking genius no sort}
\stick{of good\tsh but just the contrary, inas-}
\catch{much}
\stick{much as the dirtier the fellow is, the}
better generally he succeeds in it.

To this, I have no other answer\tsh\break
\stick{at least ready\tsk\!\tsk but that the Arch-}
\stick{bishop of Benevento wrote his \i{nasty} Ro-}
\stick{mance of the Galatea, as all the world}
\stick{knows, in a purple coat, waistcoat, and}
\stick{purple pair of breeches; and that the}
\stick{penance set him of writing a commen-}
\stick{tary upon the book of the Revelations,}
\stick{as severe as it was look’d upon by one}
\stick{part of the world, was far from being}
\stick{deem’d so, by the other, upon the single}
account of that \i{Investment}.

Another objection, to all this remedy,\break
\stick{is its want of universality; forasmuch as} 
\stick{the shaving part of it, upon which so}
\catch{much}
\stick{much stress is laid, by an unalterable law}
\stick{of nature excludes one half of the spe-}
\stick{cies entirely from its use: all I can say is,}
\stick{that female writers, whether of England,}
\stick{or of France, must e’en go without}
it\tsh

As for the Spanish ladies\tsh I am in no sort of
distress\tsh

\catch{were} 
\stick{were rough or smooth, it made no dif-}
\stick{ference; every thing I saw, or had to do}
\stick{with, touch’d upon some secret spring}
either of sentiment or rapture.

\tsh They were the sweetest notes I\break
\stick{ever heard; and I instantly let down the}

\stick{\tsh ’Tis Maria; said the postillion,}
\stick{observing I was listening\tsh Poor}
\stick{Maria, continued he, (leaning his body} 
\stick{on one side to let me see her, for he was}
\stick{in a line betwixt us) is sitting upon a} 
\stick{bank playing her vespers upon her pipe,} 
with her little goat beside her.

The young fellow utter’d this with an\break
\stick{accent and a look so perfectly in tune to}
\stick{a feeling heart, that I instantly made a}
\catch{vow,}
\stick{vow, I would give him a four and}
\stick{twenty sous piece, when I got to}
\i{Moulins}\tsh

\tsh And who is \i{poor Maria\;?}\break
said~I.

The love and pity of all the villages\break
\stick{around us; said the postillion\tsh it is}
\stick{but three years ago, that the sun did not}
\stick{shine upon so fair, so quick-witted and} 
\stick{amiable a maid; and better fate did} 
\stick{\i{Maria} deserve, than to have her Banns}
\stick{forbid, by the intrigues of the curate of} 
the parish who published them\tsh

He was going on, when Maria, who\break
\stick{had made a short pause, put the pipe} 
\stick{to her mouth and began the air again}
\catch{\tsk\!\tsk they}
\stick{\tsh they were the same notes;\tsh yet}
\stick{were ten times sweeter: It is the evening}
\stick{service to the Virgin, said the young}
\stick{man\tsh but who has taught her to} 
\stick{play it\tsk or how she came by her pipe,} 
\stick{no one knows; we think that Heaven has} 
\stick{assisted her in both; for ever since she}
\stick{has been unsettled in her mind, it seems} 
\stick{her only consolation\tsh she has never} 
\stick{once had the pipe out of her hand, but} 
\stick{plays that \i{service} upon it almost night}
and day.

The postillion delivered this with so\break
\stick{much discretion and natural eloquence,} 
\stick{that I could not help decyphering some-}
\stick{thing in his face above his condition,} 
\stick{and should have sifted out his history,}
\catch{had} 
\stick{had not poor Maria's taken such full}
possession of me.

We had got up by this time almost\break

\stick{was beautiful; and if ever I felt the full}
\stick{force of an honest heart-ache, it was the}
moment I saw her\tsh

\stick{above a hundred masses, said the postil-}

before the Corporal had well given\break
\stick{the rap, the interval betwixt that and}
\stick{my uncle Toby’s introduction into the}
\stick{parlour, was so short, that Mrs.\@ Wad-}
\stick{man had but just time to get from be-}
\stick{hind the curtain\tsh lay a Bible upon}
\stick{the table, and advance a step or two to-}
wards the door to receive him.

My uncle Toby saluted Mrs.\@ Wad-\break
\stick{man, after the manner in which women}
\stick{were saluted by men in the year of our}
\stick{Lord God one thousand seven hundred}
\stick{and thirteen\tsk then facing about,}
\stick{he march’d up abreast with her to the}
\catch{sopha,}

\stick{though not before he was sat down\tsh}
\stick{nor after he was sat down\tsk}
\stick{but as he was sitting down, told her,} 
\stick{\lqq \i{he was in love}”\tsh so that my uncle}
\stick{Toby strained himself more in the de-}
claration than he needed.

Mrs.\@ Wadman naturally looked down,\break
\stick{upon a slit she had been darning up in} 
\stick{her apron, in expectation every moment,}
\stick{that my uncle Toby would go on; but} 
\stick{having no talents for amplification, and}
\stick{\s{Love} moreover of all others being a}
\stick{subject of which he was the least a mas-}
\stick{ter\tsh When he had told  Mrs.\@ Wad-}
\stick{man once that he loved her, he let it} 
\stick{alone, and left the matter to work after}
its own way.\patch{My}

My father was always in raptures with\break
\stick{this system of my uncle Toby’s, as he} 
\stick{falsely called it, and would often say, that}
\stick{could his brother Toby to his processe} 
\stick{have added but a pipe of tobacco\tsh} 
\stick{he had wherewithal to have found his}
\stick{way, if there was faith in a Spanish pro-}
\stick{verb, towards the hearts of half the}
women upon the globe.

My uncle Toby never understood\break
\stick{what my father meant; nor will I pre-}
\stick{sume to extract more from it, than a}
\stick{condemnation of an error which the}
\stick{bulk of the world lie under\tsh but the}
\stick{French, every one of ’em to a man,}
\stick{who believe in it, almost as much as}
\stick{the \s{real presence}, \lqq \i{That talking of}} 
\lqq \i{love, is making it}.\,”\patch{\tsh I}

\tsh I would as soon set about\break
\stick{making a black-pudding by the same\break}
receipt.

Let us go on: Mrs.\@ Wadman sat in\break
\stick{expectation my uncle Toby would do so,} 
\stick{to almost the first pulsation of that mi-}
\stick{nute, wherein silence on one side or}
\stck{the other, generally becomes indecent: so} 
\stick{edging herself a little more towards him,}
\stick{and raising up her eyes, sub-blushing, as}
\stick{she did it\tsh she took up the gauntlet}
\stick{\tsh or the discourse (if you like it bet-}
\stick{ter) and communed with my uncle} 
Toby, thus.

The cares and disquietudes of the\break
\stick{marriage state, quoth Mrs.\@ Wadman,}
\catch{are} 
\stick{are very great. I suppose so\tsk said my}
\stick{uncle Toby: and therefore when a per-}
\stick{son, continued Mrs.\@ Wadman, is so much}
\stick{at his ease as you are\tsk so happy, captain}
\stick{Shandy, in yourself, your friends and} 
\stick{your amusements\tsk I wonder, what rea-}
sons can incline you to the state\tsh

\tsh They are written, quoth my un-
\stick{cle Toby, in the Common-Prayer Book.}

Thus far my uncle Toby went on\break
\stick{warily, and kept within his depth, leav-}
\stick{ing Mrs.\@ Wadman to sail upon the gulph}
as she pleased.

\tsk As for children\tsk said Mrs.\@ Wad-\break
\stick{man\tsk though a principal end perhaps of} 
\stck{the institution, and the natural wish, I sup-}
\stick{pose, of every parent\tsk yet do not we all}

\stick{Toby, smit with pity, I know of none;} 
\stick{unless it be the pleasure which it has}

\stick{\tsk That Casuists (for it is an affair of}
\stick{conscience on that score) reckon up no} 
\stick{less than fourteen thousand in which you}

Mrs.\@ Wadman hit upon the \i{fiddlestick},\break

\stick{modest blood into his cheeks\tsk so feeling}
\stick{within himself that he had somehow or}

\stick{into the pains or pleasures of matrimony,} 
\stick{he laid his hand upon his heart, and made}
\stick{an offer to take them as they were, and}
share them along with her.

When my uncle Toby had said this,\break
\stick{he did not care to say it again; so cast-}
\stick{ing his eye upon the Bible which  Mrs.}
\stick{Wadman had laid upon the table, he}
\stick{took it up; and popping, dear soul!}

\stick{drug which nature had bestowed upon}

\dropcap{I}{t} is natural for a perfect stranger\break

It was just as natural for Mrs.\@ Wad-\break

\stick{know how far from the hip to the groin;}
\stick{and how far she was likely to suffer}

Doctor Slop was the worst man alive\break

\stick{could get no knowledge: in short, there}
\stick{was no way to extract it, but from my}
uncle Toby himself.

\stick{got his wound before the gate of St.}
\stick{Nicolas, in one of the traverses of the}

\stick{the demi-bastion of St.\@ Roch; he could} 
\stick{at any time stick a pin upon the identical} 
\stick{spot of ground where he was standing} 
\stick{when the stone struck him: this struck} 
\stick{instantly upon my uncle Toby’s senso-}

My uncle Toby measured off thirty\break
\stick{toises, with  Mrs.\@ Wadman’s scissars,}
\stick{from the returning angle before the gate}
\stick{of St.\@ Nicolas; and with such a virgin} 
\stick{modesty laid her finger upon the place,}

\stick{Trim, a thousand fold, she could not}
\stick{make more constant or more tender en-}
\stick{quiries after my sufferings\tsh though}
now no more.

The Corporal made no reply to my\break
\stick{uncle Toby’s protestation, but by a short}
\stick{cough \tsk he dip’d the pen a second time} 
\stick{into the inkhorn; and my uncle Toby,} 
\stick{pointing with the end of his pipe as close}
\stick{to the top of the sheet at the left hand}
\stick{corner of it, as he could get it\tsh the} 
\stick{Corporal wrote down the word\hfill}
\stick{{\addfontfeature{LetterSpace=36}HUMANITY} - - - - thus.}
\patch{Prithee,}

Prithee, Corporal, said my uncle Toby,\break
\stick{as soon as Trim had done it\tsh how} 
\stick{often does Mrs.\@ Bridget enquire after}
\stick{the wound on the cap of thy knee,}
\stick{which thou received’st at the battle of}
Landen?

She never, an’ please your honour,\break 
enquires after it at all.

That, Corporal, said my uncle Toby,\break
\stick{with all the triumph the goodness of his}
\stick{nature would permit\tsh That shews}
\stick{the difference in the character of the}
\stick{mistress and maid\tsh had the fortune} 
\stick{of war allotted the same mischance to}
\stick{me, Mrs.\@ Wadman would have enquired} 
\stick{into every circumstance relating to it a}
\catch{hundred}
\stick{hundred times\tsh She would have en-}
\stick{quired, an’ please your honour, ten times}
\stick{as often about your honour’s groin\tsh}
\stick{The pain, Trim, is equally excruciating,}
\stick{\tsh and Compassion has as much to do} 
with the one as the other\tsh

\tsh God bless your honour! cried\break
\stick{the Corporal\tsh what has a woman’s} 
\stick{compassion to do with a wound upon} 
\stick{the cap of a man’s knee? had your ho-}
\stick{nour’s been shot into ten thousand} 
\stick{splinters at the affair of Landen, Mrs.}
\stick{Wadman would have troubled her head}
\stick{as little about it as Bridget; because,}
\stick{added the Corporal, lowering his voice}
\stick{and speaking very distinctly, as he}
assigned his reason\tsh\patch{\lqq The}

\lqq The knee is such a distance from\break
\stick{\lqq the main body\tsh whereas the groin,}
\stick{\lqq your honour knows, is upon the very}
\stick{\lqq \i{curtin} of the \i{place}.\,”\hfill}

My uncle Toby gave a long whistle\break
\stick{\tsh but in a note which could scarce be} 
heard across the table.

The Corporal had advanced too far\break
\stick{to retire\tsh in three words he told the} 
rest\tsh

My uncle Toby laid down his pipe\break
\stick{as gently upon the fender, as if it had}
\stick{been spun from the unravellings of a}
spider’s web\tsh

\tsh Let us go to my brother\break 
Shandy’s, said he.

\dropcap{T}{here} will be just time, whilst\break 
my uncle Toby and Trim are\break
\stick{walking to my father’s, to inform you,}
\stick{that Mrs.\@ Wadman had, some moons}
\stick{before this, made a confident of my mo-}
\stick{ther; and that Mrs.\@ Bridget, who had} 
\stick{the burden of her own, as well as her}
\stick{mistress’s secret to carry, had got hap-}
\stick{pily delivered of both to Susannah be-}
hind the garden-wall.

As for my mother, she saw nothing\break
\stick{at all in it, to make the least bustle about}
\stick{\tsh but Susannah was sufficient by her-}
\stick{self for all the ends and purposes you} 
\stick{could possibly have, in exporting a fa-}
\catch{mily}
\stick{mily secret; for she instantly imparted it}
\stick{by signs to Jonathan\tsh and Jonathan} 
\stick{by tokens to the cook, as she was bast-}
\stick{ing a loin of mutton; the cook sold it}
\stick{with some kitchen-fat to the postillion}
\stick{for a groat, who truck’d it with the}
\stick{dairy maid for something of about the}
\stick{same value\tsk and though whisper’d}
\stick{in the hay-loft, \s{Fame} caught the notes}
\stick{with her brazen trumpet and sounded} 
\stick{them upon the house-top\tsk In a word,}
\stick{not an old woman in the village or five} 
\stick{miles round, who did not understand} 
\stick{the difficulties of my uncle Toby’s siege,}
\stick{and what were the secret articles which} 
had delay’d the surrender.\tsh

My father, whose way was to force\break
\stick{every event in nature into an hypothesis,}
\catch{by} 
\stick{by which means never man crucified} 
\stick{\s{Truth} at the rate he did\tsh had but}
\stick{just heard of the report as my uncle}
\stick{Toby set out; and catching fire suddenly}
\stick{at the trespass done his brother by it, was}
\stick{demonstrating to Yorick, notwithstand-}
\stick{ing my mother was sitting by\tsh not}
\stick{only, \lqq That the devil was in women,}
\stick{\lqq and that the whole of the affair was}

\stick{der in the world of what kind or nature}
\stick{soever, from the first fall of Adam,} 
\stick{down to my uncle Toby’s (inclusive)}
\stick{was owing one way or other to the same}
unruly appetite.

Yorick was just bringing my father’s\break
\stick{hypothesis to some temper, when my un-}
\stick{cle Toby entering the room with marks}
\catch{of}
\stck{of infinite benevolence and forgiveness in}
\stick{his looks, my father’s eloquence re-}

\stick{was not very nice in the choice of his}
\stick{words when he was wroth\tsh as soon as} 
\stick{my uncle Toby was seated by the fire,} 
\stick{and had filled his pipe, my father broke}
out in this manner.

\stick{that in itself, and simply taken\tsh like}

\stick{ents\tsk the preparations\tsk the instruments,}
\stick{and whatever serves thereto, are so held}

whatever?

\tsh The act of killing and destroying\break

\catch{you}

\tsh My uncle Toby laid down his\break
\stick{pipe to intercede for a better epithet\tsk}
\stick{and Yorick was rising up to batter the}
whole hypothesis to pieces\tsh

\tsh When Obadiah broke into the\break
\stick{middle of the room with a complaint,} 
\stick{which cried out for an immediate hear-}
ing.

The case was this:\patch{My}

My father, whether by ancient cus-\break
\stick{tom of the manor, or as improprietor of} 
\stick{the great tythes, was obliged to keep a}
\stick{Bull for the service of the Parish, and} 
\stick{Obadiah had led his cow upon a \i{pop}-}
\stick{\i{visit} to him one day or other the pre-}
\stick{ceding summer\tsh I say, one day or} 
\stick{other\tsk because as chance would have it,}
\stick{it was the day on which he was married} 
\stick{to my father’s house-maid\tsk so one}
\stick{was a reckoning to the other. There-}
\stick{fore when Obadiah’s wife was brought to}
bed\tsk Obadiah thanked God\tsh

\tsh Now, said Obadiah, I shall have\break
\stick{a calf: so Obadiah went daily to visit his}
cow.\patch{She’ll}

\topstrut She’ll calve on Monday\tsk on Tuesday\break
\tsk or Wednesday at the farthest\tsh

The cow did not calve\tsh no\tsk she’ll\break
\stick{not calve till next week\tsh the cow put} 
\stick{it off terribly\tsk till at the end of the} 
\stick{sixth week Obadiah’s suspicions (like a}
good man’s) fell upon the Bull.

Now the parish being very large, my\break
\stick{father’s Bull, to speak the truth of him,} 
\stick{was no way equal to the department; he}
\stick{had, however, got himself, somehow} 
\stick{or other, thrust into employment\tsk and as} 
\stck{he went through the business with a grave}
\stick{face, my father had a high opinion of}
him.\patch{\tsh Most}

\tsh Most of the townsmen, an’\break
\stick{please your worship, quoth Obadiah, be-}
lieve that ’tis all the Bull’s fault\tsh

\tsh But may not a cow be barren?\break
\stick{replied my father, turning to Doctor}
Slop.

It never happens: said Dr.\@ Slop, but\break
\stick{the man’s wife may have come before}
\stick{her time naturally enough\tsh Prithee}
\stick{has the child hair upon his head?\tsk ad-}
ded Dr.\@ Slop\tsh

\tsh It is as hairy as I am; said Oba-\break

\stick{Bull as ever p—ss’d, and might have} 
\stick{done for Europa herself in purer times}
\stick{\tsh had he but two legs less, might}
\stick{have been driven into Doctors Commons} 
\stick{and lost his character\tsh which to a}
