The London waggon confirmed me in\break

Shall we for ever make new books, as\break
\stick{apothecaries make new mixtures, by}

another?

Are we for ever to be twisting, and\break

Shall we be destined to the days of\break

\stick{\ast\ \ast\tsh You are half asleep, my good}
\stick{lady, said the old gentleman, taking}
\stick{hold of the old lady’s hand and giving}
\stick{it a gentle squeeze, as he pronounced}
\stick{the word \textit{Whiskers}\tsh shall we change}
\stick{the subject? By no means, replied the}
\stick{old lady\tsk I like your account of these}
\stick{matters: so throwing a thin gauze}
\stick{handkerchief over her head, and leaning}
\stick{it back upon the chair with her face}
\stick{turned towards him, and advancing her}
\stick{two feet as she reclined herself\tsk I desire,}
continued she, you will go on.

The old gentleman went on as follows.\break
\stick{\tsh Whiskers! cried the queen of}
\stick{\textit{Navarre}, dropping her knotting-ball, as}
\stick{\textit{La Fosseuse} uttered the word\tsh Whis-}\catch{kers;} 
\stick{kers; madam, said \textit{La Fosseuse}, pinning} 
\stick{the ball to the queen’s apron, and mak-}
ing a courtesy as she repeated it.

\textit{La Fosseuse}’s voice was naturally soft\break
\stick{and low, yet ’twas an articulate voice:}
\stick{and every letter of the word \textit{whiskers} fell} 
\stick{distinctly upon the queen of \textit{Navarre}’s} 
\stick{ear\tsk Whiskers! cried the queen, laying}
\stick{a greater stress upon the word, and as if}
\stick{she had still distrusted her ears\tsk Whis-}
\stick{kers; replied \textit{La Fosseuse}, repeating the}
\stick{word a third time\tsk There is not a cava-}
\stick{lier, madam, of his age in \textit{Navarre}, con-}
\stick{tinued the maid of honour, pressing the}
\stick{page’s interest upon the queen, that has}
\stick{so gallant a pair\tsk Of what? cried \textit{Mar}-}
\stick{\textit{garet}, smiling\tsh Of whiskers, said \textit{La}}
\textit{Fosseuse}, with infinite modesty.\patch{The}

The word whiskers still stood its\break
\stick{ground, and continued to be made use}
\stick{of in most of the best companies through-}
\stick{out the little kingdom of \textit{Navarre}, not-}
\stick{withstanding the indiscreet use which \textit{La}}
\stick{\textit{Fosseuse} had made of it: the truth was,}
\stick{\textit{La Fosseuse} had pronounced the word,} 
\stick{not only before the queen, but upon sun-}
\stick{dry other occasions at court, with an ac-}
\stick{cent which always implied something of} 
\stick{a mystery\tsh And as the court of \textit{Mar}-}
\stick{\textit{garet}, as all the world knows, was at}
\stick{that time a mixture of gallantry and de-}
\stick{votion\tsh and whiskers being as appli-}
\stick{cable to the one, as the other, the word} 
\stick{naturally stood its ground\tsk it gain’d full}
\stick{as much as it lost; that is, the clergy}
\stick{were for it\tsk the laity were against it\tsk}
\stick{and for the women,\tsh \textit{they} were di-}
vided.\tsh\patch{The}

The excellency of the figure and mien\break
\stick{of the young Sieur \textit{de Croix}, was at that}
\stick{time beginning to draw the attention of} 
\stick{the maids of honour towards the terras}
\stick{before the palace gate, where the guard} 
\stick{was mounted. The Lady \textit{de Baussiere}}
\stick{fell deeply in love with him,\tsh \textit{La Batta}-}
\stick{\textit{relle} did the same\tsk it was the finest wea-}
\stick{ther for it, that ever was remembered in}
\stick{\textit{Navarre}\tsk \textit{La Guyol}, \textit{La Maronette}, \textit{La}}
\stick{\textit{Sabatiere}, fell in love with the Sieur \textit{de}}
\stick{\textit{Croix} also\tsk \textit{La Rebours} and \textit{La Fosseuse}} 
\stick{knew better\tsk \textit{De Croix} had failed in an} 
\stick{attempt to recommend himself to \textit{La}}
\stick{\textit{Rebours}; and \textit{La Rebours} and \textit{La Fosseuse}}
were inseparable.

The queen of \textit{Navarre} was sitting with\break
\stick{her ladies in the painted bow-window,} 
\stick{facing the gate of the second court, as}
\stick{\textit{De Croix} passed through it\tsk He is hand-}\catch{some,}
\stick{some, said the Lady \textit{Baussiere}.\tsk He has a} 
\stick{good mien, said \textit{La Battarelle}.\tsk He is}
\stick{finely shaped, said \textit{La Guyol}.\tsk I never} 
\stick{saw an officer of the horse-guards in my}
\stick{life, said \textit{La Maronette}, with two such} 
\stick{legs\tsk Or who stood so well upon them,} 
\stick{said \textit{La Sabatiere}\tsh But he has no whis-}
\stick{kers, cried \textit{La Fosseuse}\tsk Not a pile, said}
\textit{La Rebours}.

The queen went directly to her ora-
\stick{tory, musing all the way, as she walked} 
\stick{through the gallery, upon the subject;} 
\stick{turning it this way and that way in her}
\stick{fancy\tsh\textit{Ave Maria}\,✝︎\tsk what can \textit{La}}
\stick{\textit{Fosseuse} mean? said she, kneeling down} 
upon the cushion.

\textit{La Guyol}, \textit{La Battarelle}, \textit{La Maronette},\break
\stick{\textit{La Sabatiere}, retired instantly to their}
\stick{\stick{chambers\tsk Whiskers! said all four of}}\catch{them}
\stick{them to themselves, as they bolted their} 
doors on the inside.

The Lady \textit{Carnavallette} was counting\break
\stick{her beads with both hands, unsuspected,} 
\stick{under her farthingal\tsh from St.\@ \textit{Antony}}
\stick{down to St.\@ \textit{Ursula} inclusive, not a saint}
\stick{passed through her fingers without whis-}
\stick{kers; St.\@ \textit{Francis}, St.\@ \textit{Dominick}, St.\@ \textit{Ben}-}
\stick{\textit{net}, St.\@ \textit{Basil}, St.\@ \textit{Bridget}, had all whis-}
kers.

The Lady \textit{Baussiere} had got into a\break 
\stick{wilderness of conceits, with moralizing} 
\stick{too intricately upon \textit{La Fosseuse}’s text\tsk}
\stick{She mounted her palfry, her page fol-}
\stick{lowed her\tsk the host passed by\tsk the lady}
\textit{Baussiere} rode on.

One denier, cried the order of mercy\break
\stick{\tsk one single denier, in behalf of a thou-}\catch{sand}
\stick{sand patient captives, whose eyes look}
\stick{towards heaven and you for their re-}
demption.

\tsh The Lady \textit{Baussiere} rode on.

Pity the unhappy, said a devout, ve-\break
\stck{nerable, hoary-headed man, meekly hold-}
\stick{ing up a box, begirt with iron, in his}
\stick{withered hands\tsh I beg for the unfor-}
\stick{tunate\tsk good, my lady, ’tis for a prison}
\stick{\tsk for an hospital\tsk ’tis for an old man\tsk}
\stick{a poor man undone by shipwreck, by}

\stick{his angels to witness\tsk ’tis to cloath the}
\stick{naked\tsk to feed the hungry\tsk ’tis to com-}
fort the sick and the broken hearted.

\tsh The Lady \textit{Baussiere} rode on.

A decayed kinsman bowed himself to\break

\tsh The Lady \textit{Baussiere} rode on.

He ran begging bare-headed on one\break
\stick{side of her palfry, conjuring her by the}
\stick{former bonds of friendship, alliance, con-}
\stick{sanguinity, \et\textit{c}.\tsk Cousin, aunt, sister, mo-}
\stick{ther\tsk for virtue’s sake, for your own, for}
\stick{mine, for Christ’s sake remember me\tsk}
pity me.

\tsh  The Lady \textit{Baussiere} rode on.

Take hold of my whiskers, said the\break
\stick{Lady \textit{Baussiere}\tsh The page took hold} 
\stick{of her palfry. She dismounted at the}
end of the terrace.

There are some trains of certain ideas\break
\stick{which leave prints of themselves about} 
\stick{our eyes and eye-brows; and there is a}
\stick{consciousness of it, somewhere about the}\catch{heart,} 
\stick{heart, which serves but to make these} 
\stick{etchings the stronger\tsk we see, spell, and} 
put them together without a dictionary.

Ha, ha! hee, hee! cried \textit{La Guyol} and\break
\stick{\textit{La Sabatiere}, looking close at each others}
\stick{prints\tsh Ho, ho! cried \textit{La Battarelle}} 
\stick{and \textit{Maronette}, doing the same:\tsk Whist!}
\stick{cried one\tsk st, st,\tsk said a second,\tsk hush,} 
\stick{quoth a third\tsk poo, poo, replied a}
\stick{fourth\tsk gramercy! cried the Lady \textit{Car}-}
\stick{\textit{navallette};\tsk ’twas she who bewhisker’d} 
St.\@ \textit{Bridget}.

\textit{La Fosseuse} drew her bodkin from the\break
\stick{knot of her hair, and having traced the}
\stick{outline of a small whisker, with the blunt}
\stick{end of it, upon one side of her upper lip,}
\stick{put in into \textit{La Rebours}’s hand\tsk \textit{La Re}-}
\textit{bours} shook her head.\patch{The}

The Lady \textit{Baussiere} cough’d thrice into\break
\stick{the inside of her muff\tsk \textit{La Guyol} smiled}
\stick{\tsk Fy, said the Lady \textit{Baussiere}. The queen}
\stick{of \textit{Navarre} touched her eye with the tip} 
\stick{of her fore finger\tsk as much as to say, I}
understand you all.

’Twas plain to the whole court the\break
\stick{word was ruined: \textit{La Fosseuse} had given} 
\stick{it a wound, and it was not the better for} 
\stick{passing through all these defiles\tsk It}
\stick{made a faint stand, however, for a few} 
\stick{months; by the expiration of which,}
\stick{the Sieur \textit{de Croix}, finding it high time} 
\stick{to leave \textit{Navarre} for want of whiskers\tsk}
\stick{the word in course became indecent, and}
\stick{(after a few efforts) absolutely unfit for}
use.

The best word, in the best language\break
\stick{of the best world, must have suffered un-}\catch{der} 
\stick{der such combinations.\tsh The curate of}
\stick{\textit{d’Estella} wrote a book against them, set-}
\stick{ting forth the dangers of accessory ideas,} 
and warning the \textit{Navarois} against them.

Does not all the world know, said the\break
\stick{curate \textit{d’Estella} at the conclusion of his}
\stick{work, that Noses ran the same fate some} 
\stick{centuries ago in most parts of \textit{Europe},} 
\stick{which Whiskers have now done in the}
\stick{kingdom of \textit{Navarre}\tsk The evil indeed} 
\stick{spread no farther then\tsk, but have not} 
\stick{beds and bolsters, and night-caps and}
\stick{chamber-pots stood upon the brink of de-}
\stick{struction ever since? Are not trouse, and} 
\stick{placket-holes, and pump-handles\tsk and} 
\stick{spigots and faucets, in danger still, from}
\stk{the same association?\tsk Chastity, by nature,}
\stick{the gentlest of all affections\tsk give it but} 
\stick{its head\tsk ’tis like a ramping and a roar-}
ing lion.\patch{The}

The drift of the curate \textit{d’Estella}’s argu-\break
\stick{ment was not understood.\tsk They ran} 
\stick{the scent the wrong way.\tsk The world} 
\stick{bridled his ass at the tail.\tsk And when}
\stick{the \textit{extreams} of \textscl{delicacy}, and the \textit{be}-}
\stick{\textit{ginnings} of \textscl{concupiscence}, hold their} 
\stick{next provincial chapter together, they}
may decree that bawdy also.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  II.}

\dropcap{W}{hen} my father received the\break
letter which brought him the\break
\stck{melancholy account of my brother \textit{Bobby}’s}
\stick{death, he was busy calculating the ex-}
\stick{pence of his riding post from \textit{Calais} to} 
\textit{Paris}, and so on to \textit{Lyons}.

\setlength{\baselineskip}{12.7826pt}  % 21*14 = 294   294/23 \simeq 12.7826 
’Twas a most inauspicious journey;\break
\stick{my father having had every foot of it to}
\stick{travel over again, and his calculation to} 
\stick{begin afresh, when he had almost got}\catch{to}
\stick{to the end of it, by \textit{Obadiah}’s opening}
\stick{the door to acquaint him the family was} 
\stick{out of yeast\tsk and to ask whether he}
\stick{might not take the great coach-horse}
\stick{early in the morning, and ride in search}
\stick{of some.\tsk With all my heart, \textit{Obadiah},}
\stick{said my father, (pursuing his journey)\tsk} 
\stick{take the coach-horse, and welcome.\tsk}
\stick{But he wants a shoe, poor creature! said}
\stick{\textit{Obadiah}.\tsk Poor creature! said my uncle}
\stick{\toby, vibrating the note back again, like}
\stick{a string in unison. Then ride the \textit{Scotch}} 
\stick{horse, quoth my father hastily.\tsk He can-}
\stick{not bear a saddle upon his back, quoth} 
\stick{\textit{Obadiah}, for the whole world.\tsh}
\stick{The devil’s in that horse; then take}
\stick{\textscl{Patriot}, cried my father, and shut}
\stick{the door.\tsh \textscl{Patriot} is sold, said}
\stick{\textit{Obadiah}.\tsk Here’s for you!\@ cried my fa-}
\stick{ther, making a pause, and looking in}
\stick{my uncle \toby's face, as if the thing had}
\stick{not been a matter of fact.\tsk Your wor-}\catch{ship} 
\stick{ship ordered me to sell him last \textit{April},}
\stick{said \textit{Obadiah}.\tsk Then go on foot for your}
\stick{pains, cried my father.\tsk I had much ra-}
\stick{ther walk than ride, said \textit{Obadiah}, shut-}
ting the door.

What plagues! cried my father, go-\break 
\stick{ing on with his calculation.\tsh But the}
\stick{waters are out, said \textit{Obadiah},\tsk opening} 
the door again.

Till that moment, my father, who\break
\stick{had a map of \textit{Sanson}’s, and a book of the}
\stick{post-roads before him, had kept his hand} 
\stick{upon the head of his compasses, with one}
\stick{foot of them fixed upon \textit{Nevers}, the last}
\stick{stage he had paid for\tsk purposing to go}
\stick{on from that point with his journey and}
\stick{calculation, as soon as \textit{Obadiah} quitted}
\stick{the room; but this second attack of \textit{Oba}-}
\stick{\textit{diah}’s, in opening the door and laying} 
\stick{the whole country under water, was too}
\stick{much.\tsh He let go his compasses\tsk or ra-}\catch{ther} 
\stick{ther with a mixed motion betwixt acci-}
\stick{dent and anger, he threw them upon the}
\stick{table; and then there was nothing for}
\stck{him to do, but to return back to \textit{Calais} (like}
many others) as wise as he had set out.

When the letter was brought into the\break
\stick{parlour, which contained the news of} 
\stick{my brother’s death, my father had got} 
\stick{forwards again upon his journey to with-}
\stick{in a stride of the compasses of the very} 
\stick{same stage of \textit{Nevers}.\tsk By your leave,}
\stick{Mons.\@ \textit{Sanson}, cried my father, striking} 
\stick{the point of his compasses through \textit{Ne}-}
\stick{\textit{vers} into the table,\tsk and nodding to my}
\stick{uncle \toby, to see what was in the letter,}
\stck{\tsk twice of one night is too much for an}
\stick{English gentleman and his son, Mons.}
\stick{\textit{Sanson}, to be turned back from so lousy} 
\stick{a town as \textit{Nevers},\tsk what think’st thou,}
\stick{\toby, added my father in a sprightly tone.}
\stick{\tsk Unless it be a garrison town, said my}
\stick{uncle \textit{Toby},\tsk for then\tsk I shall be a fool,}\catch{said}
\stick{said my father, smiling to himself, as}
\stick{long as I live.\tsk So giving a second nod}
\stick{\tsk and keeping his compasses still upon}
\stick{\textit{Nevers} with one hand, and holding his} 
\stick{book of the post-roads in the other\tsk}
\stick{half calculating and half listening, he}
\stick{leaned forwards upon the table with both}
\stick{elbows, as my uncle \toby hummed over}
the letter.

\stick{able to moderate the violence of her}
\stick{passions, she abruptly broke off her work}
\stick{\tsk My father stuck his compasses into} 
\stick{\textit{Nevers}, but so much the faster.\tsk What} 
\stick{contrarieties! his, indeed, was matter of}
\stick{calculation\tsk \textit{Agrippina}’s must have been} 
\stick{quite a different affair; who else could} 
pretend to reason from history?

How my father went on, in my opi-\break

\quad \tsh \quad \tsh \quad And a chapter it\break 
shall have, and a devil of a one too\tsk so\break 
look to yourselves.

’Tis either \textit{Plato}, or \textit{Plutarch}, or \textit{Sene-\break
ca}, or \textit{Xenophon}, or \textit{Epictetus}, or \textit{Theo}-\catch{\textit{phrastus},} 
\textit{phrastus}, or \textit{Lucian}\tsk or some one per-\break
haps of later date\tsk either \textit{Cardan}, or \textit{Bu-\break
dæus}, or \textit{Petrarch}, or \textit{Stella}\tsk or possibly\break
it may be some divine or father of the\break
church, St.\@ \textit{Austin}, or St.\@ \textit{Cyprian}, or\break
\textit{Barnard}, who affirms that it is an irresis-\break
table and natural passion to weep for the\break
\tight{loss of our friends or children\tsk and \textit{Seneca}}\break
(I’m positive) tells us somewhere, that\break
such griefs evacuate themselves best by\break
that particular channel.\tsk And accord-\break
ingly we find, that \textit{David} wept for his\break
son \textit{Absalom}\tsk \textit{Adrian} for his \textit{Antinous}\tsk\break
\textit{Niobe} for her children, and that \textit{Apollo-\break
dorus} and \textit{Crito} both shed tears for \textit{Socra-\break
tes} before his death.

\tight{My father managed his affliction other}-\break
wise; and indeed differently from most\break
men either ancient or modern; for he\break
neither wept it away, as the \textit{Hebrews} and\break
the \textit{Romans}\tsk or slept it off, as the \textit{Lap-\break
landers}\tsk or hang’d it, as the \textit{English}, or\break
drowned it, as the \textit{Germans}\tsk nor did he\catch{curse} 
curse it, or damn it, or excommunicate\break 
it, or rhyme it, or lillabullero it.\tsh

\tsh  He got rid of it, however.

Will your worships give me leave to\break
\tighter{squeeze in a story between these two pages?}

When \textit{Tully} was bereft of his dear\break
\stick{daughter \textit{Tullia}, at first he laid it to his}
\stick{heart,\tsk he listened to the voice of nature,}
\stick{and modulated his own unto it.\tsk O my}
\stick{\textit{Tullia!} my daughter!  my child!\tsk still,}
\stick{still, still,\tsk ’twas O my \textit{Tullia!}\tsh my}
\stick{\textit{Tullia!} Methinks I see my \textit{Tullia}, I}
\stick{hear my \textit{Tullia}, I talk with my \textit{Tullia}.\tsk}
\stick{But as soon as he began to look into the}
\stick{stores of philosophy, and consider how}
\stck{many excellent things might be said upon} 
\stick{the occasion\tsk no body upon earth can}
\stick{conceive, says the great orator, how hap-}
py, how joyful it made me.


My father was as proud of his elo-\break
quence as \textscl{Marcus Tullius Cicero}\catch{could} 
\stick{could be for his life, and for aught I am}
\stick{convinced of to the contrary at present,}
\stick{with as much reason: it was indeed his}
\stick{strength\tsk and his weakness too.\tsk His}
\stick{strength\tsk for he was by nature eloquent,}
\stick{\tsk and his weakness\tsk for he was hourly}
\stick{a dupe to it; and provided an occasion} 
\stick{in life would but permit him to shew his}
\stick{talents, or say either a wise thing, a witty,} 
\stick{or a shrewd one\tsk (bating the case of a}
\stick{systematick misfortune)\tsk he had all he}
\stick{wanted.\tsk A blessing which tied up my}
\stick{father’s tongue, and a misfortune which} 
\stick{set it loose with a good grace, were pretty}
\stick{equal: sometimes, indeed, the misfor-}
\stick{tune was the better of the two; for in-}
\stck{stance, where the pleasure of the harangue} 
\stick{was as \textit{ten}, and the pain of the misfor-}
\stick{tune but as \textit{five}\tsk my father gained half} 
\stick{in half, and consequently was as well} 
again off, as it never had befallen him.  

This clue will unravel, what otherwise would seem very
inconsistent in my fa-\catch{ther’s} ther’s domestick character; and it is
this, that, in the provocations arising from the neglects and
blunders of servants, or o\-ther mishaps unavoidable in a family, his
anger, or rather the duration of it, eternally ran counter to all
conjecture.

My father had a favourite little mare,\break
\stick{which he had consigned over to a most}
\stick{beautiful Arabian horse, in order to have}
\stick{a pad out of her for his own riding: he} 
\stick{was sanguine in all his projects; so talk-}
\stick{ed about his pad every day with as abso-}
\stick{lute a security, as if it had been reared,}
\stick{broke,\tsk and bridled and saddled at his}
\stick{door ready for mounting. By some neg-}
\stick{lect or other in \textit{Obadiah}, it so fell out,}
\stick{that my father’s expectations were an-}
\stick{swered with nothing better than a mule,} 
\stick{and as ugly a beast of the kind as ever}
was produced.

My mother and my uncle \toby expect-\break
\stick{ed my father would be the death of \textit{Oba}-}\catch{\textit{diah}} 
\stick{\textit{diah}\tsk and that there never would be an}
\stick{end of the disaster.\tsh See here! you}
\stick{rascal, cried my father, pointing to the}
\stick{mule, what you have done!\tsk It was not}
\stick{me, said \textit{Obadiah}.\tsk How do I know} 
that? replied my father.

Triumph swam in my father’s eyes, at\break
\stick{the repartee\tsk the \textit{Attic} salt brought wa-}
\stick{ter into them\tsk and so \textit{Obadiah} heard no}
more about it.

Now let us go back to my brother’s\break death.

Philosophy has a fine saying for every\break
\stick{thing.\tsk For \textit{Death} it has an entire set;}
\stick{the misery was, they all at once rushed}
\stick{into my father’s head, that ’twas difficult}
\stick{to string them together, so as to make} 
\stick{any thing of a consistent show out of} 
them.\tsk He took them as they came.

\indent\lqq ’Tis an inevitable chance\tsk the first\break

\indent
\lqq \tsk \textit{To die}, is the great debt and tri-\break

\stick{\lqq memories, pay it themselves; and the}\break
\stick{\lqq proudest pyramid of them all, which}\break
\stick{\lqq wealth and science have erected, has}\break
\stick{\lqq lost its apex, and stands obtruncated in}\break

\stick{\textit{Shandy}, said my uncle \toby, laying down}
\stick{his pipe at the word \textit{evolutions}\tsk Revolu-}
\stick{tions, I meant, quoth my father,\tsk by} 
\stick{heaven! I meant revolutions, brother} 
\stick{\textit{Toby}\tsk evolutions is nonsense.\tsk ’Tis not}

\stck{it not nonsense to break the thread of such}

\stick{nued he, taking him by the hand, do not}
\stick{\tsk do not, I beseech thee, interrupt me at} 
\stick{this crisis.\tsk My uncle \toby put his pipe}
into his mouth.

\lqq Where is \textit{Troy} and \textit{Mycenæ}, and\break

\newpage
\noindent
\stick{\hfill Now my uncle \toby knew not that this}
\stick{last paragraph was an extract of \textit{Servius}}
\stick{\textit{Sulpicius}’s consolatory letter to \textit{Tully}.\tsk}
\stick{He had as little skill, honest man, in the}
\stick{fragments, as he had in the whole pieces}
\stick{of antiquity.\tsk And as my father, whilst}
\stick{he was concerned in the \textit{Turky} trade, had} 
\stick{been three or four different times in the}
\stick{\textit{Levant}, in one of which he had staid a} 
\stick{whole year and an half at \textit{Zant}, my uncle} 
\stick{\toby naturally concluded, that in some} 
\stick{one of these periods, he had taken a} 
\stick{trip across the \textit{Archipelago} into \textit{Asia}; and}
\stick{that all this sailing affair with \textit{Ægina} be-}
\stick{hind, and \textit{Megara} before, and \textit{Pyræus} on} 
\stick{the right hand, \etc \etc was nothing}
\stick{more than the true course of my father’s}
\stick{voyage and reflections.\tsk ’Twas certainly}
\stick{in his \textit{manner}, and many an undertaking}
\stick{critick would have built two stories high-}
\stick{er upon worse foundations.\tsk And pray,} 
\stick{brother, quoth my uncle \toby, laying the}
\stick{end of his pipe upon my father’s hand}\catch{in} 
\stick{in a kindly way of interruption\tsk but}
\stick{waiting till he finished the account\tsk} 
\stick{what year of our Lord was this?\tsk ’Twas} 
\stick{no year of our Lord, replied my father.}
\stick{\tsk That’s impossible, cried my uncle \toby.}
\stick{\tsk Simpleton! said my father,\tsk ’twas for-} 
ty years before Christ was born.

My uncle \toby had but two things for\break
\stick{it; either to suppose his brother to be} 
\stick{the wandering \textit{Jew}, or that his misfor-}
\stick{tunes had disordered his brain.\tsk \lqq May}
\stick{\lqq the Lord God of heaven and earth}
\stick{\lqq protect him and restore him,” said my}
\stck{uncle \toby, praying silently for my father,}
and with tears in his eyes.

\tsk My father placed the tears to a pro-\break 
\stick{per account, and went on with his ha-}
rangue with great spirit.

\indent\lqq There is not such great odds, bro-\break
\stick{\lqq ther \toby, betwixt good and evil, as}
\stick{\lqq the world imagines\,”\tsh (this way of}\catch{set-}
\stick{setting off, by the bye, was not likely to}
\stick{cure my uncle \toby's suspicions.\sic\tsk \lqq La-}
\stick{\lqq bour, sorrow, grief, sickness, want, and}
\stick{\lqq woe, are the sauces of life.”\tsk Much}
\stick{good may\sic do them\tsk said my uncle \toby} 
to himself.\tsh

\indent\lqq My son is dead!\tsk so much the bet-\break
\lqq ter;\tsk ’tis a shame in such a tempest to\break
\lqq have but one anchor.\,”

\indent\lqq But he is gone for ever from us!\tsk\break
\stick{\lqq be it so. He is got from under the}
\stick{\lqq hands of his barber before he was bald.}
\stick{\lqq \tsk he is but risen from a feast before}
\stick{\lqq he was surfeited\tsk from a banquet be-}
\lqq fore he had got drunken.\,”

\indent\lqq The \textit{Thracians} wept when a child\break
\stick{\lqq was born\,”\tsk (and we were very near}
\stick{it, quoth my uncle \toby)\tsk \lqq and feasted}
\stick{\lqq and made merry when a man went}
\lqq out of the world; and with reason.\tsk\catch{\lqq Death}
\stick{\lqq Death opens the gate of fame, and}
\stick{\lqq shuts the gate of envy after it,\tsk it}
\stick{\lqq unlooses the chain of the captive, and}
\stick{\lqq puts the bondsman’s task into another}
\lqq man’s hands.\,”

\indent\lqq Shew me the man, who knows what\break
\stick{\lqq life is, who dreads it, and I’ll shew thee}
\lqq a prisoner who dreads his liberty.\,”

Is it not better, my dear brother \toby,\break
\stick{(for mark\tsk our appetites are but diseases)}
\tsk is it not better not to hunger at all, than to eat?\tsk not to thirst, than to
take physick to cure it?

Is it not better to be freed from cares and agues, from love and
melancholy, and the other hot and cold fits of life, than like
a galled traveller, who comes weary to his inn, to be bound to
begin his journey afresh?

There is no terror, brother \toby, in its\break
\stick{looks, but what it borrows from groans}\catch{and}
\stick{and convulsions\tsk and the blowing of}
\stick{noses, and the wiping away of tears with} 
\stick{the bottoms of curtains, in a dying man’s} 
\stick{room.\tsk Strip it of these, what is it\tsk} 
\stick{’Tis better in battle than in bed, said my} 
\stick{uncle \toby.\tsk Take away its herses, its} 
\stick{mutes, and its mourning,\tsk its plumes,} 
\stick{scutcheons, and other mechanic aids\tsk} 
\stick{What is it?\tsk \textit{Better in battle!} continued}
\stick{my father, smiling, for he had absolutely}
\stick{forgot my brother \textit{Bobby}\tsk ’tis terrible no}
\stick{way\tsk for consider, brother \toby,\tsk when}
\stick{we \textit{are}\tsk death is \textit{not};\tsk and when death}
\stick{\textit{is}\tsk we are \textit{not}. My uncle \toby laid}
\stick{down his pipe to consider the proposi-}
\stick{tion; my father’s eloquence was too ra-}
\stick{pid to stay for any man\tsk away it went,}
\stick{\tsk and hurried my uncle \toby's ideas} 
along with it.\tsh

For this reason, continued my father,\break
\stick{’tis worthy to recollect, how little alte-}
\stick{ration in great men, the approaches of}\catch{death}
\stick{death have made.\tsk \textit{Vespasian} died in a} 
\stick{jest upon his close stool\tsk \textit{Galba} with a}
\stick{sentence\tsk \textit{Septimus Severus} in a dispatch}
\stick{\tsk \textit{Tiberius} in dissimulation, and \textit{Cæsar}}
\stick{\textit{Augustus} in a compliment.\tsk I hope ’twas} 
a sincere one\tsk quoth my uncle \toby.

\tsk ’Twas to his wife,\tsk said my father.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  IV.}

\quad\tsh  And lastly\tsk for all the choice anecdotes which
history can produce of this matter, continued my father,\tsk
this, like the gilded dome which covers in the fabrick\tsk
crowns all.\tsk

’Tis of \textit{Cornelius Gallus}, the
prætor\tsk which I dare say, brother \toby, you have
read.\tsk I dare say I have not, replied my uncle.\tsk He died,
said my father as\break
\stick{\astfill}\break

hurt in it.\catch{\tsk That’s}

\dropcap{M}{y} mother was going very ginger-\break
ly in the dark along the passage\break
\stick{which led to the parlour, as my uncle} 
\stick{\toby pronounced the word \textit{wife}.\tsk ’Tis a}
\stick{shrill, penetrating sound of itself, and \textit{O}-}
\stick{\textit{badiah} had helped it by leaving the door}
\stick{a little a-jar, so that my mother heard} 
\stick{enough of it, to imagine herself the sub-}
\stick{ject of the conversation: so laying the} 
\stick{edge of her finger across her two lips\tsk}
\stick{holding in her breath, and bending her}
\stick{head a little downwards, with a twist of}

\stick{all her powers:\tsh the listening slave,}
\stick{with the Goddess of Silence at his back,}
\stick{could not have given a finer thought for}
an intaglio.\patch{In}

In this attitude I am determined to let\break
\stick{her stand for five minutes: till I bring}
\stick{up the affairs of the kitchen (as \textit{Rapin}}
\stick{does those of the church) to the same}
period.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  VI.}

\dropcap{T}{hough} in one sense, our family\break
was certainly a simple machine, as\break
\stick{it consisted of a few wheels; yet there}
\stick{was thus much to be said for it, that}
\stick{these wheels were set in motion by so} 
\stick{many different springs, and acted one} 
\stick{upon the other from such a variety of} 
\stick{strange principles and impulses,\tsh that} 
\stick{though it was a simple machine, it had} 
\stick{all the honour and advantages of a com-}
\stick{plex one,\tsh and a number of as odd}
\stick{movements within it, as ever were be-}
held in the inside of a \textit{Dutch} silk-mill.

Amongst these there was one, I am\break
\stick{going to speak of, in which, perhaps, it}\catch{was}
\stck{was not altogether so singular, as in many} 
\stick{others; and it  was this, that whatever} 
\stick{motion, debate, harangue, dialogue, pro-}
\stick{ject, or dissertation, was going forwards} 
\stick{in the parlour, there was generally ano-}
\stick{ther at the same time, and upon the same} 
\stick{subject, running parallel along with it in} 
the kitchen.

Now to bring this about, whenever an\break
\stick{extraordinary message, or letter, was de-}
\stick{livered in the parlour,\tsk or a discourse}
\stick{suspended till a servant went out\tsk or the}
\stick{lines of discontent were observed to hang} 
\stick{upon the brows of my father or mother}
\stick{\tsk or, in short, when any thing was sup-}
\stick{posed to be upon the tapis worth know-}
\stick{ing or listening to, ’twas the rule to leave} 
\stick{the door, not absolutely shut, but some-}
\stck{what a-jar\tsk as it stands just now,\tsk which,}
\stick{under covert of the bad hinge, (and that}
\stick{possibly might be one of the many rea-}
\stick{sons why it was never mended) it was} 
\stick{not difficult to manage; by which means,}\catch{in}
\stck{in all these cases, a passage was generally}
\stick{left, not indeed as wide as the \textit{Dardanells},}
\stick{but wide enough, for all that, to carry} 
\stick{on as much of this windward trade, as}
\stick{was sufficient to save my father the trou-}
\stick{ble of governing his house;\tsk my mother}
\stick{at this moment stands profiting by it.\tsk} 
\stick{\textit{Obadiah} did the same thing, as soon as}
\stick{he had left the letter upon the table which}
\stick{brought the news of my brother’s death;} 
\stick{so that before my father had well got} 
\stick{over his surprize, and entered upon his} 
\stick{harangue,\tsk had \trim got upon his legs,} 
\tight{to speak his sentiments upon the subject}.

A curious observer of nature, had he\break
\stick{been worth the inventory of all \textit{Job}’s}
\stick{stock\tsk though by the bye, \textit{your curious}}
\stick{\textit{observers are seldom worth a groat}\tsk would} 
\stick{have given the half of it, to have heard}

The corporal\tsk with nothing\tsk to re-\break

\dropcap{T}{he} first thing which entered my\break
father’s head, after affairs were a\break
\stick{little settled in the family, and \textit{Susannah}}
\stick{had got possession of my mother’s green}
\stick{sattin night-gown,\tsk was to sit down}
\stick{coolly, after the example of \textit{Xenophon},} 
\stick{and write a \textscl{Tristra}-\textit{pœdia}\sic, or system} 
\stick{of education for me; collecting first for} 
\stick{that purpose his own scattered thoughts,} 
\stick{counsels, and notions; and binding them} 
\stick{together, so as to form an \textscl{institute} for} 
\stck{the government of my childhood and ado-}
\stick{\hfill le\ scence.\sic}


\vfill\eject\noindent
\stick{lescence. I was my father’s last stake\tsk} 
\stick{he had lost my brother \textit{Bobby} entirely,\tsk}
\stick{he had lost, by his own computation,}
\stick{full three fourths of me\tsk that is, he had} 
\stick{been unfortunate in his three first great}
\stick{casts for me\tsk my geniture, nose, and} 
\stick{name,\tsk there was but this one left; and} 
\stick{accordingly my father gave himself up} 
\stick{to it with as much devotion as ever my}
\stick{uncle \toby had done to his doctrine of} 
\stick{projectils.\tsk The difference between them} 
\stick{was, that my uncle \toby drew his whole} 
\stick{knowledge of projectils from \textit{Nicholas}}
\stick{\textit{Tartaglia}\tsk My father spun his, every} 
\stick{thread of it, out of his own brain,\tsk or}
\stick{reeled and cross-twisted what all other}
\stick{spinners and spinsters had spun before}
\stick{him, that ’twas pretty near the same tor-}
ture to him.

In about three years, or something\break\etp
\stick{more, my father had got advanced al-}
\stick{most into the middle of his work.\tsk Like} 
\stick{all other writers, he met with disappoint-}\catch{ments.} 
\stick{ments.\tsk He imagined he should be}
\stick{able to bring whatever he had to say,}
\stick{into so small a compass, that when it}
\stick{was finished and bound, it might be}
\stick{rolled up in my mother’s hussive.\tsk Mat-}
\stick{ter grows under our hands.\tsk Let no man}
say,\tsk “Come\tsk I’ll write a \textit{duodecimo}.”

My father gave himself up to it, how-\break
\stick{ever, with the most painful diligence,}
\stick{proceeding step by step in every line,}
\stick{with the same kind of caution and cir-}
\stick{cumspection (though I cannot say upon}
\stick{quite so religious a principle) as was used}
\stick{by \textit{John de la Casse}, the lord archbishop} 
\stick{of \textit{Benevento}, in compassing his \textit{Galatea};}
\stick{in which his Grace of \textit{Benevento} spent} 
\stick{near forty years of his life; and when}
\stick{the thing came out, it was not of above} 
\stick{half the size or the thickness of a \textit{Rider}’s}
\stick{Almanack.\tsk How the holy man mana-}
\stick{ged the affair, unless he spent the great-}
\stick{est part of his time in combing his whis-}\catch{kers,} 
\stick{kers, or playing at \textit{primero} with his chap-}
\stick{lain,\tsk would pose any mortal not let into} 
\stick{the true secret;\tsk and therefore ’tis worth} 
\stick{explaining to the world, was it only for} 
\stick{the encouragement of those few in it,}
\stick{who write not so much to be fed\tsk as to}
be famous.

I own had \textit{John de la Casse}, the arch-\break
\stick{bishop of \textit{Benevento}, for whose memory}
\stick{(notwithstanding his \textit{Galatea)}\sic I retain}
\stick{the highest veneration,\tsk had he been,}
\stick{Sir, a slender clerk\tsk of dull wit\tsk slow}
\stick{parts\tsk costive head, and so forth,\tsk he} 
\stick{and his \textit{Galatea} might have jogged on}
\stick{together to the age of \textit{Methuselah} for}
\stick{me,\tsk the phænomenon had not been} 
worth a parenthesis.\tsk

But the reverse of this was the truth:\break
\stick{\textit{John de la Casse} was a genius of fine parts}
\stick{and fertile fancy; and yet with all these} 
\stick{great advantages of nature, which should}\catch{have} 
\stick{have pricked him forwards with his \textit{Ga}-}
\stick{\textit{latea}, he lay under an impuissance at the} 
\stick{same time of advancing above a line and}
\stick{a half in the compass of a whole sum-}
\stick{mer’s day: this disability in his Grace}
\stick{arose from an opinion he was afflicted}
\stick{with,\tsk which opinion was this,\tsk \textit{viz}.\@ that} 
\stick{whenever a Christian was writing a book}
\stick{(not for his private amusement, but)} 
\stick{where his intent and purpose was \textit{bonâ}}
\stick{\textit{fide}, to print and publish it to the world,}
\stick{his first thoughts were always the temp-}
\stick{tations of the evil one.\tsk This was the}
\stick{state of ordinary writers: but when a}
\stick{personage of venerable character and}
\stick{high station, either in church or state,}
\stick{once turned author,\tsk he maintained,}
\stick{that from the very moment he took pen}
\stick{in hand\tsk all the devils in hell broke out}
\stick{of their holes to cajole him.\tsk ’Twas} 
\stick{Term-time with them,\tsk every thought,}
\stick{first and last, was captious;\tsk how spe-}\catch{cious} 
\stick{cious and good soever,\tsk ’twas all one;}
\stick{\tsk in whatever form or colour it present-}
\stick{ed itself to the imagination,\tsk ’twas still}
\stick{a stroke of one or other of ’em levelled}
\stick{at him, and was to be fenced off.\tsk So}
\stick{that the life of a writer, whatever he}
\stick{might fancy to the contrary, was not so} 
\stick{much a state of \textit{composition}, as a state of}
\stick{\textit{warfare}; and his probation in it, precisely}
\stick{that of any other man militant upon}
\stick{earth,\tsk both depending alike, not half} 
\stick{so much upon the degrees of his \textscl{wit}\tsk}
as his \textscl{resistance}.

My father was hugely pleased with\break
\stick{this theory of \textit{John de la Casse}, archbi-}
\stick{shop of \textit{Benevento;} and (had it not}
\stick{cramped him a little in his creed) I be-}
\stick{lieve would have given ten of the best}
\stick{acres in the \textit{Shandy} estate, to have been}
\stick{the broacher of it.\tsk How far my father}
\stick{actually believed in the devil, will be} 
\stick{seen, when I come to speak of my fa-}\catch{ther’s} 
\stick{ther’s religious notions, in the progress} 
\stick{of this work: ’tis enough to say here,} 
\stick{as he could not have the honour of it,} 
\stick{in the literal sense of the doctrine\tsk he}
\stick{took up with the allegory of it;\tsk and} 
\stick{would often say, especially when his pen}
\stick{was a little retrograde, there was as much} 
\stick{good meaning, truth, and knowledge,}
\stick{couched under the veil of \textit{John de la}}
\stick{\textit{Casse}’s parabolical representation,\tsk as} 
\stick{was to be found in any one poetic fiction,}
\stick{or mystick record of antiquity.\tsk Preju-}
\stick{dice of education, he would say, \textit{is the}}
\stick{\textit{devil},\tsk and the multitudes of them which}
\stick{we suck in with our mother’s milk\tsk \textit{are}}
\stick{\textit{the devil and all}.\tsh We are haunted}
\stick{with them, brother \toby, in all our lucu-}
\stick{brations and researches; and was a man} 
\stick{fool enough to submit tamely to what}
\stick{they obtruded upon him,\tsk what would}
\stick{his book be?  Nothing,\tsk he wou’d add,} 
\stick{throwing his pen away with a vengeance,} 
\stick{\tsk nothing but a farrago of the clack of}\catch{nurses,}
\stick{nurses, and of the nonsense of the old} 
\stick{women (of both sexes) throughout the}
kingdom.

This is the best account I am deter-\break
\stick{mined to give of the slow progress my} 
\stck{father made in his \textit{Tristra-pædia;} at which} 
\stick{(as I said) he was three years and some-}
\stick{thing more, indefatigably at work, and}
\stick{at last, had scarce compleated, by his}
\stick{own reckoning, one half of his under-}
\stick{taking: the misfortune was, that I was}
\stick{all that time totally neglected and aban-}
\stick{doned to my mother; and what was al-}
\stick{most as bad, by the very delay, the first}
\stick{part of the work, upon which my father}
\stick{had spent the most of his pains, was ren-}
\stick{dered entirely useless,\tsh every day a}
\stick{page or two became of no conse-}
quence.\tsh

\tsh Certainly it was ordained as a\break
\stick{scourge upon the pride of human wis-}\catch{dom,}
\stick{dom, That the wisest of us all, should}
\stick{thus outwit ourselves, and eternally fore-}
\stick{go our purposes in the intemperate act}
of pursuing them.

In short, my father was so long in all\break
\stick{his acts of resistance,\tsk or in other words,}
\stick{\tsk he advanced so very slow with his} 
\stick{work, and I began to live and get for-}
\stick{wards at such a rate, that if an event}
\stick{had not happened,\tsh which, when we} 
\stick{get to it, if it can be told with decency,}
\stick{shall not be concealed a moment from} 
\stick{the reader\tsh I verily believe, I had} 
\stick{put by my father, and left him drawing} 
\stick{a sun-dial, for no better purpose than to}
be buried under ground.\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

\stick{’Tis my own affair: I’ll explain it my-}

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  XIX.}

\dropcap{’T}{is} a pity, \trim, said my uncle\break 
\toby, resting with his hand up-\break
\stick{on the corporal’s shoulder, as they both}
\stick{stood surveying their works,\tsk that we}\catch{have} 
\stick{have not a couple of field-pieces to mount}

\stick{complete:\tsh get me a couple cast,}
\trim.

Your honour shall have them, re-\break
plied \trim, before to-morrow morning.

It was the joy of \trim's heart,\tsk nor\break
\stick{was his fertile head ever at a loss for ex-}
\stick{pedients in doing it, to supply my uncle}
\stick{\toby in his campaigns, with whatever his} 
\stick{fancy called for; had it been his last} 
\stick{crown, he would have sate down and}
\stick{hammered it into a paderero to have pre-}
\stick{vented a single wish in his Master. The} 
\stick{corporal had already,\tsk what with cut-}
\stick{ting off the ends of my uncle \toby's} 
\stick{spouts\tsk hacking and chiseling up the} 
\stick{sides of his leaden gutters,\tsk melting} 
\stick{down his pewter shaving bason,\tsk and}\catch{going}
\stick{going at last, like \textit{Lewis} the fourteenth,}
\stick{on to the top of the church, for spare}
\stick{ends, \&c.\tsh he had that very cam-}
\stick{paign brought no less than eight new}
\stick{battering cannons, besides three demi-}
\stick{culverins into the field; my uncle \toby's}
\stick{demand for two more pieces for the re-}
\stick{doubt, had set the corporal at work}
\stick{again; and no better resource offering,}
\stck{he had taken the two leaden weights from}
\stick{the nursery window: and as the sash}
\stick{pullies, when the lead was gone, were}
\stick{of no kind of use, he had taken them}
\stick{away also, to make a couple of wheels}
for one of their carriages.

\tight{He had dismantled every sash window}\break 
\stick{in my uncle \toby's house long before, in}
\stick{the very same way,\tsk though not always}
\stick{in the same order; for sometimes the}
\stick{pullies had been wanted, and not the}
\stick{lead,\tsk so then he began with the pullies,}
\stick{\tsk and the pullies being picked out, then}\catch{the}
\stick{the lead became useless,\tsk and so the lead} 
went to pot too.

\tsh  A great \textscl{moral} might be picked\break
\stick{handsomly out of this, but I have not} 
\stick{time\tsk ’tis enough to say, wherever the}
\stick{demolition began, ’twas equally fatal to}
the sash window.

\dropcap{T}{he} corporal had not taken his\break
measures so badly in this stroke of\break
\stick{artilleryship, but that he might have} 
\stick{kept the matter entirely to himself, and} 
\stick{left \textit{Susannah} to have sustained the whole} 
\stick{weight of the attack, as she could;\tsk}
\stick{true courage is not content with coming}
\stick{off so.\tsh The corporal, whether as ge-}

\stick{Susannah’\textit{s hands};\tsh How would your} 
\stick{honours have behaved?\tsh He deter-}

\stick{this resolution upon his mind, he march-}
\stick{ed upright into the parlour, to lay the}
whole \textit{manœuvre} before my uncle \toby.

My uncle \toby had just then been\break

\stick{\textit{Steenkirk}, and of the strange conduct of}
\stick{count \textit{Solmes} in ordering the foot to halt,} 
\stick{and the horse to march where it could}
\stick{not act; which was directly contrary to} 
\stick{the king’s commands, and proved the} 
loss of the day.

There are incidents in some families\break

\stick{but ’tis obviated under the second reason,}
\stick{which I have the honour to offer to the}
\stick{world in support of my opinion, that my}
\stick{father did not write the chapter upon}

\stick{\lqq launched himself aloft into the air, and}
\stick{\lqq placed both his feet together upon the}
\stick{\lqq saddle, standing upright, with his}
\stick{\lqq back turned towards his horse’s head,}
\stick{\lqq \tsk Now (said he) my case goes forward.}
\stick{\lqq Then suddenly in the same posture}
\stick{\lqq wherein he was, he fetched a gambol}
\stick{\lqq upon one foot, and turning to the left-}

\stick{\lqq fectly round, just into his former po-}
\stick{\lqq sition, without missing one jot.\tsh}
\stick{\lqq Ha!  said \textit{Tripet}, I will not do that}
\stick{\lqq at this time,\tsk and not without cause.}

\stick{\lqq I will undo this leap; then with a}
\stick{\lqq marvellous strength and agility, turn-}

\stick{\lqq side back, without \textit{touching any thing},}
\stick{\lqq he brought himself betwixt the horse’s}
\stick{\lqq two ears, and then giving himself a}

\lqq the crupper\tsh ”

(This can’t be fighting, said my uncle\break

at it.\tsh Have patience, said \textit{Yorick.)}\sic

\lqq Then \textit{(Tripet)} pass’d his right leg\break

\stick{\lqq and strait found himself betwixt the}
\stick{\lqq bow of the saddle in a tolerable seat;}
\stick{\lqq then springing into the air with a sum-}

\dropcap{T}{he} first thirty pages, said my\break
father, turning over the leaves,\tsk\break
\stick{are a little dry; and as they are not close-}
\stick{ly connected with the subject,\tsh for the}
\stick{present we’ll pass them by: ’tis a prefa-}\catch{tory} 
\stick{tory introduction, continued my father,}
\stick{or an introductory preface (for I am not} 
\stick{determined which name to give it) upon} 
\stick{political or civil government; the foun-}
\stick{dation of which being laid in the first} 
\stick{conjunction betwixt male and female,}
\stick{for procreation of the species\tsh I was}
\stick{insensibly led into it.\tsh ’Twas natural,} 
said \textit{Yorick}.

The original of society, continued my\break
\stick{father, I’m satisfied is, what \textit{Politian}}
\stick{tells us, \textit{i}\kern.05em.\,\textit{e}.\@ merely conjugal; and no-}
\stick{thing more than the getting together of} 
\stick{one man and one woman;\tsk to which,}
\stick{(according to \textit{Hesiod)}\sic the philosopher}
\stick{adds a servant:\tsk but supposing in the} 
\stck{first beginning there were no men servants}
\stick{born\tsh he lays the foundation of it,}
\stick{in a man,\tsk a woman\tsk and a bull.\tsh} 
\stick{I believe ’tis an ox, quoth \textit{Yorick}, quot-}
\stck{ing the passage ({\small οἶκον μὲν πρώτισα\sic, γυνᾶικα}}
\stick{{\small τε, βοῦν τ᾽ ἀροτηρα}.)\tsh A bull must have}\catch{given} 
\stick{given more trouble than his head was}
\stick{worth.\tsh But there is a better reason}
\stick{still, said my father (dipping his pen}
\stick{into his ink) for, the ox being the most}
\stick{patient of animals, and the most useful}
\stick{withal in tilling the ground for their} 
\stick{nourishment,\tsk was the properest instru-}
\stick{ment, and emblem too, for the new join-}
\stick{ed couple, that the creation could have} 
\stick{associated with them.\tsk And there is a} 
\stick{stronger reason, added my uncle \toby,} 
\stick{than them all for the ox.\tsk My father had}
\stick{not power to take his pen out of his ink-}
\stick{horn, till he had heard my uncle \toby's} 
\stick{reason.\tsk For when the ground was til-}
\stick{led, said my uncle \toby, and made worth}
\stick{inclosing, then they began to secure it}
\stick{by walls and ditches, which was the ori-}
\stick{gin of fortification.\tsh True, true; dear}
\stick{\toby, cried my father, striking out the} 
bull, and putting the ox in his place.

\etpp
My father gave \trim a nod, to snuff\break
the candle, and resumed his discourse.\patch{\tsh I}

\tsh I enter upon this speculation, said\break
\stick{my father carelessly, and half shutting} 
\stick{the book, as he went on,\tsk merely to}
\stick{shew the foundation of the natural rela-}

quires these several ways\tsk

1st, by marriage.

2d, by adoption.

3d, by legitimation.

And 4th, by procreation; all which I\break
consider in their order.

I lay a slight stress upon one of them;\break
\stick{replied \textit{Yorick}\tsh the act, especially}
\stick{where it ends there, in my opinion lays} 
\stick{as little obligation upon the child, as it}

I have concentrated all that can be\break

\stick{father, into a very little room, therefore}
we’ll read the chapter quite thro’.

My father read as follows.

\lqq The whole secret of health depend-\break

\stick{\lqq radical moisture\,”\tsk You have proved}
\stick{that matter of fact, I suppose, above,}
\stick{said \textit{Yorick}. Sufficiently, replied my}
father.

In saying this, my father shut the\break
\stick{book,\tsk not as if he resolved to read no}
\stick{more of it, for he kept his forefinger in} 
\stick{the chapter:\tsh nor pettishly,\tsk for he} 
\stick{shut the book slowly; his thumb resting,} 
\stick{when he had done it, upon the upper-}
\stick{side of the cover, as his three fingers sup-}
\stick{ported the lower-side of it, without the}
least compressive violence.\tsh\patch{I}

I have demonstrated the truth of that\break
\stick{point, quoth my father, nodding to \textit{Yo}-}
\stick{\textit{rick}, most sufficiently in the preceding}
chapter.

Now could the man in the moon be\break
\stick{told, that a man in the earth had wrote a} 
\stick{chapter, sufficiently demonstrating, That}
\stick{the secret of all health depended upon}
\stick{the due contention for mastery betwixt} 
\stick{the \textit{radical heat} and the \textit{radical moisture},\tsk} 
\stick{and that he had managed the point so} 
\stick{well, that there was not one single word}
\stick{wet or dry upon radical heat or radical} 
\stick{moisture, throughout the whole chap-}
\stick{ter,\tsk or a single syllable in it, \textit{pro} or}

\dropcap{W}{ith} two strokes, the one at\break
\textit{Hippocrates}, the other at Lord\break

The stroke at the prince of physicians,\break

\stick{a short insult upon his sorrowful com-}

\stick{\tsh Life short, cried my father,\tsk and}

\stick{nostrums, and peripatetic lumber, with}\catch{which}
\stick{which in all ages, they have first flatter’d} 
the world, and at last deceived it.

\tsh  O my lord \textit{Verulam!} cried my\break

\stick{\lqq stroy our organs, and render them}
\lqq unfit to carry on the functions of life.”

This being the state of the case; the\break
\stick{road to Longevity was plain; nothing} 
\stick{more being required, says his lordship,}\catch{but}
\stick{but to repair the waste committed by the}
\stick{internal spirit, by making the substance}

\stick{lar course of opiates on one side, and by}
\stick{refrigerating the heat of it on the other,} 
\stick{by three grains and a half of salt-petre}
every morning before you got up.\tsh

Still this frame of ours was left ex-\break
\stick{posed to the inimical assaults of the air}

\stick{by a course of greasy unctions, which}
\stick{so fully saturated the pores of the skin,}
\stick{that no spicula could enter;\tsk nor}
\stick{could any one get out.\tsk This put a}
\stck{stop to all perspiration, sensible and insen-}

\dropcap{T}{he} whole secret of health, said\break
my father, beginning the sentence\break 
\stick{again, depending evidently upon the due}
\stick{contention betwixt the radical heat and}
\stick{radical moisture within us;\tsk the least} 
\stick{imaginable skill had been sufficient to}
\stick{have maintained it, had not the school-}
\stick{men confounded the task, merely (as}
\stick{\textit{Van Helmont}, the famous chymist, has}
\stick{proved) by all along mistaking the ra-}
\stick{dical moisture for the tallow and fat of}
animal bodies.

Now the radical moisture is not the\break
\stick{tallow or fat of animals, but an oily and}
\stick{balsamous substance; for the fat and}
\stick{tallow, as also the phlegm or watery}\catch{parts,}
\stick{parts, are cold; whereas the oily and bal-}
\stick{samous parts are of a lively heat and spi-}
\stick{rit, which accounts for the observation} 
\stick{of \textit{Aristotle}, \lqq\textit{Quod omne animal post}}
\lqq \textit{coitum est} triste.”

Now it is certain, that the radical heat\break
\stick{lives in the radical moisture, but whether}
\stick{\textit{vice versâ}, is a doubt: however, when}
\stick{the one decays, the other decays also;} 
\stick{and then is produced, either an unnatu-}
\stick{ral heat, which causes an unnatural dry-}
\stick{ness\tsh or an unnatural moisture, which}
\stick{causes dropsies.\tsh So that if a child, as}
\stick{he grows up, can but be taught to avoid}

that head.\tsh\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

I believe, an’ please your honour,\break

\tsh It was heaven’s mercy to us,\break

\stick{and the radical moisture, by reinforce-}
\stick{ing the fever, as he did all along, with}
\stick{hot wine and spices; whereby the cor-}

\stick{entered upon the law so late in life, that}
\stick{every body imagined he intended to be} 
\stick{an advocate in the other world: no}
\stick{wonder, when \textit{Eudamidas}, the son of}
\stick{\textit{Archidamas}, heard \textit{Xenocrates} at seventy-}
\stick{five disputing about \textit{wisdom}, that he}
\stick{asked gravely,\tsk \textit{If the old man be yet}}
\stick{\textit{disputing and enquiring concerning wisdom},}\catch{\textit{\tsk what}}
\stick{\textit{\tsk what time will he have to make use of}}
\textit{it?}

\textit{Yorick} listened to my father with great\break
\stick{attention; there was a seasoning of wis-}
\stick{dom unaccountably mixed up with his} 
\stick{strangest whims, and he had sometimes}
\stick{such illuminations in the darkest of his}
\stick{eclipses, as almost attoned for them:\tsk}
be wary, Sir, when you imitate him.

I am convinced, \textit{Yorick}, continued\break
\stick{my father, half reading and half dis-}
\stick{coursing, that there is a North west pas-}
\stick{sage to the intellectual world; and that}
\stick{the soul of man has shorter ways of go-}
\stick{ing to work, in furnishing itself with}
\stick{knowledge and instruction, than we ge-}
\stick{nerally take with it.\tsh But alack! all} 
\stick{fields have not a river or a spring running}\catch{be-} 
\stick{besides them;\tsk every child, \textit{Yorick!} has}
not a parent to point it out.

\tsh The whole entirely depends, add-\break
\stick{ed my father, in a low voice, upon the}
\textit{auxiliary verbs}, Mr.\@ \textit{Yorick}.

Had \textit{Yorick} trod upon \textit{Virgil}\kern 0.5pt’s snake,\break
\stick{he could not have looked more surprised.}
\stick{\tsk I am surprised too, cried my father,}
\stick{observing it,\tsk and I reckon it as one of} 
\stick{the greatest calamities which ever befell} 
\stick{the republick of letters, That those who} 
\stick{have been entrusted with the education} 
\stick{of our children, and whose business it} 
\stick{was to open their minds, and stock them} 
\stick{early with ideas, in order to set the ima-}
\stick{gination loose upon them, have made so} 
\stick{little use of the auxiliary verbs in doing} 
\stick{it, as they have done\tsh So that, ex-}\catch{cept} 
\stick{cept \textit{Raymond Lullius}, and the elder \textit{Pe}-}
\stick{\textit{legrini}, the last of which arrived to such}
\stick{perfection in the use of ’em, with his to-}
\stick{pics, that in a few lessons, he could}
\stick{teach a young gentleman to discourse} 
\stick{with plausibility upon any subject, \textit{pro}}
\stick{and \textit{con}, and to say and write all that} 
\stick{could be spoken or written concerning it,}
\stick{without blotting a word, to the admi-}
\stick{ration of all who beheld him.\tsk I should} 
\stick{be glad, said \textit{Yorick}, interrupting my}
\stick{father, to be made to comprehend this}
matter. You shall, said my father.

The highest stretch of improvement a\break
\stick{single word is capable of, is a high me-}
\stick{taphor,\tsh for which, in my opinion,} 
\stick{the idea is generally the worse, and not} 
\stick{the better;\tsh but be that as it may,}\catch{\tsk when} 
\stick{\tsk when the mind has done that with it}
\stick{\tsk there is an end,\tsk the mind and the}
\stick{idea are at rest,\tsk until a second idea en-}
ters;\tsk and so on.

Now the use of the \textit{Auxiliaries} is, at\break
\stick{once to set the soul a going by herself}
\stick{upon the materials as they are brought} 
\stick{her; and by the versability of this great}
\stick{engine, round which they are twisted,}
\stick{to open new tracts of enquiry, and make}
every idea engender millions.

You excite my curiosity greatly, said\break
\textit{Yorick}.

For my own part, quoth my uncle\break
\stick{\toby, I have given it up.\tsh The \textit{Danes},}
\stick{an’ please your honour, quoth the cor-}\catch{poral,}
\stick{poral, who were on the left at the siege}
\stick{of \textit{Limerick}, were all auxiliaries.\tsh And} 
\stick{very good ones, said my uncle \toby.\tsk} 
\stick{But the auxiliaries, \trim, my brother} 
\stick{is talking about,\tsk I conceive to be diffe-}
rent things.\tsh

\tsh Yo\sic do? said my father, rising\break up.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  XLIII.}

\dropcap{M}{y} father took a single turn across\break
the room, then sat down and fi-\break
nished the chapter.

The verbs auxiliary we are concerned\break
in here, continued my father, are, \textit{am};
\stck{\textit{was}; \textit{have}; \textit{had}; \textit{do}; \textit{did}; \textit{make}; \textit{made}; \textit{suf-}}\catch{\textit{fer};}
\stck{\textit{fer}; \textit{shall}; \textit{should}; \textit{will}; \textit{would}; \textit{can}; \textit{could};} 
\stick{\textit{owe}; \textit{ought}; \textit{used}; or \textit{is wont}.\tsk And these} 
\stck{varied with tenses, \textit{present}, \textit{past}, \textit{future}, and}
\stick{conjugated with the verb \textit{see},\tsk or with} 
\stick{these questions added to them;\tsk \textit{Is it?}}
\stick{\textit{Was it? Will it be? Would it be? May}}
\stick{\textit{it be? Might it be?} And these again}
\stick{put negatively, \textit{Is it not? Was it not?}}
\stick{\textit{Ought it not?}\tsk Or affirmatively,\tsk \textit{It is};}
\stick{\textit{It was}; \textit{It ought to be}. Or chronologi-}
\stick{cally,\tsk \textit{Has it been always? Lately?}}
\stick{\textit{How long ago?}\tsk Or hypothetically,\tsk \textit{If}}
\stick{\textit{it was}; \textit{If it was not?} What would}
\stick{follow?\tsh If the \textit{French} should beat}
\stick{the \textit{English?} If the \textit{Sun} go out of the}
\textit{Zodiac?}

Now, by the right use and application\break
\stick{of these, continued my father, in which}\catch{a}
\stick{a child’s memory should be exercised,} 
\stick{there is no one idea can enter his brain}
\stick{how barren soever, but a magazine of} 
\stick{conceptions and conclusions may be}
\stick{drawn forth from it.\tsh Did’st thou e-}
\stick{ver see a white bear? cried my father,}
\stick{turning his head round to \trim, who}
\stick{stood at the back of his chair:\tsk No,}
\stick{an’ please your honour, replied the cor-}
\stick{poral.\tsh But thou couldst discourse}
\stick{about one, \trim, said my father, in}
\stick{case of need?\tsh How is it possible,}
\stick{brother, quoth my uncle \toby, if the}
\stick{corporal never saw one?\tsh ’Tis the}
\stick{fact I want; replied my father,\tsk and}
the possibility of it, is as follows.

A \textscl{white bear}! Very well.  Have\break
\stick{I ever seen one? Might I ever have seen}\catch{one?}
\stick{one? Am I ever to see one? Ought}
\stick{I ever to have seen one? Or can I ever}
see one?

Would I had seen a white bear? (for\break
how can I imagine it?)

If I should see a white bear, what\break 
\stick{should I say? If I should never see a} 
white bear, what then?

If I never have, can, must, or shall\break
\stick{see a white bear alive; have I ever seen} 
\stick{the skin of one? Did I ever see one}
\stick{painted?\tsk described? Have I never} 
dreamed of one?

Did my father, mother, uncle, aunt,\break
\stick{brothers or sisters, ever see a white bear?}\catch{What} 
\stick{What would they give? How would}
\stick{they behave? How would the white}
\stick{bear have behaved? Is he wild?}
Tame? Terrible? Rough? Smooth?

\tsk Is the white bear worth seeing?\tsk

\tsk Is there no sin in it?\tsk

Is it better than a \textscl{black one}?
