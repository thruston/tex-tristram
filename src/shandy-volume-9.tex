to dedicate \textit{The Amours of my}
\textit{uncle Toby} to Mr.\@ \astw3 \tsh I see
more reasons, \textit{a posteriori}, for doing
it to Lord \astw7.

I should lament from my soul, if
this exposed me to the jealousy of
their Reverences; because, \textit{a posteri}-\catch{\textit{ori,}}
\textit{riori}\sic,
in Court-latin, signifies, the\break
kissing hands for preferment\tsk or\break
any thing else\tsk in order to get it.

My opinion of Lord \astw7 is\break
neither better nor worse, than it was
of Mr.\@ \astw3.  Honours, like im-\break
pressions upon coin, may give an\break
ideal and local value to a bit of base
metal; but Gold and Silver will pass
all the world over without any\break 
other recommendation than their\break 
own weight.

The same good will that made me 
think of offering up half an hour’s
amusement to Mr.\@ \astw3 when out of
place\tsk operates more forcibly at\catch{present,}
present, as half an hour’s amusement
will be more serviceable and 
refreshing after labour and sorrow,
than after a philosophical repast.

Nothing is so perfectly \textit{Amuse-\break ment}
as a total change of ideas; no
ideas are so totally different as those
of Ministers, and innocent Lovers:
for which reason, when I come to 
talk of Statesmen and Patriots, and 
set such marks upon them as will
prevent confusion and mistakes concerning 
them for the future\tsk I propose
to dedicate that Volume to some
gentle Shepherd,

\initial{I}{\ls{CALL}} all the powers of time and
chance, which severally check us in our careers in this world, to
bear me witness, that I could never yet get fairly to my uncle
Toby’s amours, till this very moment, that my
mother’s \textit{curiosity},\catch{as} as she stated the
affair,\tsk\tsk or a different impulse in her, as my father
would have it\tsh wished her to take a peep at them
through the key-hole.

\lqq Call it, my dear, by its right name, quoth my
father, and look through the key-hole as long as you
will.”

Nothing but the fermentation of that
\stick{little subacid humour, which I have often}
spoken of, in my father’s habit, could
have vented such an insinuation\tsh he was however frank
and generous in his nature, and at all times open to conviction; so
that he had scarce got to the 
\stick{last word of this ungracious retort, when}\break
his conscience smote him.\patch{My}

My mother was then conjugally 
\stick{swinging with her left arm twisted under}
\stick{his right, in such wise, that the inside of}
\stick{her hand rested upon the back of his\tsk}
\stick{she raised her fingers, and let them fall\tsk}
\stick{it could scarce be call’d a tap; or if it}
\stick{was a tap\tsh ’twould have puzzled a}
\stick{casuist to say, whether ’twas a tap of re-}
\stick{monstrance, or a tap of confession: my}
\stck{father, who was all sensibilities from head}
\stick{to foot, class’d it right\tsk Conscience re-}
\stick{doubled her blow\tsk he turn’d his face}
\stick{suddenly the other way, and my mother}
\stick{supposing his body was about to turn}
\stick{with it in order to move homewards,}
\stick{by a cross movement of her right leg,}
\stick{keeping her left as its centre, brought}
\stick{herself so far in front, that as he turned}\catch{his}
his head, he met her eye\tsh Confusion again! he saw a thousand reasons to wipe out
the reproach, and as many to reproach himself\tsh a thin, blue, chill, pellucid
chrystal with all its humours so at rest, the least mote or speck of desire might
have been seen, at the bottom of it, had it existed\tsh it did not\tsh and how I
happen to be so lewd myself, particularly a little before the vernal and\break
autumnal equinoxes\tsh Heaven above\break knows\tsh My mother\tsh madam\break\tsh
was so at no time, either by nature, by institution, or example.

A temperate current of blood ran orderly through her veins in
all months of the year, and in all critical moments both\catch{of}
of the day and night alike; nor did she superinduce the least heat into her humours
from the manual effervescencies of devotional tracts, which having little or no
meaning in them, nature is oft times obliged to find one\tsh And as for my father’s
example!  ’twas so far from being either aiding or abetting thereunto, that ’twas
the whole business of his life, to keep all fancies of that kind out of\break
\stick{her head \tsh Nature had done her part,}
\stck{to have spared him this trouble; and what}
\stick{was not a little inconsistent, my father} 
\stick{knew it\tsh And here am I sitting, this}
12th day of
August, 1766, in a purple jerkin and yellow pair of slippers, without either
wig or cap on, a most\catch{tragi-} tragicomical completion of his predic-\break
\stick{tion, \lqq That I should neither think,} 
\stick{\lqq nor act like any other man’s child,}
\stick{\lqq upon that very account.”\hfill}

The mistake of my father, was in\break attacking my mother’s
motive, instead of the act itself; for certainly key-holes were
made for other purposes; and\break 
considering the act, as an act which\break
interfered with a true proposition, and\break
denied a key-hole to be what it was\break
\tsh it became a violation of nature; and was
so far, you see, criminal.

It is for this reason, an’ please your Reverences, That key-holes are\catch{the}
the occasions of more sin and wickedness, than all other holes in this world put
together.

\tsh which leads me to my uncle Toby’s
amours.

\dropcap{T}{hough} the Corporal had been as good
as his word in putting my uncle Toby’s great
ramallie-wig into pipes, yet the time was too short to produce any
great effects from it: it had lain many years squeezed up in the
corner of his old campaign trunk; and as bad forms are not so easy
to be got the better of, and the use of candle-ends not so well
understood, it was not so pliable a business as one would have
wished. The Corporal with cheary eye and both arms extended, had
fallen back perpendicular from it a score times, to inspire it, if
possible, with a better air\tsh had \textsc{spleen}
given a look at it,\catch{’twould}
’twould have cost her ladyship a
smile\break\tsh it curl’d every where but where the
Corporal would have it; and where a buckle or two, in his opinion,
would have done it honour, he could as soon have raised the
dead.\etp

Such it was\tsh or rather such would it have
seem’d upon any other brow; but the sweet look of goodness
which sat upon my uncle Toby’s, assimilated every
thing around it so sovereignly to itself, and Nature had moreover
wrote\break\textsc{Gentleman} with so fair a hand in every line of
his countenance, that even his\break tarnish’d gold laced hat and
huge cock\-ade of flimsy taffeta became him; and though not worth a
button in themselves, yet the moment my uncle Toby put them
on, they became serious objects,\catch{and}
\stck{and altogether seem’d to have been picked} 
up by the hand of Science to set him off to
advantage.

\etp

Nothing in this world could have co-operated more powerfully
towards this, than my uncle Toby’s blue and
gold\tsh\break 
\stick{\itshape had not Quantity in some measure been ne-} 
\textit{cessary to Grace :} in a period of fifteen or sixteen years
since they had been made, by a total inactivity in my uncle
Toby’s life, for he seldom went further than the
bowling-green\tsk his blue and gold had become so miserably too
strait for him, that it was with the utmost difficulty the Corporal
was able to get him into them; the taking them up at the sleeves,
was\break
\stick{of no advantage.\tsk\ They were laced} however down the
back, and at the seams of the sides, \&c.\@ in the mode of King\catch{William’s}
William’s reign; and to shorten all description, they
shone so bright against the sun that morning, and had so metallick
and doughty an air with them, that had my uncle Toby thought
of attacking in armour, nothing could have so well imposed upon his
imagination.

As for the thin scarlet breeches, they had been unripp’d
by the taylor between the legs, and left at \textit{sixes and
sevens}\tsh

\tsh Yes, Madam,\tsh but let us govern our
fancies. It is enough they were held impracticable the night
before, and as there was no alternative in my uncle
Toby’s wardrobe, he sallied forth in the red
plush.\etp

The Corporal had array’d himself in poor \hbox{Le\, Fevre’s}
regimental coat; and\catch{with} with his hair tuck’d up under
his Mon\-tero-cap, which he had furbish’d up for the occasion,
march’d three paces distant from his master: a whiff of military
pride had puff’d out his shirt at the wrist; and upon that in a
black leather thong clipp’d into a tassel beyond the knot, hung
the Corporal’s stick\tsh\break My uncle Toby carried his cane
like a pike.

\tsh It looks well at least; quoth my father to
himself.

\dropcap[findent=2pt]{M}{y} uncle Toby turn’d his
head more than once behind him, to see how he was supported by the
Corporal; and the corporal as oft as he did it, gave a slight
flourish with his stick\tsk but not vapouringly; and with the
sweetest accent of most respectful encouragement, bid his honour
\lqq never fear.”

Now my uncle Toby did fear; and grievously too; he knew
not (as my father had reproach’d him) so much as the right
end of a Woman from the wrong, and therefore was never altogether
at his ease near any one of them\tsh unless in
sorrow or distress; then infinite was his pity; nor would the most
courteous\etp\catch{knight} knight of romance have gone further, at least upon one
leg, to have wiped away a tear from a woman’s eye; and yet
excepting once that he was beguiled into it by Mrs.\@ Wadman,
he had never looked stedfastly into one; and would often tell my
father in the simplicity of his heart, that it was almost (if not
alout) as bad as talking bawdy.\tsh

twenty paces of Mrs.\@ Wadman’s door\tsk she cannot,
Corporal, take it amiss.\tsh

\tsh She will take it, an’ please your honour,
said the Corporal, just as the Jew’s widow at
Lisbon took it of my brother Tom.\tsh

\tsh And how was that? quoth my\break uncle Toby,
facing quite about to the\break Corporal.

Your honour, replied the Corporal, knows of Tom’s
misfortunes; but this\catch{affair} affair has nothing to do with them any
further than this, That if Tom had not married the
widow\tsk or had it pleased God after their marriage, that
they had but put pork into their sausages, the honest soul had
never been taken out of his warm bed, and dragg’d to the
inquisition\tsk ’Tis a cursed place\tsk\break
\stick{added the Corporal, shaking his head,}
\tsk when once a poor creature is in,
he is in, an’ please your honour, for ever.

’Tis very true; said my uncle Toby looking gravely
at Mrs.\@ Wadman’s house, as he spoke.

Nothing, continued the Corporal, can be so sad as confinement
for life\tsk or so sweet, an’ please your honour, as
liberty.\patch{Nothing}

A thousand of my father’s most subtle syllogisms could not have said more
for celibacy.


My uncle Toby look’d earnestly towards his cottage
and his bowling green.

The Corporal had unwarily conjured
\stick{up the Spirit of calculation with his} 
\stick{wand; and he had nothing to do, but}
\stick{to conjure him down again with his}
\stick{story, and in this form of Exorcism,}

\dropcap[findent=0pt]{A}{s} Tom’s place, an’ please your\break
honour, was easy\tsk and the wea-\break 
ther warm\tsk it put him upon thinking se-\break
riously of
settling himself in the world; and as it fell out about that time, that a Jew who
kept a sausage shop in the same street, had the ill luck to die of a strangury, and
leave his widow in possession of a rousing trade\tsh Tom thought (as every body in
Lisbon was doing the best he could devise for himself) there could be no harm in
offering her his service to carry it on: so without any introduction to the widow,
except that of buying a pound of sausages at her shop\tsk Tom set out\tsk counting
the matter thus within\etp\catch{himself,} himself, as he walk’d along; that let the
worst come of it that could, he should at least get a pound of sausages for their
worth\tsk but, if things went well, he should be set up; inasmuch as he should get
not only a pound of sausages\tsk but a wife\tsk and a sausage-shop, an’ please your
honour, into the bargain.

Every servant in the family, from high to low, wish’d Tom success; and I can fancy,
an’ please your honour, I see him this moment with his white dimity waist-coat and
breeches, and hat a little o’\thinspace one side, passing jollily along the street, swinging
his stick, with a smile and a chearful word for every body he met:\break\tsh But alas!
Tom!  thou smilest no more, cried the Corporal, looking on\catch{one} one side of him upon the
ground, as if he apostrophized him in his dungeon.

Poor fellow! said my uncle Toby, feelingly.

He was an honest, light-hearted lad, an’ please your honour, as ever blood warm’d
\tsh

\tsh Then he resembled thee, Trim, said my uncle Toby, rapidly.

The Corporal blush’d down to his fingers ends\tsk a tear of sentimental
bashfulness\tsk another of gratitude to my uncle Toby\tsk and a tear of sorrow for
his brother’s misfortunes, started into his eye, and ran sweetly down his cheek
together; my uncle Toby’s kindled as one\catch{lamp} lamp does at another; and
taking hold of the breast of Trim’s coat (which had been that of Le Fevre’s) as if
to\break ease his lame leg, but in reality to gratify a finer feeling\tsh he stood
silent for\break a minute and a half; at the end of which he took his hand away, and
the Corporal making a bow, went on with his story of his brother and the Jew’s
widow.

\dropcap{W}{hen} Tom, an’ please
your ho\-nour, got to the shop, there was\break
\stick{nobody in it, but a poor negro girl, with}
\stick{a bunch of white feathers slightly tied to}
\stick{the end of a long cane, flapping away}
\stick{flies\tsk not killing them.\tsh ’Tis a pretty}
\stick{picture! said my uncle Toby\tsk she had}
\stck{suffered persecution, Trim, and had learnt}
mercy\tsh

\tsh She was good, an’ please your honour, from
nature, as well as from hardships; and there are circumstances in
the story of that poor friendless slut, that would melt a heart of
stone, said Trim; and some dismal winter’s evening,
when your honour is in the humour, they\etp\catch{shall} shall be told you with the
rest of Tom’s story, for it makes a part of
it\tsh

Then do not forget, Trim, said my uncle Toby.

A Negro has a soul? an’ please your honour, said the
Corporal (doubtingly).

\noindent
\stick{\hfill I am not much versed, Corporal, quoth}
\stick{my uncle Toby, in things of that kind;} 
but I suppose, God would not leave him without
one, any more than thee or me\tsh

\noindent
\stick{\hfill \tsh It would be putting one sadly}
\stick{over the head of another, quoth the}
Corporal.\patch{It}

It would so; said my uncle Toby.\break
Why then, an’ please your honour, is a\break
black wench to be used worse than a\break
white one?

I can give no reason, said my uncle
Toby\tsh

\tsh Only, cried the Corporal, shaking his head,
because she has no one to stand up for her\tsh

\noindent
\stick{\hfill \tsh ’Tis that very thing, Trim, quoth}
\stick{my uncle Toby,\tsh which recommends}
\stick{her to protection\tsh and her brethren}
\stick{with her; ’tis the fortune of war which}
\stick{has put the whip into our hands \textit{now}\tsh}
\stick{where it may be hereafter, heaven}
\stick{knows!\tsh but be it where it will,}\catch{the}
\stick{the brave, Trim! will not use it un-}
kindly.

\tsh God forbid, said the Corporal.

Amen, responded my uncle Toby,\break
laying his hand upon his heart.

The Corporal returned to his story, and went on\tsh but with an embar\-rassment in
doing it, which here and there a reader in this world will not be able to
comprehend; for by the many sudden transitions all along, from one kind and cordial
passion to another, in getting thus far on his way, he had lost the sportable key of
his voice, which gave sense and spirit to his tale: he attempted twice to resume it,
but could\catch{not} not please himself; so giving a stout hem! to rally back the retreating
spirits, and aiding Nature at the same time with his left arm a-kimbo on one side,
and with his right a little extended, supporting her on the other\tsk the Corporal got
as near the note as he could; and in that attitude, continued his story.

\dropcap[findent=0pt]{A}{s} Tom, an’ please your honour,\break had no business at that time with the
Moorish girl, he passed on into the room beyond, to talk to the Jew’s widow
about love\tsh and this pound of sausages; and being, as I have told your
honour,\break
an open cheary hearted lad, with his character wrote in his looks and carriage, he
took a chair, and without much apology, but with great civility at the same time,
placed it close to her at the table, and sat down.

There is nothing so awkward, as courting a woman, an’
please your honour, whilst she is making sausages\tsh\break
So Tom began a discourse upon them;\etp\catch{first,}
\stick{first, gravely,\tsh \lqq as how they were}
\stick{\lqq made\tsh with what meats, herbs,}
\stick{\lqq and spices”\tsk Then a little gayly\tsk}
\stick{as, \lqq With what skins\tsh and if they}
\stick{\lqq never burst\tsh Whether the largest}
\stick{\lqq were not the best”\tsk and so on\tsk}
taking care only as he went along, to season what he had to say upon sausages,
rather under than over;\tsh that he might have room to act in\tsh

\noindent
\stick{\hfill It was owing to the neglect of that very}
\stick{precaution, said my uncle Toby, laying}
\stick{his hand upon Trim’s shoulder, That}
Count de la Motte lost the battle of Wynendale: he
pressed too speedily into the wood; which if he had not done, Lisle had not fallen
into our hands, nor Ghent and Bruges, which both followed\catch{her} her example; it was so
late in the year, continued my uncle Toby, and so terrible a season came on, that if
things had not fallen out as they did, our troops must have perished in the open
field.\tsh

\tsh Why, therefore, may not battles, an’ please
your honour, as well as marriages, be made in heaven?\tsk My
uncle Toby mused.\tsh

Religion inclined him to say one thing, and his high idea of
military skill tempted him to say another; so not being able to
frame a reply exactly to his mind\break\tsh my uncle Toby
said nothing at\break all; and the Corporal finished his\break story.\patch{As}

As Tom perceived, an’ please your honour, that he
gained ground, and that all he had said upon the subject of
sausages was kindly taken, he went on to help her a little in
making them.\tsh\break First, by taking hold of the ring of the
sausage whilst she stroked the forced meat down with her
hand\tsh then by cutting the strings into proper lengths,
and holding them in his hand, whilst she took them out one by
one\tsh then, by putting them across her mouth, that she might
take them out as she wanted\break
\stick{them\tsh and so on from little to more,}
\stick{till at last he adventured to tie the}
\stick{sausage himself, whilst she held the}
snout.\tsh\etp

\tsh Now a widow, an’ please your honour, always chuses a second husband\catch{as} as
unlike the first as she can: so the affair was more than half settled in her mind
before Tom mentioned it.

She made a feint however of defending herself, by snatching up a
sausage:\break\tsh Tom instantly laid hold of
another\tsh

But seeing Tom’s had more gristle in
it\tsh

She signed the capitulation\tsh and Tom sealed
it; and there was an end of the matter.

\dropcap[findent=0pt]{A}{ll} womankind, continued Trim,
(commenting upon his story) from the highest to the lowest, an’ please your honour,
love jokes; the difficulty is to know how they chuse to have them cut; 
\stick{and there is no knowing that, but by} 
trying, as we do with our artillery in the field, by raising or letting down their

I hope, Trim, answered my uncle Toby, I love mankind more than either; and as the
knowledge of arms tends so apparently to the good and quiet of the world\tsh and
particularly that branch of it which we have practised together in our

\textit{many}\break\tsh whenever that drum beats in our ears, I trust, Corporal, we shall
neither of us want so much humanity and fellow-feeling, as to face about and march.

they had got to the fatal angle of the old garden wall, where Doctor Slop was
overthrown by Obadiah on the coach-horse: as this was directly opposite to the front
of Mrs.\@ Wadman’s house, when my father came to it, he gave a look across; and
seeing my uncle Toby and the Corporal within ten paces of the\break

\tsh It will not detain us half a one; said my

The Corporal was just then setting in with the story of his brother Tom and the
Jew’s widow: the story went on\tsk\break and on\tsh it had episodes in it\tsh\break it came
back, and went on\tsh and on again; there was no end of it\tsh the reader found it

\tsh G\tsk\, help my father! he pish’d\break fifty
times at every new attitude, and gave the corporal’s stick,
with all its flourishings and danglings, to as many devils as chose
to accept of them.\patch{When}

When issues of events like these my father is waiting for, are
hanging in the scales of fate, the mind has the advantage of
changing the principle of expectation three times, without which it
would not have power to see it out.

Curiosity governs the \textit{first moment}; and the second moment is all œconomy to
justify the expence of the first\tsh\break and for the third, fourth, fifth, and
sixth moments, and so on to the day of judgment\tsk ’tis a point of \textsc{Honour}.

I need not be told, that the ethic writers have assigned this all to Patience; but
that \textsc{Virtue} methinks, has extent of dominion sufficient of her own, and
enough to do in it, without invading the\catch{few} few dismantled castles which
\textsc{Honour} has left him upon the earth.

My father stood it out as well as he could with these three auxiliaries to the end
of Trim’s story; and from thence to the end of my uncle Toby’s panegyrick upon arms,
in the chapter following it; when seeing, that instead of marching up to Mrs.\@
Wadman’s door, they both faced about and march’d down the ave\-nue diametrically
opposite to his expectation\tsk he broke out at once with that little subacid soreness
of humour which, in certain situations, distinguished his cha\-racter from that of
all other men.

\dropcap{U}{pon} looking back from the end\break of the last chapter, and surveying
the texture of what has been wrote, it is necessary, that upon this page and the
five following, a good quantity of hete\-rogeneous matter be inserted, to keep up that
just balance betwixt wisdom and folly, without which a book would not
\stick{hold together
a single year: nor is it a} poor creeping digression (which but for the name of, a
man might continue as well going on in the king’s highway) which will do the
business\tsh no; if it is to be a digression, it must be a good frisky one, and
upon a frisky subject too, where neither the horse or his rider are to be caught,
but by rebound.\etp\patch{The}

The only difficulty, is raising powers suitable to the nature of the service:
\textsc{Fancy} is capricious\tsk \textsc{Wit} must not be searched for\tsk and
\textsc{Pleasantry} (good-natured slut as she is) will not come in at a call, was an
empire to be laid at her feet.

\tsh The best way for a man, is to say his prayers\tsh

Only if it puts him in mind of his in\-firmities and defects as
well ghostly as bodily\tsk for that purpose, he will find himself
rather worse after he has said them than before\tsk for other
purposes, better.

For my own part, there is not a way either moral or mechanical
under heaven\catch{that} that I could think of, which I have not taken with
myself in this case: sometimes by addressing myself directly to the
soul herself, and arguing the point over and over again with her
upon the extent of her own faculties\tsh

\tsh I never could make them an inch the
wider\tsh

Then by changing my system, and trying what could be made of it
upon
\stick{the body, by temperance, soberness, and}
\stck{chastity: These are good, quoth I, in them-}
selves\tsk they are good,
absolutely;\tsk they are good, relatively;\tsk they are good
for health\tsk they are good for happiness in this
world\tsk they are good for happiness in the
next\tsh\patch{In}

In short, they were good for every thing but the thing wanted;
and there they were good for nothing, but to leave the soul just as
heaven made it: as for the theological virtues of faith and hope,
they give it courage; but then that snive\-ling virtue of Meekness
(as my father would always call it) takes it quite away again, so
you are exactly where you started.

\stick{\hfill \tight{Now in all common and ordinary cases,}}
there is nothing which I
have found to answer so well as this\tsh

\etpp
\tsh Certainly, if there is any depend\-ence upon Logic, and that I am not

\stick{something of true genius about me,}

\dropcap{N}{ow} in ordinary cases, that is, when
I am only stupid, and the thoughts rise heavily and pass gummous
through my pen\tsh

Or that I am got, I know not how, into a cold unmetaphorical vein of infamous
writing, and cannot take a plumb-lift out of it \textit{for my soul}; so must be
obliged to go on writing like a Dutch commentator to the end of
the chapter,\break unless
something be done\tsh

\tsh I never stand conferring with pen and ink one moment; for if a pinch of snuff
or a stride or two across the room will not do the business for me\tsk I take a razor
at once; and having tried the edge\etp\catch{of} of it upon the palm of my hand, without
further ceremony, except that of first lathering my beard, I shave it off; taking
care only if I do leave a hair, that it be not a grey one: this done, I change my
shirt\tsk put on a better coat\tsk send for my last wig\tsk put my topaz ring upon my
finger; and in a word, dress myself from one end to the other of me, after my best
fashion.

Now the devil in hell must be in it, if this does not do: for consider, Sir, as
every man chuses to be present at the shaving of his own beard (though there is no
rule without an exception), and unavoidably sits overagainst himself the whole time
it is doing, in case he has a hand in it\tsk the Situation, like all others,\catch{has} has
notions of her own to put into the brain.\tsh

\tsh I maintain it, the conceits of a rough-bearded
man, are seven years more terse and juvenile for one single
operation; and if they did not run a risk of being quite shaved
away, might be carried up by continual shavings, to the highest
pitch of sublimity\tsk How Homer could write with so long
a beard, I don’t know\tsh and as it makes against my
hypothesis, I as little care\tsh But let us return to the
Toilet.

Ludovicus Sorbonensis makes this entirely an affair of the body (εξωτερικη πραξις)
as he calls it\tsh but he is deceived: the soul and body are joint-\catch{sharers} sharers in
every thing they get: A man cannot dress, but his ideas get cloath’d at the same
time; and if he dresses like a gentleman, every one of them stands presented to his
imagination, genteelized along with him\tsk so that he has nothing to do, but take his
pen, and write like himself.

For this cause, when your honours and reverences would know whether I writ clean and
fit to be read, you will be able to judge full as well by looking into my
Laundress’s bill, as my book: there is one single month in which I can make it
appear, that I dirtied one 
\stick{and thirty shirts with clean writing; and}
\stick{after all, was more abus’d, curs’d, cri-}
ticis’d and confounded, and had more\catch{mystic} mystic heads shaken at
me, for what I had wrote in that one month, than in all the other months of that
year put together.

safest way is to follow the tract of the\catch{learned,} learned, and raise
objections against what I have been writing, tho’ I declare
before-hand, I know no more than my heels how to answer them.

And first, it may be said, there is a pelting kind of
\textit{thersitical} satire, as black as the very ink ’tis
wrote with\tsh (and by the bye, whoever says so, is
indebted to the muster-master general of the Gre-
\stick{cian army, for suffering the name of}
\stick{so ugly and foul-mouth’d a man as}
\stick{\textit{Thersites} to continue upon his roll\tsh}
for it has
furnish’d him with an epithet)\break\tsh in these
productions he will urge, all the personal washings and scrubbings
upon earth do a sinking genius no sort of good\tsh but
just the contrary, inas-\catch{much} much as the dirtier the fellow is, the\break
better generally he succeeds in it.

To this, I have no other answer\tsh\break at least
ready\tsk\tsk but that the Archbishop of Benevento
wrote his \textit{nasty} Romance of the Galatea, as all the
world knows, in a purple coat, waistcoat, and purple pair of
breeches; and that the penance set him of writing a commentary upon
the book of the Revelations, as severe as it was
look’d upon by one part of the world, was far from being
deem’d so, by the other, upon the single\break account of that
\textit{Investment}.

Another objection, to all this remedy, is its want of
universality; forasmuch as the shaving part of it, upon which so\catch{much}
much stress is laid, by an unalterable law of nature excludes one
half of the species entirely from its use: all I can say is,
\stick{that female writers, whether of England,}
\stick{or of France, must e’en go without}
it\tsh

departure\tsk and besides, my dear Sir, you get a sisterly kiss
of each of ’em worth a pound\tsh\break at least I
did\tsh

\tsh For my uncle Toby’s amours running all the way in my head, they had the same
effect upon me as if they had been my own\tsh I was in the most perfect state of
bounty and good-will; and felt the kindliest harmony vibrating within me, with every
oscillation of the chaise alike; so that whether the roads\catch{were} were rough or smooth,
it made no difference; every thing I saw, or had to do with, touch’d upon some secret
spring either of sentiment or rapture.

\tsh They were the sweetest notes I ever heard; and I instantly let down the
fore-glass to hear them more distinctly\break\tsh ’Tis Maria; said the
postillion,\break
observing I was listening\tsh Poor\break
Maria, continued he, (leaning his body on one
side to let me see her, for he was in a line betwixt us), is sitting upon a bank
playing her vespers upon her pipe, with her little goat beside her.

The young fellow utter’d this with an accent and a look so
perfectly in tune to a feeling heart, that I instantly made a\catch{vow,} vow,
I would give him a four and twenty sous piece, when I got to
\textit{Moulins}\tsh

\tsh And who is \textit{poor Maria\;?}\break said~I.

The love and piety of all the villages around us; said the
postillion\tsh it is\break but three years ago, that the sun did
not shine upon so fair, so quick-witted and amiable a maid; and
better fate did \textit{Maria} deserve, than to have her Banns
forbid, by the intrigues of the curate of the parish who published
them\tsh

He was going on, when Maria, who had made a short pause,
put the pipe to her mouth and began the air
again\catch{\tsk\tsk they} \tsh they were the same notes;\tsh yet were
ten times sweeter: It is the evening service to the Virgin, said
the young\break man\tsh but who has taught her to play
it\tsk or how she came by her pipe, no one knows; we think that
Heaven has assisted her in both; for ever since she has been
unsettled in her mind, it seems her only
consolation\tsh she has never once had the pipe out of her
hand, but plays that \textit{service} upon it almost night and
day.

The postillion delivered this with so much discretion and natural eloquence, that I
could not help decyphering something in his face above his condition, and should
have sifted out his history,\catch{had} had not poor Maria's taken such full\break
possession of me.

We had got up by this time almost to the bank where Maria
was sitting:\break she was in a thin white jacket with her hair, all but
two tresses, drawn up into a silk net, with a few olive leaves
twisted a little fantastically on one side\tsh she was
beautiful; and if ever I felt the full force of an honest
heart-ache, it was the moment I saw her\tsh

\noindent
\stick{\indent \tsh God help her! poor damsel!}
\stick{above a hundred masses, said the postil-}
\stick{lion, have been said in the several parish}
\stick{churches and convents around, for her,}
\stick{\tsh but without effect; we have still} 
\stick{\tight{hopes, as she is sensible for short intervals,}}\catch{that}
that the Virgin at last will restore her to herself; but her parents, who know her
best, are hopeless upon that score, and think her senses are lost for ever.

As the postillion spoke this, \textsc{Maria} made a
cadence so melancholy, so tender and querulous, that I sprung out
of the chaise to help her, and found myself sitting betwixt
her and her goat before I relapsed from my enthusiasm.

\textsc{Maria} look’d wistfully for some time at me,
and then at her goat\tsh and\break then at me\tsh and
then at her goat\break again, and so on, alternately\tsh

\tsh Well, Maria, said I
softly\tsh What resemblance do you find?\patch{I do}

I do intreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from
the humblest conviction of what a \textit{Beast} man
is,\tsh that I ask’d the question; and that I would not
have let fallen an unseasonable pleasantry in the venerable
presence of Misery, to be entitled to all the wit that ever
Rabelais scatter’d\tsh and yet I own my heart
smote me, and that I so smarted at the very idea of it, that I
swore I would set up for Wisdom and utter grave sentences the rest
of my days\tsh and never\tsh\break never attempt again
to commit mirth with man, woman, or child, the longest day I had to
live.

As for writing nonsense to them\tsh\break I believe, there was
a reserve\tsk but that\break I leave to the world.\patch{Adieu,}

Adieu, Maria!\tsk adieu, poor hapless
damsel!\tsh some time, but not \textit{now}, I may hear thy sorrows
from thy own lips\break\tsh but I was deceived; for that moment
she took her pipe and told me such a tale of woe with it, that I
rose up, and with broken and irregular steps walk’d softly to
my chaise.

\dropcap[findent=0pt]{A}{s} Mrs.\@ Bridget open’d the
door\break before the Corporal had well given the rap, the interval
betwixt that and\break my uncle Toby’s introduction into the
parlour, was so short, that Mrs.\@ Wadman had but just time to
get from behind the curtain\tsh lay a Bible upon the
table, and advance a step or two towards the door to receive
him.

My uncle Toby saluted Mrs.\@ Wad-\break man, after the
manner in which women were saluted by men in the year of our Lord
God one thousand seven hundred and thirteen\tsh then
facing about, he march’d up abreast with her to the\catch{sopha,} sopha,
and in three plain words\tsk\tsk\break 
though not before he was sat down\tsh\break
nor after he was sat down\tsh\break but as he
was sitting down, told her,\break 
\lqq \textit{he was in love}”\tsh so that my uncle Toby strained
himself more in the declaration than he needed.

Mrs.\@ Wadman naturally looked down, upon a slit she had
been darning up in her apron, in expectation every moment, that my
uncle Toby would go on; but having no talents for
amplification, and \ls{\textsc{Love}} moreover of all others being a\break subject of
which he was the least a master\tsh When he had told 
Mrs.\@ Wadman once that he loved her, he let it alone, and left the
matter to work after\break its own way.\patch{My}

My father was always in raptures with this system of my uncle
Toby’s, as he falsely called it, and would often say,
that could his brother Toby to his processe have added but a
pipe of tobacco\tsh \break he had wherewithal to have found his
way, if there was faith in a Spanish proverb, towards the
hearts of half the women upon the globe.

My uncle Toby never understood what my father meant; nor
will I presume to extract more from it, than a\break
\stick{condemnation of an error which the}
\stick{bulk of the world lie under\tsh but the}
\stick{French, every one of ’em to a man,}
\stick{who believe in it, almost as much as}
\stick{the \ls{\textsc{real presence}}, \lqq \textit{That talking of}} 
\stick{\lqq \textit{love, is making it}.\,”\hfill}\patch{\tsh I}

\tsh I would as soon set about\break
making a black-pudding by the same\break
receipt.

Let us go on: Mrs.\@ Wadman sat in\break
\stick{expectation my uncle Toby would do so,} 
\stick{to almost the first pulsation of that mi-}
\stick{nute, wherein silence on one side or}
the other, generally becomes
indecent: so edging herself a little more towards him, and raising
up her eyes, sub-blushing, as she did it\tsh she took up
the gauntlet\tsh or the discourse (if you like it better)
and communed with my uncle Toby, thus.

The cares and disquietudes of the marriage state, quoth Mrs.\@ Wadman,\catch{are} are very
great. I suppose so\tsk said my uncle Toby: and therefore when a person, continued
Mrs.\@ Wadman, is so much at his ease as you are\tsk so happy, captain
Shandy, in yourself, your friends and your amusements\tsk I wonder, what
reasons can incline you to the state\tsh


\tsh They are written, quoth my uncle Toby, in
the Common-Prayer Book.


Thus far my uncle Toby went on warily, and kept within
his depth, leaving Mrs.\@ Wadman to sail upon the gulph as she
pleased.

\etp
\tsk As for children\tsk said Mrs.\@ Wadman\tsk though a principal end perhaps of\break 
\stck{the institution, and the natural wish, I sup-}
\stick{pose, of every parent\tsk yet do not we all}
find, they are certain sorrows, and very\catch{uncertain} uncertain comforts? and what is there,
dear sir, to pay one for the heart-achs\tsk\break
what compensation for the many tender and
disquieting apprehensions of a suffering and defenceless mother who brings them into
life? I declare, said my uncle Toby, smit with pity, I know of none; unless it be
the pleasure which it has pleased God\tsh

\tsh A fiddlestick! quoth she.

\dropcap{N}{ow} there are such an infinitude of
notes, tunes, cants, chants, airs, looks, and accents with which
the word \textit{fiddlestick} may be pronounced in all
such causes as this, every one of ’em impressing a sense and
meaning as different from the other, as \textit{dirt} from
\textit{cleanliness}\break\tsk That Casuists (for it is an affair of
conscience on that score) reckon up no less than fourteen thousand
in which you may do either right or wrong.

Mrs.\@ Wadman hit upon the \textit{fiddlestick}, which
summoned up all my uncle Toby’s modest blood into his
cheeks\tsk so feeling within himself that he had somehow or other
got beyond his depth, he stopt\etp\catch{short;}
\stck{short; and without entering further either} 
into the pains or pleasures of matrimony, he laid his hand
upon his heart, and made an offer to take them as they were, and
share them along with her.

When my uncle Toby had said this, he did not care to say
it again; so casting his eye upon the Bible which 
Mrs.\@ Wadman had laid upon the table, he took it up; and popping,
dear soul! upon a passage in it, of all others the most interesting
to him\tsk which was the siege of Jericho\tsk he set
himself to read it over\tsk leaving his proposal of marriage, as he had done his declaration of love, to work with
her after its own way. Now it wrought neither as an astringent or a
loosener; nor like opium, or bark, or mercury, or buckthorn, or any
one\etp\catch{drug} drug which nature had bestowed upon the world\tsk in short,
it work’d not at all in her; and the cause of that was, that
there was something working there before\tsh Babbler that
I am! I have anticipated what it was a dozen times; but there is
fire still in the subject\tsh\break allons.

\dropcap{I}{t} is natural for a perfect stranger

before he sets out, how many miles to York; which is\break
\stick{about the half way\tsh nor does any} 
body wonder, if he goes on
and asks about the Corporation, \&c.\@ - -

It was just as natural for Mrs.\@ Wadman, whose first
husband was all his time afflicted with a Sciatica, to wish to know
how far from the hip to the groin;\break and how far she was likely to suffer more or less in
her feelings, in the one case than in the other.

She had accordingly read \textit{Drake}’s anatomy from one end
to the other. She\etp\catch{had} had peeped into \textit{Wharton}

muscles; but could make nothing\break of it.

She had reason’d likewise from her own
powers\tsh laid down theorems\break\tsh drawn

\stick{Doctor Slop, \lqq if poor captain Shandy}

\tsh Quite: madam\tsh

But what do you mean by a recovery? Mrs.\@ Wadman would
say.

Doctor Slop was the worst man alive at definitions; and
so Mrs.\@ Wadman could get no knowledge: in short, there was
no way to extract it, but from my uncle Toby himself.

There is an accent of humanity in an enquiry of this kind which
lulls \textsc{Suspicion} to rest\tsh and I am half
persuaded the serpent got pretty near it, in his discourse with
Eve; for the propensity in the sex to be deceived could not be so

\tsk And whereabouts, dear sir, quoth Mrs.\@ Wadman, a
little categorically, did you receive this sad
blow?\tsk\ In asking this question, Mrs.\@ Wadman gave
a slight glance towards the waistband of my uncle
Toby’s red plush breeches, ex-\catch{pecting} pecting naturally, as the
shortest reply to it, that my uncle Toby would lay his
fore-finger upon the place\tsh It fell out
otherwise\tsh for my uncle Toby having got his wound before the gate of St.\@ Nicolas,
in one of the traverses of the trench, opposite to the salient angle
of the demi-bastion of St.\@ Roch ; he could at any time stick a
pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing when
the stone struck him : this struck instantly upon my uncle
Toby’s sensorium\tsh and with it, struck his

\stick{\tsh it had lain with other military lum-}

it.

My uncle Toby measured off thirty toises, with 
Mrs.\@ Wadman’s scissars, from the returning angle before the
gate of St.\@ Nicolas ; and with such a virgin modesty laid her
finger upon the place, that the goddess of Decency, if then in

Bridget’s eyes poured down at the sensations the

\tsh Tell me\tsh tell me then, my\break dear
Bridget, continued the Corporal, taking hold of her hand,
which hung\catch{down} down dead by her side,\tsh and giving a second
kiss\tsh whose suspicion has misled thee?

\dropcap[findent=2pt]{M}{y} uncle Toby and the Corporal
had gone on separately with their\break operations the greatest part of
the campaign, and as effectually cut off from all communication of
what either the one or the other had been doing, as if they had
been separated from each other by the \textit{Maes} or the
\textit{Sambre}.

My uncle Toby, on his side, had presented himself every
afternoon in his red and silver, and blue and gold alternately, and
sustained an infinity of attacks in them, without knowing them to
be attacks\tsk and so had nothing to
communicate\tsh\patch{The}

The Corporal, on his side, in taking Bridget, by it had
gain’d considerable\break advantages\tsk\tsk and consequently
had much to communicate\tsh but what were the
advantages\tsh as well, as what was the manner by which he
had seiz’d them, required so nice an historian that the
Corporal durst not venture upon it; and as sensible as he was of
glory, would rather have been contented to have gone barehead and
without laurels for ever, than torture his master’s modesty\break
for a single moment\tsh

\tsh Best of honest and gallant
servants!\tsh But I have apostrophiz’d thee,
Trim!\@ once before\tsh and could I apotheosize thee
also (that is to say)\catch{with} with good company\tsh I would do it

\dropcap{N}{ow} my uncle Toby had one
evening laid down his pipe upon\break 
the table, and was counting over to
himself upon his finger ends, (beginning at his thumb) all 
Mrs.\@ Wadman’s perfections one by one; and happening two or
three times together, either by omitting some, or counting
others twice over to puzzle himself sadly before he could get
beyond his middle finger\tsh Pri\-thee, Trim!\@ said
he, taking up his pipe\break 
again,\thinspace\tsh bring me a pen and ink:\break
Trim brought paper also.

\vfill\rightline{Take}\eject

Take a full sheet\tsh Trim! said my uncle
Toby, making a sign with his pipe at the same time to take a
chair and sit down close by him at the table. The Corporal
obeyed\tsh placed the paper directly before
him\tsh took a pen and dip’d it in the ink.

\tsk She has a thousand virtues, Trim! said my uncle
Toby\tsh

Am I to set them down, an’ please your honour? quoth the
Corporal.

\tsh But they must be taken in their ranks, replied my
uncle Toby; for of them all, Trim, that which wins me
most, and which is a security for all the rest, is the
compassionate turn and singu-\catch{lar} lar humanity of her character\tsk I
pro-\break test, added my uncle Toby, looking up, as he protested
it, towards the top of the ceiling\tsk That was I her brother, Trim, a
thousand fold, she could not make more constant or more tender
enquiries after my sufferings\tsh though\break now no more.

The Corporal made no reply to my\break uncle Toby’s protestation, but by a short
cough \tsk
he dip’d the pen a second time into the inkhorn; and my uncle Toby, pointing with
the end of his pipe as close to the top of the sheet at the left hand corner of it,
as he could get it\tsh the Corporal wrote down the word\\ 
\hbox to \textwidth{{\addfontfeature{LetterSpace=20}HUMANITY} -
- - - - - thus.}\patch{Prithee,}

Prithee, Corporal, said my uncle Toby, as soon as Trim had done it\tsh how often
does Mrs.\@ Bridget enquire after the wound on the cap of thy knee, which thou
received’st at the battle of\break Landen?

She never, an’ please your honour,\break enquires after it at all.

That, Corporal, said my uncle Toby, with all the triumph the goodness of his nature
would permit\tsh That shews the difference in the character of the mistress and
maid\tsh had the fortune of war allotted the same mischance to me, Mrs.\@ Wadman
would have enquired into every circumstance relating to it a\catch{hundred}
\stick{hundred times\tsh She would have en-}
\stick{quired, an’ please your honour, ten times}
\stick{as often about your honour’s groin\tsh}
\stick{The pain, Trim, is equally excruciating,}
\stick{\tsh and Compassion has as much to do} 
with the one as the other\tsh

\tsh God bless your honour! cried the
Corporal\tsh what has a woman’s compassion to do
with a wound upon the cap of a man’s knee? had your
honour’s been shot into ten thousand splinters at the affair
of Landen, Mrs.\@ Wadman would have troubled her head
as little about it as Bridget; because, added the Corporal,
lowering his voice, and speaking very distinctly, as he\break assigned
his reason\tsh\patch{\lqq The}

\stick{\indent\lqq The knee is such a distance from}
\stick{\lqq the main body\tsh whereas the groin,}
\stick{\lqq your honour knows, is upon the very}
\stick{\lqq \textit{curtin} of the \textit{place}.\,”\hfill}

My uncle Toby gave a long whistle\break\tsh but in a
note which could scarce be heard across the table.

The Corporal had advanced too far to retire\tsh in
three words he told the rest\tsh

My uncle Toby laid down his pipe\break
as gently upon the fender, as if it had\break
been spun from the unravellings of a\break
spider’s web\tsh

\tsh Let us go to my brother\break Shandy’s,
said he.

\dropcap{T}{here} will be just time, whilst\break my
uncle Toby and Trim are walking to my father’s,
to inform you,\break
\stick{that Mrs.\@ Wadman had, some moons} before this,
made a confident of my mother; and that Mrs.\@ Bridget, who
had the burden of her own, as well as her mistress’s secret
to carry, had got happily delivered of both to Susannah
behind the garden-wall.

As for my mother, she saw nothing at all in it, to make the
least bustle about\break\tsh but Susannah was sufficient
by herself for all the ends and purposes you could possibly have,
in exporting a fa-\catch{mily} mily secret; for she instantly imparted it by
signs to Jonathan\tsh and Jonathan by tokens
to the cook, as she was basting a loin of mutton; the cook sold it
with some kitchen-fat to the postillion for a groat, who
truck’d it with the dairy maid for something of about the
same value\tsh and though whisper’d in the hay-loft,
\ls{\textsc{Fame}} caught the notes with her brazen trumpet and
sounded them upon the house-top\tsk In a word,\break not an old woman
in the village or five miles round, who did not understand the
difficulties of my uncle Toby’s siege, and what were
the secret articles which had delay’d the
surrender.\tsh

My father, whose way was to force every event in nature into an
hypothesis,\catch{by} by which means never man crucified \ls{\textsc{Truth}}
at the rate he did\tsh had but just heard of the report as
my uncle Toby set out; and catching fire suddenly at
the trespass done his brother by it, was demonstrating to
Yorick, notwithstanding my mother was sitting
by\tsh not\break
\stick{only, \lqq That the devil was in women,}
\stick{\lqq and that the whole of the affair was}
\stick{\lqq lust;” but that every evil and disor-}
der in the world, of what kind or nature soever, from
the first fall of Adam, down to my uncle Toby’s
(inclusive), was owing one way or other to the same unruly
appetite.

Yorick was just bringing my father’s hypothesis to
some temper, when my uncle Toby entering the room with marks\catch{of}
of infinite benevolence and forgiveness in his looks, my
father’s eloquence re\-kindled against the
passion\tsh and as he was not very nice in the choice of
his words when he was wroth\tsh as soon as my uncle
Toby was seated by the fire, and had filled his pipe, my
father broke out in this manner.

provision should be
made for continuing the race
of so great, so exalted and godlike a
Being as man\tsk I am far from denying\tsk\break
but philosophy speaks freely of every thing; and therefore I still think and do
maintain it to be a pity, that it should be done by means of a
passion which bends down the faculties, and turns all the wisdom,
contemplations, and opera\-tions of the soul backwards\tsh a
passion, my dear, continued my father, addressing himself to my
mother, which couples and equals wise men with fools, and makes us
come out of our caverns and hiding-places more like satyrs and
four-footed beasts than men.\etp\patch{I know}

I know it will be said, continued my father (availing himself of
the \textit{Prolepsis})\break that in itself, and simply
taken\tsh like hunger, or thirst, or sleep\tsh ’tis an affair
neither good or bad\tsk or shameful or otherwise.\tsh Why then
did the delicacy of \textit{Diogenes} and \textit{Plato} so
recalcitrate against it? and wherefore, when we go about to make
and plant a man, do we put out the candle? and for what reason
is it, that all the parts thereof\tsk the congredients\tsk the
preparations\tsk the instruments, and whatever serves thereto,
are so held as to be conveyed to a cleanly mind by no language,
translation, or periphrasis whatever?

\tsh The act of killing and destroying a man, continued
my father, raising his voice\tsk and turning to my uncle
Toby\tsk\etp\catch{you} you see, is glorious\tsk and the weapons by
which we do it are honourable\tsh We march with them upon
our shoulders\tsk\break We strut with them by our
sides\tsh We gild them\tsh We carve
them\tsh We in-lay them\tsh We enrich
them\tsh\break Nay, if it be but a \textit{scoundril} cannon, we
cast an ornament upon the breech of it.\tsk

\tsh My uncle Toby laid down his pipe to
intercede for a better epithet\tsh\break and Yorick was
rising up to batter the whole hypothesis to
pieces\tsh

\tsh When Obadiah broke into the middle of the
room with a complaint, which cried out for an immediate
hear-\break ing.

The case was this:\patch{My}

My father, whether by ancient custom of the manor, or as
improprietor of the great tythes, was obliged to keep a\break Bull for
the service of the Parish, and Obadiah had led his cow upon
a \textit{pop-visit} to him one day or other the preceding
summer\tsh I say, one day or other\tsk because as chance
would have it,\break it was the day on which he was married to my
father’s house-maid\tsh so one was a reckoning to
the other. Therefore when Obadiah’s wife was brought
to\break
bed\tsk Obadiah thanked God\tsh

\tsh Now, said Obadiah, I shall have a calf: so
Obadiah went daily to visit his cow.\patch{She’ll}

She’ll calve on Monday\tsk on
Tuesday\break\tsk or Wednesday at the
farthest\tsh

The cow did not calve\tsh no\tsk she’ll not calve till next week\tsh the cow put it
off terribly\tsh till at the end of the sixth week Obadiah’s suspicions (like a
good man’s) fell upon the Bull.

Now the parish being very large, my father’s Bull, to
speak the truth of him, was no way equal to the department; he had,
however, got himself, somehow or other, thrust into
employment\tsk and as he went through the business with a grave
face, my father had a high opinion of him.\patch{\tsh Most}

\tsh Most of the townsmen, an’ please your
worship, quoth Obadiah, believe that ’tis all the
Bull’s fault\tsh

\tsh But may not a cow be barren?\break
replied my father, turning to Doctor\break Slop.

It never happens: said Dr.\@ Slop, but the man’s wife
may have come before her time naturally enough\tsh Prithee
has the child hair upon his head?\tsk\break added Dr.\@ Slop\tsh

\tsh It is as hairy as I am; said Obadiah.\tsh Obadiah had not been shaved for
three weeks\tsh Wheu - - u - - - -\break u - - - - - - - - cried my father; beginning the
sentence with an exclamatory\catch{whistle} whistle\tsh and so, brother Toby, this poor Bull of
mine, who is as good a Bull as ever p—ss’d, and might have done for
Europa herself in purer times\break\tsh had he but two legs less, might\break have
been driven into Doctors Commons and lost his character\tsh which to a\break Town Bull,
brother Toby, is the very\break same thing as his life\tsh

L-\kern 0.05em -\kern 0.05em d! said my mother, what is all\break this story about?\tsh

A {\addfontfeature{LetterSpace=40}COCK} and 
a {\addfontfeature{LetterSpace=40}BULL}, said\break
