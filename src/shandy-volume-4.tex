Now what might add, if any thing may be thought necessary to
add to so vehement a desire\tsk was this, that the centinel, the

\stick{and so manly withal\tsk as would have put} 
\stick{the heart in jeopardy (had his nose not}\catch{stood}
\stick{stood in his way) of every virgin who} 
had cast her eyes upon him.

I call not upon that heart which is a
\stick{stranger to the throbs and yearnings of} 
\stick{curiosity, so excited to justify the abbess}
\stick{of \textit{Quedlingberg}, the prioress, the deaness,}
\stck{and subchantress for sending at noon-day}

\stick{through the streets of \textit{Strasburg} with}

\stick{the best apparatus the straitness of the} 
\stick{time would allow her, for the illustration} 
\stick{of her theory\tsk she staid no longer than}
three days.

The centinel and the bandy-legg’d\break
\stick{drummer!\tsk nothing on this side of old} 
\stick{\textit{Athens} could equal them! they read}
\stick{their lectures under the city gates to}
\stick{comers and goers, with all the pomp}\catch{of} 
\stick{of a \textit{Chrysippus} and a \textit{Crantor} in their}
porticos.

The master of the inn, with his ostler 
\stick{on his left-hand, read his also in the same} 
\stck{stile,\tsk under the portico or gateway of his} 
\stck{stable-yard\tsk his wife, hers more privately}

\stick{\textit{burger} came crouding for intelligence\tsk} 
\stck{and every \textit{Strasburger} had the intelligence}

Tis worth remarking, for the benefit 
\stick{of all demonstrators in natural philoso-}
\stick{phy, \etc that as soon as the trumpeter’s} 
\stick{wife had finished the abbess of \textit{Quedlin}-}
\stick{\textit{berg}’s private lecture, and had begun to}
\stick{read in public, which she did upon a}\catch{stool}
\stick{stool in the middle of the great parade\tsh}
\stck{she incommoded the other demonstrators}
\stick{mainly, by gaining incontinently the}
\stick{most fashionable part of the city of \textit{Stras}-}
\stick{\textit{burg} for her auditory\tsk But when a de-}
\stick{monstrator in philosophy (cries \textit{Slawken}-}
\stick{\textit{bergius)}\sic has a \textit{trumpet} for an apparatus,} 
\stick{pray what rival in science can pretend to}
be heard besides him?

Whilst the unlearned, thro’ these con-
\stick{duits of intelligence, were all busied in}
\stick{getting down to the bottom of the well,}
\stick{where \textscl{Truth} keeps her little court\tsk}
\stick{were the learned in their way as busy in}
\stick{pumping her up thro’ the conduits of} 
\stick{dialect induction\tsk they concerned them-}
\tight{selves not with facts\tsk they reasoned\tsk}

Not one profession had thrown more 
\stick{light upon this subject than the faculty\tsk}\catch{had} 
\stick{had not all their disputes about it run into} 
\stick{the affair of \textit{Wens} and œdematous swel-}
\stick{lings, they could not keep clear of them} 
\stck{for their bloods and souls\tsh the stranger’s}
\stick{nose had nothing to do either with wens} 
or œdematous swellings.

It was demonstrated however very sa-
\stck{tisfactorily, that such a ponderous mass of}
heterogenous matter could not be congested and conglomerated to the
nose, whilst the infant was \textit{in Utero}, without destroying the
statical balance of the\break
fœtus, and throwing it plump upon its
head nine months before the time.\tsh

\tsk The opponents granted the theory\tsk\break they
denied the cousequences.\sic

And if a suitable provision of veins,\break
arteries, \etc said they, was not laid in,\catch{for} 
\stick{for the due nourishment of such a nose,} 
\stick{in the very first stamina and rudiments} 
\stick{of its formation  before it came into the} 
\stick{world (bating the case of Wens) it could} 
\stick{not regularly grow and be sustained af-}
terwards.

\tight{This was all answered by a dissertation}\break
\stick{upon nutriment, and the effect which} 
\stick{nutriment had in extending the vessels,}
\stick{and in the increase and prolongation of}
\stick{the muscular parts to the greatest growth}
\stick{and expansion imaginable\tsk In the tri-}
\stick{umph of which theory, they went so far} 
\stick{as to affirm, that there was no cause in}
\stick{nature, why a nose might not grow to} 
the size of the man himself.

The respondents satisfied the world\break
\stick{this event could never happen to them so}
\stick{long as a man had but one stomach and}\catch{one}
\stick{one pair of lungs\tsk For the stomach, said}
\stick{they, being the only organ destined for} 
\stick{the reception of food, and turning it into} 
\stick{chyle,\tsk and the lungs the only engine of}
\stck{sanguification\tsk it could possibly work off}
\stick{no more, than what the appetite brought} 
\stick{it: or admitting the possibility of a man’s} 
\stick{overloading his stomach, nature had set}
\stick{bounds however to his lungs\tsk the engine}
\stick{was of a determined size and strength,} 
\stck{and could elaborate but a certain quantity} 
\stick{in a given time\tsk that is, it could produce}
\stick{just as much blood as was sufficient for}
\stick{one single man, and no more; so that,} 
\stick{if there was as much nose as man\tsk they} 
\stick{proved a mortification must necessarily} 
\stick{ensue; and forasmuch as there could not}
\stick{be a support for both, that the nose must} 
\stick{either fall off from the man, or the man} 
inevitably fall off from his nose.\patch{Nature}

Nature accommodates herself to these\break 
\stick{emergencies, cried the  opponents\tsk else}
\stick{what do you say to the case of a whole}
\stick{stomach\tsk a whole pair of lungs, and but} 
\stick{\textit{half} a man, when both his legs have}
been unfortunately shot off?\tsk

He dies of a plethora, said they\tsk or\break
\stick{must spit blood, and in a fortnight or} 
three weeks go off in a consumption\tsk

\tsk It happens otherways\tsk replied the\break
opponents.\tsh

It ought not, said they.

The more curious and intimate inqui-\break
\stick{rers after nature and her doings, though} 
\stick{they went hand in hand a good way to-}
\stick{gether, yet they all divided about the} 
\stick{nose at last, almost as much as the fa-}
culty itself.\patch{They}

They amicably laid it down, that there\break
\stick{was a just and geometrical arrangement}
\stick{and proportion of the several parts of the}
\stick{human frame to its several destinations,} 
\stick{offices, and functions, which could not} 
\stick{be transgressed but within certain limits}
\stick{\tsk that nature, though she sported\tsk she}
\stick{sported within a certain circle;\tsk and they}
could not agree about the diameter of it.

The logicians stuck much closer to the\break
\stick{point before them than any of the classes} 
\stick{of the literati;\tsh they began and ended} 
\stick{with the word nose; and had it not been} 
\stick{for a \textit{petitio principii}, which one of the}
\stick{ablest of them ran his head against in the} 
\stick{beginning of the combat, the whole con-}
troversy had been settled at once.

A nose, argued the logician, cannot\break
\stick{bleed without blood\tsk and not only blood}\catch{\tsk but} 
\stick{\tsk but blood circulating in it to supply}
\stick{the phænomenon with a succession of} 
\stick{drops\tsk (a stream being but a quicker} 
\stick{succession of drops, that is included, said} 
\stick{he)\tsk Now death, continued the logician,} 
\stick{being nothing but the stagnation of the} 
blood\tsk

I deny the definition\tsh Death is the\break
\stick{separation of the soul from the body,} 
\stick{said his antagonist\tsk Then we don’t agree} 
\stick{about our weapon, said the logician\tsk} 
\stick{Then there is an end of the dispute, re-}
plied the antagonist.

The civilians were still more concise;\break
\stick{what they offered being more in the na-}
ture of a decree\tsk than a dispute.

\tsk Such a monstrous nose, said they,\break
\stck{had it been a true nose, could not possibly}
\stick{have been suffered in civil society\tsk and if}\catch{false}
\stick{false\tsk to impose upon society with such}
\stick{false signs and tokens, was a still greater}
\stick{violation of its rights, and must have}
had still less mercy shewn it.

The only objection to this was, that\break
\stick{if it proved any thing, it proved the}
\tight{stranger’s nose was neither true nor false.}

This left room for the controversy to\break
\stick{go on. It was maintained by the advo-}
\stick{cates of the ecclesiastic court, that there}
\stick{was nothing to inhibit a decree, since}
\stick{the stranger \textit{ex mero motu} had confessed}
\stick{he had been at the Promontory of Noses,} 
\stick{and had got one of the goodliest, \etc\etc}
\stick{\tsk To this it was answered, it was impossi-}
\stick{ble there should be such a place as the}
\stick{Promontory of Noses, and the learned be} 
\stick{ignorant where it lay. The commissary}
\stick{of the bishop of \textit{Strasburg} undertook the}\catch{advocates,}
\stick{advocates, explained this matter in a}
\stck{treatise upon proverbial phrases, shewing}
\stick{them, that the Promontory of Noses was}
\stck{a mere allegoric expression, importing no}
\stick{more than that nature had given him a} 
\stick{long nose: in proof of which, with great}

God’s power is infinite, cried the No\-sarians, he can do

He can do nothing, replied the Anti-nosarians, which implies
contradictions.

He can make matter think, said the Nosarians.

maintained the \textit{reality}\catch{of}
of the nose.\tsh It extends only to
all possible things, replied the \textit{Lutherans}.

By God in heaven, cried the Popish doctors, he can make a nose,
if he thinks fit, as big as the steeple of \textit{Strasburg}.

Now the steeple of \textit{Strasburg} being the biggest and the
tallest church-steeple to be seen in the whole world, the
Antino\-sarians denied that a nose of 575 geome\-trical feet in length
could be worn, at least by a middle-siz’d
man\tsk The Popish doctors swore it could\tsk The
\textit{Lutheran} doctors said No;\tsk it could not.

This at once started a new dispute, which they pursued a great
way upon the extent and limitation of the moral and natural
attributes of God\tsk That controversy led them naturally into
\textit{Thomas}\catch{\textit{Aquinas},} \textit{Aquinas}, and \textit{Thomas

sailed before the wind.

\stck{hand\tsk the rest following higglety-pigglety}

\stick{some down the \textit{Rhine}\tsk some this way\tsk}
\stick{some that\tsk all set out at sun-rise to meet} 
the courteous stranger on the road.

\tight{Haste we now towards the catastrophe}\break
\stick{of my tale\tsk I say \textit{Catastrophe} (cries \textit{Slaw}-}
\stick{\textit{kenbergius}) inasmuch as a tale, with parts}
\stick{rightly disposed, not only rejoiceth (\textit{gau}-}
\stick{\textit{det}) in the \textit{Catastrophe} and \textit{Peripeitia} of}
\stick{a \textscl{Drama}, but rejoiceth moreover in all}
\stick{the essential and integrant parts of it\tsk}
\stick{it has its \textit{Protasis}, \textit{Epitasis}, \textit{Catastasis},}
\stick{\lower.2ex\hbox{i}ts\sic \textit{Catastrophe} or \textit{Peripeitia} growing one}
\stick{out of the other in it, in the order \textit{Aristotle}} 
\stick{first planted them\tsh without which a tale}\catch{had} 
\stick{had better never be told at all, says}
\stick{\textit{Slawkenbergius}, but be kept to a man’s}
self.

In all my ten tales, in all my ten de\-cads, have I,
\textit{Slawkenbergius}, tied down every tale of them as
tightly to this rule, as I have done this of the stranger and\break
his nose.

\tsk From his first parley with the centi\-nel, to his
leaving the city of \textit{Strasburg}, after pulling off his
crimson-sattin pair of breeches, is the \textit{Protasis} or first
entrance\break
\tsk where the characters of the \textit{Personæ
Dramatis} are just touched in, and the\break
subject slightly begun.

The \textit{Epitasis}, wherein the action is\break
more fully entered upon and heightened,\break
till it arrives at its state or height called\catch{the}
\stick{the \textit{Catastasis}, and which usually takes} 
\stick{up the 2d and 3d act, is included within} 
\stick{that busy period of my tale, betwixt the}
\stick{first night’s uproar about the nose, to}
\stick{the conclusion of the trumpeter’s wife’s} 
\stick{lectures upon it in the middle of the} 
\stick{grand parade; and from the first em-}
\stick{barking of the learned in the dispute\tsk} 
\stick{to the doctors finally sailing away, and} 
\stick{leaving the \textit{Strasburgers} upon the beach} 
\stick{in distress, is the \textit{Catastasis} or the ripen-}
\stick{ing of the incidents and passions for their} 
bursting forth in the fifth act.

This commences with the setting out\break
\stick{of the \textit{Strasburgers} in the \textit{Frankfort} road,} 
\stick{and terminates in unwinding the laby-}
\stick{rinth and bringing the hero out of a} 
\stick{state of agitation (as \textit{Aristotle} calls it)} 
to a state of rest and quietness.\patch{This,}

This, says \textit{Hafen Slawkenbergius}, con-\break
\stick{stitutes the catastrophe or peripeitia of} 
\stick{my tale\tsk and that is the part of it I am} 
going to relate.

We left the stranger behind the curtain\break
asleep\tsk he enters now upon the stage.

\tsk What dost thou prick up thy ears\break
\stick{at?\tsk ’tis nothing but a man upon a horse}
\stick{\tsk was the last word the stranger uttered}
\stick{to his mule. It was not proper then to}
\stick{tell the reader, that the mule took his}
\stick{master’s word for it; and without any}
\stick{more \textit{ifs} or \textit{ands}, let the traveller and his}
horse pass by.

The traveller was hastening with all\break
\stick{diligence to get to \textit{Strasburg} that night}
\stick{\tsk What a fool am I, said the traveller} 
\stick{to himself, when he had rode about a}\catch{league}
\stick{league farther, to think of getting into} 
\stick{\textit{Strasburg} this night.\tsk \textit{Strasburg!}\tsk the} 
\stick{great \textit{Strasburg!}\tsk \textit{Strasburg}, the capital} 
\stick{of all \textit{Alsatia!} \textit{Strasburg}, an imperial} 
\stick{city! \textit{Strasburg}, a sovereign state! \textit{Stras}-}
\stick{\textit{burg}, garrisoned with five thousand of} 
\stick{the best troops in all the world!\tsk Alas!}
\stick{if I was at the gates of \textit{Strasburg} this}
\stick{moment, I could not gain admittance into}
\stick{it for a ducat,\tsk nay a ducat and half\tsk}
\stick{’tis too much\tsk better go back to the last}
\stick{inn I have passed\tsk than lie I know not}
\stick{where\tsk or give I know not what. The} 
\stick{traveller, as he made these reflections in} 
\stick{his mind, turned his horse’s head about,} 
\stick{and three minutes after the stranger had} 
\stick{been conducted into his chamber, he ar-}
rived at the same inn.

\tsk We have bacon in the house, said the host, and
bread\tsh and till eleven o’clock this night had
three eggs in it\tsk\catch{but}
but a stranger, who arrived an hour
ago, has had them dressed into an omelet, and we have
nothing.\tsh

\tsk Alas! said the traveller, harassed \break
\stick{as I am, I want nothing but a bed\tsk I} 
\stick{have one as soft as is in \textit{Alsatia}, said the}
host.

\tsk The stranger, continued he, should\break
\stick{have slept in it, for ’tis my best bed, but} 
\stick{upon the score of his nose\tsk He has got} 
\stick{a defluxion, said the traveller\tsk Not that} 
\stick{I know, cried the host\tsk But ’tis a camp-}
\stick{bed, and \textit{Jacinta}, said he, looking to-}
\stick{wards the maid, imagined there was not} 
\stick{room in it to turn his nose in\tsk Why so?}
\stick{cried the traveller, starting back.\tsk It is so} 
\stick{long a nose, replied the host\tsk The tra-}
\stick{veller fixed his eyes upon \textit{Jacinta}, then} 
\stick{upon the ground\tsk kneeled upon his right}\catch{knee}
\stick{knee\tsk had just got his hand laid upon}
\stick{his breast\tsk Trifle not with my anxiety,}
\stick{said he, rising up again\tsk ’Tis no trifle,}
\stick{said \textit{Jacinta}, ’tis the most glorious nose!}
\stick{\tsk The traveller fell upon his knee again\tsk}
\stck{laid his hand upon his breast\tsk then said he,} 
\stick{looking up to heaven! thou hast con-}
\stick{ducted me to the end of my pilgrimage}
\tsh ’Tis \textit{Diego!}

The traveller was the brother of the \break
\stick{Julia, so often invoked that night by the}
\stick{stranger as he rode from \textit{Strasburg} upon} 
\stick{his mule; and was come, on her part,}
\stick{in quest of him. He had accompanied}
\stick{his sister from \textit{Valadolid} across the \textit{Pyre}-}
\stick{\textit{nean} mountains thro’ \textit{France}, and had}
\stick{many an entangled skein to wind off in}
\stick{pursuit of him thro’ the many meanders}
\stick{and abrupt turnings of a lover’s thorny}
tracks.\patch{\tsk Julia}

\tsk Julia had sunk under it\tsk and had\break
\stick{not been able to go a step farther than to} 
\stck{\textit{Lyons}, where, with the many disquietudes} 
\stick{of a tender heart, which all talk of\tsk but} 
\stick{few feel\tsk she sicken’d, but had just}
\stick{strength to write a letter to \textit{Diego}; and}
\stick{having conjured her brother never to see} 
\stick{her face till he had found him out, and} 
\stick{put the letter into his hands, Julia took}
to her bed.

\textit{Fernandez} (for that was her brother’s\break
\stick{name)\tsh tho’ the camp-bed was as soft as} 
\stick{any one in \textit{Alsace}, yet he could not shut}
\stick{his eyes in it.\tsk As soon as it was day he} 
\stick{rose, and hearing \textit{Diego} was risen too,}
\stick{he enter’d his chamber, and discharged} 
his sister’s commission.

The letter was as follows:\patch{Seig.}

\indent\quad Seig. \textsc{Diego},\\
\indent\lqq Whether my suspicions of your nose\break
\lqq were justly excited or not\tsk ’tis not now\break
\lqq to inquire\tsk it is enough I have not\break
\lqq had firmness to put them to farther\break
\lqq tryal.\break
\break
\indent\lqq How could I know so little of my-\break
\lqq self, when I sent my \textit{Duenna} to forbid\break
\lqq your coming more under my lattice?\break
\lqq or how could I know so little of you,\break
\lqq \textit{Diego}, as to imagine you would not\break
\lqq have staid one day in \textit{Valadolid} to have\break
\lqq given ease to my doubts?\tsk Was I to\break
\lqq be abandoned, \textit{Diego}, because I was\break
\lqq deceived? or was it kind to take me\break
\lqq at my word, whether my suspicions\break
\lqq were just or no, and leave me, as you\break
\lqq did, a prey to much uncertainty and\break
\lqq sorrow.\patch{\lqq In}

\indent\lqq In what manner Julia has resented\break
\lqq this\tsk my brother, when he puts this\break
\lqq letter into your hands, will tell you:\break
\lqq He will tell you in how few moments\break
\lqq she repented of the rash message she\break
\lqq had sent you\tsk in what frantic haste\break
\lqq she flew to her lattice, and how many\break
\lqq days and nights together she leaned\break
\lqq immoveably upon her elbow, looking\break
\lqq thro’ it towards the way which \textit{Diego}\break
\lqq was wont to come.\hfill

\indent\lqq He will tell you, when she heard\break
\lqq of your departure\tsk how her spirits de-\break
\lqq serted her\tsk how her heart sicken’d\tsk\break
\lqq how piteously she mourn’d\tsh how low\break
\lqq she hung her head. O \textit{Diego!} how\break
\lqq many weary steps has my brother’s\break
\lqq pity led me by the hand languishing\break
\lqq to trace out yours! how far has desire\break
\lqq carried me beyond strength\tsh and how\catch{\lqq oft}
\lqq oft have I fainted by the way, and\break
\lqq sunk into his arms, with only power\break
\lqq to cry out\tsk O my \textit{Diego!}

\indent\lqq If the gentleness of your carriage\break
\lqq has not belied your heart, you will fly\break
\lqq to me, almost as fast as you fled from\break
\lqq me\tsk haste as you will, you will arrive\break
\lqq but to see me expire.\tsk ’Tis a bitter\break
\lqq draught, \textit{Diego}, but oh!\@ ’tis embitter’d\break
\lqq still more by dying \textit{un}\tsh.”

She could proceed no farther.

\textit{Slawkenbergius} supposes the word in-\break
\stick{tended was \textit{unconvinced}, but her strength}
would not enable her to finish her letter.

The heart of the courteous \textit{Diego}\break
\stick{overflowed as he read the letter\tsk he or-}
\stick{dered his mule forthwith and \textit{Fernandez}’s}\catch{horse} 
\stick{horse to be saddled; and as no vent in}
\stick{prose is equal to that of poetry in such}
\stick{conflicts\tsk chance, which as often directs}
\stick{us to remedies as to \textit{diseases}, having} 
\stick{thrown a piece of charcoal into the wind-}
\stick{ow\tsk \textit{Diego} availed himself of it, and} 
\stick{whilst the ostler was getting ready his} 
\stick{mule, he eased his mind against the wall} 
as follows.

The lines were very natural\tsk for they \break
\stick{were nothing at all to the purpose, says}

\stick{that \textit{Diego}’s mule and \textit{Fernandez}’s horse}
\stick{were ready at the door of the inn, before} 
\stick{\textit{Diego} was ready for his second stanza;} 
\stick{so without staying to finish his ode, they}
\stick{both mounted, sallied forth, passed the}

\stick{course towards \textit{Lyons}, and before the}
\stck{\textit{Strasburgers} and the abbess of \textit{Quedlinberg}} 
\stick{had set out on their cavalcade, had \textit{Fer}-}
\stick{\textit{nandez}, \textit{Diego}, and his \textit{Julia}, crossed} 
\stick{the \textit{Pyrenean} mountains, and got safe to}
\textit{Valadolid.}\patch{’Tis}

’Tis needless to inform the geographi-\break
\stick{cal reader, that when \textit{Diego} was in \textit{Spain},}
\stick{it was not possible to meet the courteous} 
\stick{stranger in the \textit{Frankfort} road; it is} 
\stick{enough to say, that of all restless desires,} 
\stick{curiosity being the strongest\tsk the \textit{Stras}-}
\stick{\textit{burgers} felt the full force of it; and that} 
\stck{for three days and nights they were tossed} 
\stick{to and fro in the \textit{Frankfort} road, with} 
\stick{the tempestuous fury of this passion, be-}
\stick{fore they could submit to return home\tsk} 
\stick{When alas! an event was prepared for} 
\stick{them, of all others the most grievous} 
that could befal a free people.

As this revolution of the \textit{Strasburgers}\break
\stick{affairs is often spoken of, and little un-}
\stick{derstood, I will, in ten words, says \textit{Slawk}-}
\stick{\textit{enbergius}, give the world an explanation} 
\stick{of it, and with it put an end to my} 
tale.\patch{Every}

Every body knows of the grand sy-\break
\stick{stem of Universal Monarchy, wrote by}
\stick{order of Mons.\@ \textit{Colbert}, and put in ma-}
\stick{nuscript into the hands of \textit{Lewis} the} 
fourteenth, in the year 1664.

’Tis as well known, that one branch\break
\stick{out of many of that system, was the}
\stick{getting possession of \textit{Strasburg}, to favour}
\stick{an entrance at all times into \textit{Suabia}, in}
\stick{order to disturb the quiet of \textit{Germany}\tsk}
\stick{and that in consequence of this plan,}
\stick{\textit{Strasburg} unhappily fell at length into} 
their hands.

It is the lot of few to trace out the\break
\stick{true springs of this and such like revolu-}
\stick{tions\tsk The vulgar look too high for}
\stick{them\tsk Statesmen look too low\tsk Truth}
(for once) lies in the middle.\patch{What}

What a fatal thing is the popular pride\break
\stick{of a free city!\@ cries one historian\tsk The} 
\stick{\textit{Strasburgers} deemed it a diminution of} 
\stick{their freedom to receive an imperial gar-}
\tight{rison\tsk and so fell a prey to a \textit{French} one}.

The fate, says another, of the \textit{Stras}-\break
\stick{\textit{burgers}, may be a warning to all free}
\stick{people to save their money\tsk They anti-}
\stick{cipated their revenues\tsk brought them-}
\stick{selves under taxes, exhausted their}
\stick{strength, and in the end became so weak}
\stick{a people, they had not strength to keep} 
\stick{their gates shut, and so the \textit{French} pushed}
them open.

Alas!\@ alas!\@ cries \textit{Slawkenbergius}, ’twas\break
\stick{not the \textit{French}\tsk ’twas \textscl{curiosity} pushed} 
\stick{them open\tsk The \textit{French} indeed, who are}
\stick{ever upon the catch, when they saw the} 
\stick{\textit{Strasburgers}, men, women, and children,}\catch{all} 
\stick{all marched out to follow the stranger’s}
\stick{nose\tsk each man followed his own, and} 
marched in.

Trade and manufactures have decayed\break 
\stick{and gradually grown down ever since\tsk} 
\stick{but not from any cause which commer-}
\stick{cial heads have assigned; for it is owing} 
\stick{to this only, that Noses have ever so run} 
\stick{in their heads, that the \textit{Strasburgers} could} 
not follow their business.

Alas! alas! cries \textit{Slawkenbergius}, ma-\break

\dropcap{W}{ith} all this learning upon Noses

many family prejudices\tsk and ten decads of such tales
running on for ever along with them\tsk how was it possible

To tell that before-hand, madam,\break would be to do injury to one of
the best tales in the christian world; and that is the tenth of the
tenth decad, which immediately follows this.

This tale, cried \textit{Slawkenbergius}, some-\break

\stick{had pushed him down, for a full hour} 
\stick{and a half, before he began to play upon} 
\stick{the floor with the toe of that foot which}
\stick{hung over the bed-side; my uncle \textit{Toby}’s}
\stick{heart was a pound lighter for it.\tsk In a}
\stick{few moments, his left-hand, the knuckles}
\stick{of which had all the time reclined upon}

\stick{having no talents, as I said, that way,} 
\stick{and fearing moreover that he might set}
\stick{out with something which might make a} 
\stick{bad matter worse, he contented himself} 
\stick{with resting his chin placidly upon the} 
cross of his crutch.

\tighter{Now whether the compression shortened}\break
\stick{my uncle \textit{Toby}’s face into a more plea-}
\stick{sureable oval\tsk or that the philanthropy} 
\stick{of his heart, in seeing his brother begin-}

\stick{\textit{Toby} had shot him; but it was not added} 
\stick{that every other limb and member of my}

\stick{the same precise attitude in which he lay}

\stick{\textit{Trim} left the room, and my father found} 
\stick{himself disposed to rise off the bed,\tsk he}
\stick{had all the little preparatory movements}
\stick{to run over again, before he could do it.}
\stick{\tsk  Attitudes are nothing, madam,\tsk ’tis the}

\stick{his left, and stooping a little, he addressed}
himself to my uncle \textit{Toby} as follows.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace VII.}

\dropcap{W}{hen} I reflect, brother \textit{Toby},\break

\stick{that dark side of him which represents}

\stick{Zooks! said my father, did not my uncle}
\stick{leave you a hundred and twenty pounds} 
\stick{a year?\tsk What could I have done with-}
\stick{out it? replied my uncle \textit{Toby}.\tsk That’s} 
\stick{another concern, said my father testily\tsk}
\stick{But I say, \textit{Toby}, when one runs over the} 
\stick{catalogue of all the cross reckonings and} 
\stick{sorrowful \textit{items} with which the heart of} 
\stick{man is overcharged, ’tis wonderful by} 
\stick{\tight{what hidden resources the mind is enabled}}
\stick{to stand it out, and bear itself up, as it}
\stick{does against the impositions laid upon} 
\stick{our nature.\tsh ’Tis by the assistance of}
\stick{Almighty God, cried my uncle \textit{Toby},}
\stick{looking up, and pressing the palms of} 
\stick{his hands close together\tsk ’tis not from}
\stick{our own strength, brother \textit{Shandy}\tsk a sen-}
\stick{tinel in a wooden centry-box, might as}
\stick{well pretend to stand it out against a}

\stick{by the grace and the assistance of the best} 
of Beings.

\tsk That is cutting the knot, said my\break
\stick{father, instead of untying it.\tsk But give}
\stick{me leave to lead you, brother \textit{Toby}, a} 
little deeper into the mystery.

With all my heart, replied my uncle\break\textit{Toby}.

My father instantly exchanged the at-\break
\stick{titude he was in, for that in which \textit{So}-}
\stick{\textit{crates} is so finely painted by \textit{Raffael} in}
\stick{his school of \textit{Athens}; which your con-}
\stick{noisseurship knows is so exquisitely ima-}
\stick{gined, that even the particular manner} 
\stick{of the reasoning of \textit{Socrates} is expressed} 
\stick{by it\tsk for he holds the fore-finger of his}

\stick{\lqq and this, and this, I don’t ask of}
\stick{\lqq you\tsk they follow of themselves in}

So stood my father, holding fast his\break
\stick{fore-finger betwixt his finger and his}
\stick{thumb, and reasoning with my uncle}
\stick{\textit{Toby} as he sat in his old fringed chair,}
\stick{valanced around with party-coloured}

My father made all possible speed to find his breeches.

\textit{Susannah} got the start, and kept it\tsk ’Tis
\textit{Tris}\tsk something, cried \textit{Susannah}\tsk\catch{There}

night-gown across his arm, with nothing\break
more than his breeches on, fastened\break
through haste with but a single button,\break
and that button through haste thrust\break
only half into the button-hole.

\initial{I}{Wish} I could write a chapter upon\break
sleep.

A fitter occasion could never have presented itself, than what
this moment offers, when all the curtains of the family are
drawn\tsk the candles put out\tsk and no creature’s eyes
are open but a single one, for the other has been shut these twenty
years, of my mother’s nurse.

It is a fine subject!\patch{And}

And yet, as fine as it is, I would undertake to write a dozen chapters upon
button-holes, both quicker and with\break
more fame than a single chapter upon this.

Button-holes!\tsh there is something\break
lively in the very idea of ’em\tsk and trust\break
me, when I get amongst ’em\tsk You\break
gentry with great beards\tsh look as\break
grave as you will\tsh I’ll make merry\break
work with my button-holes\tsk I shall have
’em all to myself\tsk ’tis a maiden subject\break\tsk I shall run
foul of no man’s wisdom or fine sayings in it.

But for sleep\tsk I know I shall make nothing of it before I begin\tsk I am no dab at
your fine sayings in the first place\break\tsk and in the
next, I cannot for my soul\catch{set}
set a grave face upon a bad matter, and tell the world\tsk
’tis the refuge of the unfortunate\tsk the enfranchisement
of the prisoner\tsk the downy lap of the hopeless, the
weary and the broken-hearted; nor could I set out with a
lye in my mouth, by affirming, that of all the soft and
delicious functions of our nature, by which the great Author
of it, in his bounty, has been pleased to recompence the
sufferings wherewith his justice and his good pleasure has
wearied us,\tsh that this is the chiefest (I know pleasures
worth ten of it) or what a happiness it is to man, when the
anxieties and passions of the day are over, and he lays down
upon his back, that his soul shall be so seated within him,
that which ever way she turns her eyes, the heavens shall
look calm and sweet above her\tsk no desire\tsk or fear\tsk
or doubt that troubles the air,\catch{nor}
\stick{nor any difficulty pass’d,
present, or to} come, that the imagination may not\break
pass over without offence, in that sweet\break secession.

\tsk\lqq God’s blessing, said \textit{Sancho Panca},\break
\lqq be upon the man who first invented\break
\lqq this self-same thing called sleep\tsk it\break
\lqq covers a man all over like a cloak.\,”\break
Now there is more to me in this, and it speaks warmer to my
heart and affections, than all the dissertations squeez’d out
of the heads of the learned together upon the subject.

\tsk Not that I altogether disapprove of what \textit{Montaigne} advances upon
it\tsk ’tis admirable in its way.\tsk (I quote by
memory.)\patch{The}

I cause myself to be disturbed in my sleep, that I may the better and
more sensibly relish it\tsk And yet I see few, says he
again, who live with less sleep\break

The different weight, dear Sir\tsh nay even the
different package of two vexations of the same
weight,\tsh makes a very wide difference in our manner of
bearing and getting through with them.\tsk It is\catch{not} not half
an hour ago, when (in the great hurry and precipitation of a poor
devil’s writing for daily bread) I threw a fair sheet, which
I had just finished, and carefully wrote out, slap into the fire,
instead of the foul one.

Instantly I snatch’d off my wig, and threw it
perpendicularly, with all imaginable violence, up to the top of the
room\break\tsk indeed I caught it as it fell\tsk but there was
an end of the matter; nor do I think any think else in
\textit{Nature}, would have given such immediate ease: She, dear
Goddess, by an instantaneous impulse, in all \textit{provoking
cases}, determines us to a sally of this or that member\tsk or
else she thrusts us into this or that place, or posture of body, we
know not why\tsk But mark, madam, we live amongst riddles

nature’s works; so that this, like a thousand other things,
falls out for us in a way, which tho’ we cannot reason upon
it,\tsk yet we find the good of it, may it please your reverences
and your worships\tsh and that’s enough for us.

Now, my father could not lie down with this affliction for his
life\tsk nor could he carry it up stairs like the other\tsk
He walked composedly out with it to the fish-pond.

Had my father leaned his head upon his hand, and reasoned an
hour which\catch{way} way to have gone\tsk reason, with all her
force, could not have directed him to any think like it: there is
something, Sir, in fish-ponds\tsk but what it is, I leave\break

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XXV.}

\dropcap{\Usk{16pt}N}{o} doubt, Sir\tsk there is
a whole\break
chapter wanting here\tsk and a\break 
chasm of ten pages made in the book
by it\tsk but the book-binder is neither a\break 
fool, or a knave, or a puppy\tsk nor is the\break
book a jot more imperfect, (at least upon\break 
that score)\tsk but, on the contrary, the\break
book is more perfect and complete by\break
wanting the chapter, than having it, as\break
I shall demonstrate to your reverences in this
manner\tsk I question first by the bye, whether the same
experiment might not be made as successfully upon sundry other
chapters\tsh but there is no end, an’ please your
reverences, in trying experiments upon chapters\tsh we
have had\catch{enough} enough of it\tsh So there’s an end of that
matter.

But before I begin my demonstration, let me only tell you,
that the chapter which I have torn out, and which otherwise
you would all have been reading\break just now, instead of
this,\tsk was the description of my father’s, my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s, \textit{Trim}’s, and \textit{Obadiah}’s
setting out and\break journeying to the visitation at
\raise3pt\hbox{\astiv}.

We’ll go in the coach, said my father\break
\tsk Prithee, have the arms been altered,
\textit{Obadiah}?\tsk It would have made my story much
better to have begun with telling you, that at the time my
mother’s arms were added to the \textit{Shandy}’s, when the
coach was repainted upon my father’s marriage, it had so
fallen out, that the coach painter, whether by performing\catch{all} all
his works with the left hand, like\break
\textit{Turpilius} the
\textit{Roman}, or \textit{Hans Holbein} of
\textit{Basil}\tsk or whether ’twas more from the blunder of
his head than hand\tsk or whe\-ther, lastly, it was from the
sinister turn which every thing relating to our family was
apt to take\tsk It so fell out, however, to our reproach,
that instead of the \textit{bend dexter}, which since
\textit{Harry} the Eighth’s reign was honestly our due\tsk a
\textit{bend sinister}, by some of these fatalities, had
been drawn quite across the field of the \textit{Shandy}-arms. 
’Tis scarce credible that the mind of so wise a man as
my father was, could be so much incommoded with so small a
matter. The word coach\tsk let it be whose it would\tsk or
coach-man, or coach-horse, or coach-hire, could never be
named in the family, but he constantly complained of
carrying this vile mark of illegitimacy upon the door of his
own;\catch{he} he never once was able to step into the coach, or out
of it, without turning\break round to take a view of the arms, and
making a vow at the same time, that it was the last time he
would ever set his foot in it again, till the
\textit{bend-sinister} was taken out\tsk but like the affair
of the hinge, it was one of the many things which the
\textit{Destinies} had set down in their books\tsk ever to be
grumbled at (and in wiser families than ours)\tsk but never
to\break be mended.

\tsk Has the \textit{bend-sinister} been brush’d out, I
say? said my father\tsk There has been nothing brush’d out, Sir, answered
\textit{Obadiah}, but the lining. We’ll go\break o’horse-back,
said my father, turning to \textit{Yorick}\tsk Of all things in the
world, except politicks, the clergy know the least of heraldry,
said \textit{Yorick.}\tsk No matter for\catch{that,} that, cried my
father\tsk I should be sorry to appear with a blot in my
escutcheon before them\tsh Never mind the
\textit{bend-sinister}, said my uncle \textit{Toby}, putting
on his tye-wig\tsh No, indeed, said my father,\break \tsk you
may go with my aunt \textit{Dinah} to a visitation with a
\textit{bend-sinister}, if you think fit\tsk My poor uncle
\textit{Toby} blush’d. My father was vexed at himself.\tsk
No\tsk my dear brother \textit{Toby}, said my father,
changing his tone\tsk but the damp of the coach-lining about
my loins, may give \stick{me the Sciatica again, as it did
\textit{December},} \textit{January}, and \textit{February} last
winter\tsk so if you please you shall ride my wife’s
pad\break\tsk
and as you are to preach, \textit{Yorick}, you had better
make the best of your way before,\tsk and leave me to take
care of my brother \textit{Toby}, and to follow at our\break
own rates.\patch{Now}

Now the chapter I was obliged to tear\break
out, was the description of this cavalcade,\break
in which corporal \textit{Trim} and \textit{Obadiah},\break
upon two coach-horses a-breast, led the\break
way as slow as a patrole\tsk whilst my\break
uncle \textit{Toby}, in his laced regimentals and\break
tye-wig, kept his rank with my father,\break
\stck{in deep roads and dissertations alternately}\break
upon the advantage of learning and arms,\break
as each could get the start.


\tsk But the painting of this journey, upon reviewing it,
appears to be so much above the stile and manner of any thing else
I have been able to paint in this\break book, that it could not have
remained in it, without depreciating every other scene; and
destroying at the same time that necessary equipoise and
balance,\break
(whether of good or bad) betwixt chapter and chapter, from whence
the just\catch{proportions} proportions and harmony of the whole work results. For my
own part, I am but just set up in the business, so know little
about it\tsk but, in my opinion, to write a book is for all the
world like humming a song\tsk be but in tune with yourself,
madam, ’tis no matter how high or how low you take it.\tsk


\tsk This is the reason, may it please your reverences, that
some of the lowest and flattest compositions pass off
very\break
well\tsk (as \textit{Yorick} told my uncle \textit{Toby} one
night) by siege\tsk My uncle \textit{Toby} looked brisk at
the sound of the word \textit{siege}, but could make neither head or tail of
it.

I’m to preach at court next Sunday, \stick{said
\textit{Homenas}\tsk run over my notes\tsk so I}
humm’d over doctor \textit{Homenas}’s notes\tsk the
modulation’s very well\tsk ’twill do,\catch{\textit{Homenas},}
\textit{Homenas}, if it holds on at this rate\tsk so on I
humm’d\tsk and a tolerable tune I thought it was; and to
this hour, may it please your reverences, had never found
out how low, how flat, how spiritless and jejune it was, but
that all of a sudden, up started an air in the middle of it,
so fine, so rich, so heavenly\tsk it carried my soul up
with it into the other world; now had I, (as
\textit{Montaigne} complained in a parallel accident)\tsk
had I found the declivity easy, or the ascent accessible\tsk
certes I had been outwitted\break
\tsk Your notes, \textit{Homenas}, I should have said, are
good notes,\tsk but it was so per\-pendicular a precipice\tsk
so wholly cut off from the rest of the work, that by
the\break
first note I humm’d, I found myself\break flying into the other
world, and from thence discovered the vale from whence\break
I came, so deep, so low, and dismal,\catch{that}
that I shall never have
the heart to descend into it again.

\noindent
\fist A dwarf who brings a standard\break
along with him to measure his own size\break
\tsk take my word, is a dwarf in more articles than
one\tsk And so much for tearing out of chapters.

if he is not cutting it all into slips, and giving them
about him to light their pipes!\tsh ’Tis abominable,
answered \textit{Didius;} it should not go unnoticed, said
doctor \textit{Kysarcius}\tsh \fist  he was of the
\textit{Kysarcij} of the low countries.

Methinks, said \textit{Didius}, half rising\break
from his chair, in order to remove a\catch{bottle}
bottle and a tall decanter, which stood in a direct line
betwixt him and \textit{Yorick}\break
\stck{\tsk you might have spared this sarcastick}
stroke, and have hit upon a more proper
place, Mr.\@ \textit{Yorick}\tsk or at least upon a more

to be preached before so learned a body; and if ’twas good

\tsk I have got him fast hung up, quoth \textit{Didius}
to himself, upon one of the two horns of my
dilemma\tsh let him get off as he can.\patch{I have}

I have undergone such unspeakable torments, in bringing
forth this sermon, quoth \textit{Yorick}, upon this
occasion,\tsk that I declare, \textit{Didius}, I would suffer
martyrdom\tsk and if it was possible my horse with me, a
thousand times over, before I would sit down and make such
another: I was delivered of it at the wrong end of me\tsk it
came from my head instead of my heart\tsk and it is for the
pain it gave me, both in the writing and preaching of it,
that I revenge myself of it, in this manner.\tsk To preach,
to shew the extent of our reading, or the subtleties of our
wit\tsk to parade in the eyes of the vulgar with the
beggarly accounts of a little learning, tinseled over with a

preaching\catch{the}
the gospel\tsk but ourselves\tsk For my own part, continued
\textit{Yorick}, I had rather\break direct five words point blank

As \textit{Yorick} pronounced the word \textit{point blank},
my uncle \textit{Toby} rose up to say\break something upon
projectiles\tsh when a\break single word, and no more, uttered

\dropcap{Z}{ounds!}\tsh\tsh\break
\tsh\tsh\tsh\tsh\tsk\break
\tsh\tsh\tsk Z\tsh ds!  cried \textit{Phu-\break tatorius},
partly to himself\tsk and yet high enough to be heard\tsk
and what seemed odd, ’twas uttered in a construction of
look, and in a tone of voice, somewhat between that of a man
in amazement,\break
and of one in bodily pain.

One or two who had very nice ears, and could distinguish the
expression and mixture of the two tones as plainly as a
\textit{third} or a \textit{fifth}, or any other chord in musick\tsk were the most puzzled and perplexed
with it\tsk the \textit{concord} was good in itself\tsk but then
’twas quite out of the\catch{key,}
\stick{key, and no way applicable to the subject}
\stck{started;\tsk so that with all their knowledge,}
they could not tell what in the world to make of it.

Others who knew nothing of musical\break 
\stick{expression, and merely lent their ears to}
the plain import of the \textit{word}, imagined that
\textit{Phutatorius}, who was somewhat of a cholerick spirit, was
just going to snatch \stick{the cudgels out of \textit{Didius}’s
hands, in order} to bemawl \textit{Yorick} to some purpose\tsk and
that the desperate monosyllable Z\tsh ds was the exordium
to an oration, which, as they judged from the sample, presaged but
a rough kind of handling of him;\break 
so that my uncle \textit{Toby}’s good nature felt\break
a pang for what \textit{Yorick} was about to\break undergo. But seeing
\textit{Phutatorius} stop\break short,
without any attempt or desire to go on\tsk a third party began to
suppose,\catch{that}
that it was no more than an involuntary respiration,
casually forming itself into the shape of a twelve-penny
oath\tsk without the sin or substance of one.

Others, and especially one or two who
sat next him, looked upon it on the contrary, 
as a real and substantial oath pro\-pensly 
formed against \textit{Yorick}, to whom
he was known to bear no good liking\tsk\break 
which said oath, as my father philosophized
upon it, actually lay fretting and 
fuming at that very time in the upper 
regions of \textit{Phutatorius}’s purtenance; and
so was naturally, and according to the
due course of things, first squeezed out
by the sudden influx of blood, which
was driven into the right ventricle of 
\textit{Phutatorius}’s heart, by the stroke of surprize 
which so strange a theory of 
preaching had excited.\patch{How}

How finely we argue upon mistaken facts!

There was not a soul busied in all these various reasonings upon
the monosyllable which \textit{Phutatorius} uttered,\tsk who did not
take this for granted, proceeding upon it as from an axiom, namely,
that \textit{Phutatorius}’s mind was intent upon the subject of debate which was arising between
\textit{Didius} and \textit{Yorick}; and indeed as he looked first
towards the one, and then towards the other, with the air of a man
listening to what was going forwards,\tsk who would not have
thought the same? But the truth was, that \textit{Phutatorius} knew
not one word or one syllable of what was passing\tsk but his
whole thoughts and attention were taken up with a transaction which
was going forwards at that very instant within the precincts of his
own\catch{\textit{Galli}-} \textit{Galligaskins}, and in a part of them, where of all others
he stood most interested to watch accidents: So that
notwithstanding he looked with all the attention in the world, and
had gradually skrewed up every nerve and muscle in his face, to the
utmost pitch the instrument would bear, in order, as it was
thought, to give a sharp reply to \textit{Yorick}, who sat
over-against him\tsk Yet I say, was \textit{Yorick} never
once in any one domicile of \textit{Phutatorius}’s
brain\tsk but the true cause of his exclamation lay at
least a yard below.

This I will endeavour to explain to you with all imaginable
decency.

You must be informed then, that\break \textit{Gastripheres}, who had
taken a turn into the kitchen a little before dinner, to see 
\stck{how things went on\tsk observing a wicker-}\catch{basket}
basket of fine chesnuts
standing upon the dresser, had ordered that a hundred or two of
them might be roasted and sent\break in, as soon as dinner was
over\tsk \textit{Gastri\-pheres} inforcing his orders about
them, that \textit{Didius}, but \textit{Phutatorius} especially,\break
were particularly fond of ’em.

About two minutes before the time that my uncle \textit{Toby}
interrupted \textit{Yorick}’s
harangue\tsk \textit{Gastripheres}’s chesnuts were \tight{brought
in\tsk and as \textit{Phutatorius}’s fondness} for ’em,
was uppermost in the waiter’s head, he laid them directly
before \textit{Phutatorius}, wrapt up hot in a clean damask
napkin.

Now whether it was physically impossible, with half a dozen
hands all thrust into the napkin at a time\tsk but that some one
chesnut, of more life and rotundity\catch{than} than the rest, must be put in
motion\tsk\break
it so fell out, however, that one was\break
actually sent rolling off the table; and\break
as \textit{Phutatorius} sat straddling
under\tsk it\break fell perpendicularly into that particular
aperture of \textit{Phutatorius}’s breeches, for\break
which, to the shame and indelicacy of\break
our language be it spoke, there is no
chaste word throughout all \textit{Johnson}’s\break
dictionary\tsk let it suffice to say\tsk it was\break
\stck{that particular aperture which, in all good}
societies, the laws of decorum do strictly require, like the temple of \textit{Janus} (in
peace at least) to be universally shut up.

The neglect of this punctilio in \textit{Phutatorius} (which
by the bye should be a\break warning to all mankind) had opened a door to
this accident.\tsh

\medskip
\rightline{\tsk Accident,}
\newpage

\tsk Accident, I call it, in compliance to a received mode of
speaking,\tsk but in no opposition to the opinion either of
\textit{Acrites} or \textit{Mythogeras} in this matter; I know they
were both prepossessed and fully persuaded of it\tsk and are so
to this hour, That there was nothing of accident in the whole
event\tsh but that the chesnut’s taking that particular course, and
in a manner of its own accord\tsk and then falling with all its
heat directly into that one particular place, and no
other\tsh was a real judgment upon \textit{Phutatorius},\break
for that filthy and obscene treatise \textit{de Concubinis retinendis},
which \textit{Phutatorius} had published about twenty years
ago\tsh and was that identical week going to give the
world a second edition of.

It is not my business to dip my pen in this
controversy\tsh much undoubtedly\catch{may} may be wrote on both
sides of the question\tsk all that concerns me as an historian,
is to represent the matter of fact, and render it credible to the
reader, that the hiatus in \textit{Phutatorius}’s breeches was
sufficiently wide to receive the ches\-nut;\break\tsh and that the
chesnut, some how or other, did fall perpendicularly and piping hot
into it, without \textit{Phutatorius}’s perceiving it, or any
one else at that time.

The genial warmth which the chesnut\break imparted, was not
undelectable for the first twenty or five and twenty
seconds,\tsk and did no more than gently solicit
\textit{Phu\-tatorius}’s attention towards the
part:\tsk\break
But the heat gradually increasing, and in a few
seconds more getting beyond the point of all sober pleasure, and
then advancing with all speed into the regions of pain,\tsk the soul of
\textit{Phutatorius}, toge-\catch{ther} ther with all his ideas, his thoughts, his
attention, his imagination, judgment,\break
resolution, deliberation, ratiocination,\break
memory, fancy, with ten battalions of animal
spirits, all tumultuously crouded down, through different defiles
and circuits, to the place of danger, leaving all his upper
regions, as you may imagine, as empty as my purse.

With the best intelligence which all these messengers could
bring him back, \textit{Phutatorius} was not able to dive into the
secret of what was going forwards below, nor could he make any kind
of conjecture, what the devil was the matter with it: However, as
he knew not what the true cause might turn out, he deemed it most
prudent, in the situation he was in at present, to bear it,
if possible, like a stoick;
which, with the help of some\catch{wry}
wry faces and compursions of the
mouth, he had certainly accomplished, had his imagination continued
neuter\tsh but the sallies of the imagination are
ungovernable in things of this kind\tsk a thought instantly
darted into his mind, that tho’ the anguish had the sensation
of glowing heat\tsk it might, notwithstanding that, be a bite as
well as a burn; and if so, that possibly a \textit{Newt} or an
\textit{Asker}, or some such detested reptile, had crept up, and was
fastening his teeth\tsh the horrid idea of which, with a
fresh glow of pain arising that instant from the chesnut, seized
\textit{Phutatorius} with a sudden panick, and in the first
terrifying disorder of the passion it threw him, as it has done
the best generals upon earth, quite off his guard:\tsk the
effect of which was this, that he leapt incontinently up, uttering
as he rose that interjection of surprise so\catch{much} much discanted upon,
with the apo\-sio\-pestick break after it, marked thus,\break
Z\tsh ds\tsk which, though not strictly canonical, was still as little as any man
could have said upon the occasion;\tsh\break and which,
by the bye, whether canonical or not, \textit{Phutatorius} could no
more help than he could the cause of it.

Though this has taken up some time\break in the narrative, it took up
little more time in the transaction, than just to allow time for
\textit{Phutatorius} to draw forth the chesnut, and throw it down
with\break violence upon the floor\tsk and for
\textit{Yorick},\break to rise
from his chair, and pick the chesnut up.

It is curious to observe the triumph of slight incidents over
the mind:\tsh What incredible weight they have in forming\catch{and}
and governing our opinions, both of men and things,\tsk that
trifles, light as air, shall waft a belief into the soul,
and plant it so immoveably within it,\tsk that
\textit{Euclid}’s demonstrations, could they be brought to
batter it in breach, should not all have power to overthrow
it.

\textit{Yorick}, I said, picked up the chesnut which
\textit{Phutatorius}’s wrath had flung\break down\tsk the action
was trifling\tsk I am ashamed to account for it\tsk he did
it,\break
for no reason, but that he thought the chesnut not a jot
worse for the adventure\tsk \tight{and that he held a good chesnut}
worth stooping for.\tsk But this incident, trifling as it
was, wrought differently in \textit{Phutatorius}’s head: He
considered this act of \textit{Yorick}’s, in getting off his
chair, and picking up the chesnut, as a plain acknowledgment
in him, that the ches-\catch{nut} nut was originally his,\tsk and in
course, that it must have been the owner of the chesnut, and
no one else, who could have played him such a prank with it:\break
What greatly confirmed him in this opinion, was this, that
the table being pa\-rallelogramical and very narrow, it
afforded a fair opportunity for \textit{Yorick},\break
who sat directly over-against \textit{Phutatorius},\break
of slipping the chesnut in\tsk and consequently that he did it. The look of
something more than suspicion, which \textit{Phutatorius}
cast full upon \textit{Yorick} as these thoughts arose, too
evidently spoke his 
\stck{opinion\tsk and as \textit{Phutatorius} was naturally}
supposed to know more of the matter than any
person besides, his opinion at once became the general
one;\tsh and for a reason very different from any which have
been yet given\tsh\enlargethispage\baselineskip in a little time it was put out of all
manner of dispute.\patch{When}

When great or unexpected events fall out upon the stage of this
sublunary\break world\tsk the mind of man, which is an
inquisitive kind of a substance, naturally takes a flight behind
the scenes to see what is the cause and first spring
of\break
them\tsk The search was not long in this\break instance.

It was well known that \textit{Yorick} had\break
\stck{never a good opinion of the treatise which}\break
\textit{Phutatorius} had wrote \textit{de Concubinis
retinendis}, as a thing which he feared had done hurt in the
world\tsk and ’twas easily found out, that there was a
mystical meaning in \textit{Yorick}’s prank\tsk and that his
chucking the chesnut hot into \textit{Phutatorius}’s
\hbox{\astw3\tsk\astw5}, 
was a sarcastical fling at his book\tsk the doctrines
of which,\break they said, had enflamed many an honest man in the
same place.\patch{This}

This conceit awaken’d \textit{Somnolentus}\tsh made
\textit{Agelastes} smile\tsk and if you can\break recollect the
precise look and air of a man’s face intent in finding out a
riddle\tsk\stick{it threw \textit{Gastripheres}’s into that
form\tsk} and in short was thought by many to be a master-stroke
of arch-wit.

This, as the reader has seen from one end to the other, was as
groundless as\break the dreams of philosophy: \textit{Yorick}, no\break doubt, as
\textit{Shakespear} said of his ancestor\break\tsk\lqq\textit{was
a man of jest},\,” but it was tem\-per’d with something
which withheld him\break
from that, and many other ungracious\break pranks, of
which he as undeservedly\break
bore the blame;\tsk but it was his
misfortune all his life long to bear the imputation of saying and
doing a thousand \stck{things, of which (unless my esteem blinds} me) his
nature was incapable. All I\catch{blame}
blame him for\tsk or rather, all I blame and alternately like him for, was that
singularity of his temper, which would never suffer him to take pains to set a story
right with the world, however in his power. In every ill usage of that sort, he
acted precisely as in the affair of his lean horse\tsk he could have explained it to
his honour, but his spirit was above it; and besides, he ever looked upon the
inventor, the propagator and believer of an illiberal report alike so injurious to
him\tsk he could not stoop to tell his story to them\tsk and so trusted to time and
truth to do it for him.

This heroic cast produced him inconveniences in many
respects\tsk in the pre\-sent, it was followed by the fixed
resentment of \textit{Phutatorius}, who, as \textit{Yorick} had just
made an end of his chesnut, rose up\catch{from} from his chair a second time,
to let him know it\tsk which indeed he did with a smile; saying
only\tsk that he would endeavour not to forget the
obligation.

But you must mark and carefully separate and distinguish these
two things in your mind.

\tsk The smile was for the company.

\tsk The threat was for \textit{Yorick}.

rising up, and laying his right-hand with 
\stick{his fingers spread upon his breast\tsk had}
such a blunder about a christian-name
happened before the reformation\tsk (It 
\stck{happened the day before yesterday, quoth}
my uncle \textit{Toby} to himself) and when\break
baptism was administer’d in
\textit{Latin}\tsh\break
\stick{(’Twas all in \textit{English}, said my
uncle)}\break
\tsk Many things might have coincided\break with it, and
upon the authority of sundry decreed cases, to have pronounced the
baptism null, with a power of giving\catch{the}
\stick{the child a new name\tsk Had a priest, for}
\stck{instance, which was no uncommon thing,}
through ignorance of the \textit{Latin} tongue, baptized a child of
Tom-o’Stiles, \textit{in\break nomino patriæ \et\ filia \et\
spiritum sanctos},\break\tsk the baptism was held
null\tsk I beg your pardon, replied
\textit{Kysarcius},\tsk in that case, as the mistake was only
the \textit{terminations}, the baptism was valid\tsh and to
have rendered it null, the blunder of the priest should have fallen
upon the first syllable of each noun\tsh and not, as in
your case, upon the last.\tsk

My father delighted in subtleties of this kind, and
listen’d with infinite attention.

\textit{Gastripheres}, for example, continued \textit{Kysarcius},
baptizes a child of \textit{John\break Stradling}’s \textit{in Gomine}
gatris, \etc \et{\itshape c}.\catch{instead} instead of \textit{in Nomine} patris,
\etc\tsk Is this\break
a baptism? No,\tsk say the ablest cano\-nists; in as much as the radix of each word is hereby torn up,
and the sense\break
and meaning of them removed and\break
changed quite to another object; for\break
\textit{Gomine} does not signify a name, nor\break
\textit{gatris} a father\tsk What do they signify?\break
said my uncle \textit{Toby}\tsk Nothing at all\tsk\break
quoth \textit{Yorick}\tsk Ergo, such a baptism is\break
null, said \textit{Kysarcius}\tsk In course, answered\break
\textit{Yorick}, in a tone two parts jest and one\break
part earnest\tsk

But in the case cited, continued \textit{Kysarcius}, where
\textit{patrim} is put for \textit{patris}, \textit{filia}
for \textit{filij}, and so on\tsk as it is a fault only in
the declension, and the roots of the words continue
untouch’d, the inflexions of their branches, either this way
or\break that, does not in any sort hinder the\catch{baptism,} baptism,
inasmuch as the same sense\break continues in the words as
before.\tsk But then, said \textit{Didius}, the intention of
the priest’s pronouncing them grammatically, must have been
proved to have gone along with it\tsk Right, answered
\textit{Kysarcius}; and of this, brother \textit{Didius}, we
have an instance in a decree of the de\-cretals of Pope
\textit{Leo} the IIId.\tsk But my brother’s child, cried my
uncle \textit{Toby},\break
has nothing to do with the Pope\tsk ’tis\break
the plain child of a Protestant gentle-\break
man, christen’d \textit{Tristram} against the wills\break
and wishes both of his father and mother,\break
and all who are a-kin to it.\tsk

If the wills and wishes, said \textit{Kysarcius}, interrupting my
uncle \textit{Toby}, of those only who stand related to Mr.\@
\textit{Shandy}’s child, were to have weight in this matter,
Mrs.\@ \textit{Shandy}, of all people, has the\catch{least} least to do in
it.\tsk My uncle \textit{Toby} lay’d down his pipe, and my father drew his chair still closer to
the table, to hear the conclusion of so strange an
introduction.

It has not only been a question,\break captain \textit{Shandy}, amongst the
\lower-3pt\hbox{\ast} best law\-yers and civilians in this land,
continued \textit{Kys\-arcius}, \lqq\textit{Whether the
mother be of kin}\break
\lqq \textit{to her child},\,”\tsk but, after much
dispas\-sionate enquiry and jactitation of the arguments on
all sides\tsk it has been adjudged for the negative\tsk
namely, \lqq\textit{That}\break
\lqq \textit{the mother is not of kin to her child}\,\dagger.”\break
My father instantly clapp’d his hand\break
upon my uncle \textit{Toby}’s mouth, under co\-lour of whispering in his
ear\tsk the truth\break
was, he was alarmed for \textit{Lillabullero}\tsk\break

of so curious an argument\tsk he begg’d my
uncle \textit{Toby}, for heaven’s sake, not to disappoint him in it\tsk My uncle
\textit{Toby} gave a nod\tsk resumed his pipe, and
content-\break ing himself with whistling
\textit{Lillabullero}\break
inwardly\tsh \textit{Kysarcius}, \textit{Didius}, and
\textit{Triptolemus} went on with the discourse as follows.

This determination, continued \textit{Kysarcius}, how
contrary soever it may seem\break
to run to the stream of vulgar ideas,\break
yet had reason strongly on its side; and has been put out of all
manner of dispute from the famous case, known commonly by the name
of the Duke of \textit{Suffolk}’s case:\tsh It is
cited in \textit{Brook}, said \textit{Triptolemus}\tsh And
taken notice of by Lord \textit{Coke}, added \textit{Didius}\tsk And
you may find it in \textit{Swinburn} on Testaments, said
\textit{Kysarcius.}\patch{The}

The case, Mr.\@ \textit{Shandy}, was this.

In the reign of \textit{Edward} the Sixth,\break
\textit{Charles} Duke of \textit{Suffolk} having issue a son
by one venter, and a daughter by\break
another venter, made his last will,\break
wherein he devised goods to his son,\break
and died; after whose death the son died also\tsk but
without will, without wife, and without child\tsk his mother and
his sister by the father’s side (for she was born of the
former venter) then living. The mother took the administration of
her son’s goods, according to the statute of the 21st of \textit{Harry} the Eighth, whereby it is
enacted, That in case any person\break die intestate, the administration
of his goods shall be committed to the next\break of kin.\patch{The}

The administration being thus (surreptitiously) granted to the
mother, the sister by the father’s side commenced a suit
before the Ecclesiastical Judge, al\-ledging, 1st, That she herself
was next of kin; and 2dly, That the mother was not of kin at all to
the party deceased;\break and therefore pray’d the court, that the
administration granted to the mother\break might be revoked, and be
committed\break unto her, as next of kin to the deceased, by force of the
said statute.

Hereupon, as it was a great cause, and much depending upon its issue\tsk and many
causes of great property likely to be decided in times to come, by the precedent to
be then made\tsh the most learned, as well in the laws of this realm, as in the
civil law, were consulted together, whether the mother was
of kin to\catch{her} her son, or no.
\tsk Whereunto not only the temporal lawyers\tsk but the church lawyers\tsk the
juris consulti\tsk the juris-prudentes\tsk the civilians\tsk the advocates\tsk the
commissaries\tsk the judges of the consistory and prerogative courts of
\textit{Canterbury} and \textit{York}, with the master of the faculties, were all
unanimously of opinion, That the mother was not of \fnast\break
kin to her child.\tsh

And what said the Duchess of \textit{Suffolk} to it? said my uncle
\textit{Toby}.

The unexpectedness of my uncle\break
\textit{Toby}’s question, confounded \textit{Kysarcius}\break
more than the ablest advocate\tsh He\break
stopp’d a full minute, looking in my\break
uncle \textit{Toby}’s face without replying\tsh\break
\rightline{and}

\newpage\noindent
and in that single minute \textit{Triptolemus} put by him, and took the lead as
follows.

’Tis a ground and principle in the law, said \textit{Triptolemus}, that things do
not ascend, but descend in it; and I make no doubt ’tis for this cause, that however
true it is, that the child may be of the blood and seed of its parents\tsk that the
parents, nevertheless, are not of the\break blood and seed of it; inasmuch as the parents
are not begot by the child, but\break the child by the parents\tsk For so they write,
\textit{Liberi sunt de sanguine patris \et\break matris, sed
pater et mater non sunt de sanguine liberorum.}

\tsk But this, \textit{Triptolemus}, cried \textit{Didius}, proves too much\tsk for from this
authority cited it would follow, not only\break
what indeed is granted on all sides,\catch{that}
that the mother is not of kin to her\break
child\tsk but the father likewise\tsh It is\break 
held, said \textit{Triptolemus}, the better opi-\break
nion; because the father, the mother,\break
and the child, though they be three\break
persons, yet are they but (\textit{una caro} \fnast)\break
one flesh; and consequently no degree\break
of kindred\tsk or any method of acquiring 
one \textit{in nature.}\tsk There you push the argument again too far,
cried \textit{Didius}\tsh\break
for there is no prohibition \textit{in nature},\break
though there is in the levitical law,\tsk\break
but that a man may beget a child upon\break
his grandmother\tsh in which case, supposing
the issue a daughter, she would stand in relation both
of\tsh But who\break
ever thought, cried \textit{Kysarcius}, of laying with his
grandmother?\tsk The young\break
gentleman, replied \textit{Yorick}, whom \textit{Selden}\break
speaks of\tsk who not only thought of it,\break
\rightline{but}\etp\break

but justified his intention to his father\break
by the argument drawn from the law\break

\lqq may not I lay with yours?”\tsk ’Tis\break
the \textit{Argumentum commune}, added

\dropcap{T}{hough} my father was hugely\break tickled
with the subtleties of these\break learned
discourses\tsh ’twas still but like the anointing of
a broken bone\tsh The\break
moment he got home, the weight of\break
his afflictions returned upon him but so much the heavier, as is
ever the case when the staff we lean on slips from under
us\tsk He became pensive\tsk walked frequently forth to the
fish-pond\tsk let down one loop of his
hat\tsh sigh’d often\break\tsh forbore to
snap\tsk and, as the hasty sparks of temper, which occasion
snapping, so much assist perspiration and digestion, as
\textit{Hippocrates} tells us\tsk he had certainly fallen ill with
the extinction of them, had not his thoughts been criti-\catch{cally} cally drawn
off, and his health rescued by a fresh train of disquietudes left
him, with a legacy of a thousand pounds by my aunt
\textit{Dinah}\tsk

My father had scarce read the letter, when taking the thing by
the right end, 
\stick{he instantly began to plague and puzzle}
\stick{his head how to lay it out mostly to}
\stick{the honour of his family.\tsk A hundred}
\stick{and fifty odd projects took possession}
\stick{of his brains by turns\tsk he would do}
\stick{this, and that, and to’ther\tsk He would}\sic\break
\stick{go to \textit{Rome}\tsk he would go to law\tsk he}
\stick{would buy stock\tsk he would buy \textit{John}}
\stick{\textit{Hobson}’s farm\tsk he would new fore-front}
\stick{his house, and add a new wing to make}
\stick{it even\tsk There was a fine water-mill on}
this side, and he would build a wind-mill on the
other side of the river in full view to answer it\tsk But above
all\catch{things} things in the world, he would inclose the great \textit{Ox-moor}, 
and send out my brother \textit{Bobby} immediately upon his
travels.

But as the sum was \textit{finite}, and consequently could not do
every thing\tsk and in truth very few of these to any
purpose,\tsk of all the projects which offered themselves
upon this occasion, the two last seemed to make the deepest
impression; and he would infallibly have determined upon
both at once, but for the small inconvenience hinted at
above, which absolutely put him under a necessity of
deciding in favour either of the one or the other.

This was not altogether so easy to be done; for though
’tis certain my father had long before set his heart upon
this necessary part of my brother’s education,\catch{and} and like a
prudent man had actually\break
determined to carry it into execution,\break
with the first money that returned from the second creation of
actions in the \textit{Missisippi}-scheme, in which he was an
adventurer\tsh yet the \textit{Ox-moor}, which was a fine,
large, whinny, undrained, unim-\break
\tight{proved common, belonging to the \textit{Shandy}-}\break
estate, had almost as old a claim upon him: he had
long and affectionately set 
\stck{his heart upon turning it likewise to some}
account.

\tight{But having never hitherto been pressed} with such a conjuncture
of things, as made it necessary to settle either the\break priority or justice of their
claims,\tsk like a
wise man he had refrained entering into any nice or critical
examination about them: So that upon the dismission of every other
project at this crisis,\tsh\catch{the} the two old projects, the
\textsc{Ox-moor} and my \textsc{Brother}, divided him
again; and so equal a match were they for each other, as to become
the occasion of no small contest in the old gentleman’s
mind,\tsk which of the two should be set o’going first.

\tsk People may laugh as they will\tsh but the case
was this.

It had ever been the custom of the family, and by length of time
was almost become a matter of common right, that the eldest son of
it should have free ingress, egress, and regress into foreign parts
before marriage,\tsk not only for the sake of bettering his own
private parts, by the benefit of exercise and change of so much
air\tsk but simply for the mere delectation of his fancy, by the
feather\catch{put}
put into his cap, of having been abroad\break
\tsk \textit{tantum valet}, my father would say,
\textit{quantum sonat}.

Now as this was a reasonable, and in course a most christian
indulgence\tsh to deprive him of it, without why or\break
wherefore,\tsh and thereby make an example of him, as the
first \textit{Shandy} unwhirl’d about \textit{Europe} in a
post-chaise, and only because he was a heavy lad\tsh would
be using him ten times worse than a \textit{Turk.}

On the other hand, the case of the\break \textit{Ox-moor} was full as
hard.

Exclusive of the original purchase-\break
money, which was eight hundred pounds\break
\tsk it had cost the family eight hundred
pounds more in a law-suit about fifteen\catch{years}
years before\tsk besides the Lord knows what trouble and vexation.

It had been moreover in possession of the \textit{Shandy}-family
ever since the middle of the last century; and though it lay full
in view before the house, bounded on one extremity by the
water-mill, and on the other by the projected wind-mill
spoken of above,\tsk and for all these reasons
seemed to have the fairest title of any part of the estate to the
care and protection of the family\tsk yet by an unaccountable
fatality, common to men, as well as the ground they tread
on,\tsk it had all along most shamefully been
overlook’d; and to speak the truth of it, had suffered so
much by it, that it would have made any man’s heart have bled
\sic\textit{( Obadiah} said ) who understood the value of the land, to have
rode over\catch{it,} it, and only seen the condition it was in.

However, as neither the purchasing this tract of
ground\tsk nor indeed the placing of it where it lay, were either
of them, properly speaking, of my father’s
doing\tsk he had never thought himself any way concerned
in the affair\tsk till the fifteen years before, when the
breaking out of that cursed law-suit mentioned above (and which had
arose about its boundaries)\tsk which being altogether my
father’s own act and deed, it naturally awakened every other
argument in its favour; and upon summing them all up
together, he saw, not merely in interest, but in honour, he was
bound to do something for it\tsk and that now or never was
the time.\patch{I think}

I think there must certainly have been a mixture of ill-luck in
it, that the reasons on both sides should happen to be so equally
balanced by each other; for though my father weigh’d them in
all\break humours and conditions\tsk spent many an anxious hour
in the most profound and abstracted meditation upon what was\break
best to be done\tsh reading books of farming one
day\tsk books of travels another\tsk laying aside
all passion whatever\break\tsk viewing the arguments on both sides in
all their lights and circumstances\tsk\break communing every day with
my uncle\break \textit{Toby}\tsk arguing with \textit{Yorick}, and talking
over the whole affair of the \textit{Ox-moor}\break with
\textit{Obadiah}\tsk yet nothing in all that time appeared
so strongly in behalf of the one, which was not either
strictly\break
applicable to the other, or at least so\break far counterbalanced
by some considera-\catch{tion}
tion of equal weight, as to keep the scales even.

For to be sure, with proper helps,\break
and in the hands of some people, tho’\break
the \textit{Ox-moor} would undoubtedly have\break
made a different appearance in the world from what it did, or ever would
do in the condition it lay\tsk yet every tittle of this
was true, with regard to my brother \textit{Bobby}\tsk let
\textit{Obadiah} say what he\break
would.\tsh

In point of interest\tsk the contest, I own, at first
sight, did not appear so\break
undecisive betwixt them; for whenever my
father took pen and ink in hand,\break and set about calculating the
simple expence of paring and burning, and fence\-ing in the
\textit{Ox-moor}, \&c.\@ \&c.\tsk with the\break
certain profit it would bring him in\catch{return} return\tsk the latter turned out so
prodigiously in his way of working the account, that you would have
sworn the \textit{Ox-moor} would have carried all before it. For it
was plain he should reap a hundred lasts of rape, at twenty pounds a last, the very first
year\tsk besides an excellent crop of wheat the year
following\tsk and the year after that, to speak within
bounds, a hundred\tsh but, in all likelihood, a hundred and
fifty\tsk if not two hundred quarters of pease and
beans\tsk besides potatoes without end\tsk But
then, to think he was all this while breeding up my brother, like a
hog to eat them\tsk knocked all on the head again, and
generally left the old gentleman in such a state of
suspence\tsk that, as he often declared to my uncle
\textit{Toby}\tsk he knew no more than his heels what to
do.\patch{No}

No body, but he who has felt it, can conceive what a plaguing
thing it is to have a man’s mind torn asunder by two projects
of equal strength, both obsti-\break nately pulling in a contrary direction
at the same time: For to say nothing of\break
the havock, which by a certain conse\-quence is unavoidably made by it all\break
over the finer system of the nerves,\break
which you know convey the animal\break
spirits and more subtle juices from the heart to the head, and so on\tsk It is\break
not to be told in what a degree such a wayward kind of friction works
upon the more gross and solid parts, wasting the fat and impairing
the strength of a man every time as it goes backwards and
forwards.

My father had certainly sunk under this evil, as certainly as he
had done\catch{under} under that of my \ls{\textsc{christian
name}}\tsh\break had he not been rescued out of it as\break
he was out of that, by a fresh evil\tsh\break the misfortune of my
brother \textit{Bobby}’s\break death.

What is the life of man! Is it not to shift from side to
side?\tsk from sorrow to sorrow?\tsh to button up
one cause of vexation!\tsk and unbutton another!

and my next chapter to it, that is, the\break
first chapter of my next volume, if I live,\break
shall be my chapter upon \lss{\textsc{whiskers}},\catch{in}
in order to keep up some sort of connection in my works.

The thing I lament is, that things\break
have crowded in so thick upon me,\break
that I have not been able to get into\break
that part of my work, towards which,\break
I have all the way, looked forwards,\break
with so much earnest desire; and that is\break
the campaigns, but especially the amours\break
of my uncle \textit{Toby}, the events of which\break
are of so singular a nature, and so Cer-\break
vantick a cast, that if I can so manage\break
it, as to convey but the same impressions\break

No wonder I itch so much as I do,\break to get at these

\stick{when I do get at ’em\tsk assure yourselves,}
\stick{good folks,\tsk (nor do I value whose}

I shall not be at all nice in the choice of my words;\tsh
and that’s the thing I have to \textit{declare}.\tsk I shall
never get all through in five minutes, that I fear\tsh and

and which is the right and which the wrong end of a woman, is the thing to be

one chapter before.


And now that you have just got to\break
the end of these four volumes\tsk\tsk the\break
thing I have to \textit{ask} is, how you feel\break
your heads? my own akes dismally\tsk\break
as for your healths, I know, they are\break
much better\tsh True \textit{Shandeism}, think\break
what you will against it, opens the\break
heart and lungs, and like all those affections which
partake of its nature, it forces the blood and other vital
fluids of the body to run freely thro’ its channels,\catch{and} and makes
the wheel of life run long and chearfully round.

Was I left like \textit{Sancho Pança}, to\break
chuse my kingdom, it should not be\break
maritime\tsk or a kingdom of blacks to make a penny of\tsh no, it should\break
be a kingdom of hearty laughing subjects: And as the bilious and more
sa\-turnine passions, by creating disorders\break
in the blood and humours, have as bad\break
\stick{an influence, I see, upon the body politick}
\stick{as body natural\tsh and as nothing but a}
habit of virtue can fully govern those passions, and subject them to
reason\tsh I should add to my prayer\tsk that God would give
my subjects grace to be as \textscl{wise} as they were
\textscl{merry}; and then\break should I be the happiest monarch,
and they the happiest people under heaven\tsk\patch{And}

And so, with this moral for the pre-\break

your reverences, I take my leave of you\break
