\stick{how much depended upon what they}

his mind;\tsk and, for aught they knew to the contrary, even the fortunes of his
whole house might take their turn from 
\stck{the humours and dispositions which were}
\stick{then uppermost:\tsk Had they duly}
\stick{weighed and considered all this, and}
\stick{proceeded accordingly,\tsk I am verily}
\stick{persuaded I should have made a quite}
\stick{different figure in the world, from that,}
\stick{in which the reader is likely to see me.\tsk}
\stick{Believe me, good folks, this is not so}

\stck{heard of the animal spirits, as how they are}

\stick{you may take my word, that nine parts}
\stick{in ten of a man’s sense or his nonsense,}
\stick{his successes and miscarriages in this}
\stick{world depend upon their motions and ac-}
\natch{tivity,}
\stick{tivity, and the different tracks and trains}
\stick{you put them into, so that when they}
\stick{are once set a-going, whether right or} 
\stck{wrong, ’tis not a halfpenny matter,\tsk away}
\stick{they go cluttering like hey-go-mad; and}

\stick{as plain and as smooth as a garden-walk,}
\stick{which, when they are once used to, the}
\stick{Devil himself sometimes shall not be able to}
drive them off it.

\textit{Pray, my dear,} quoth my mother, \textit{have}\break

\qquad \tsh Then, positively, there is nothing\break
\stick{in the question, that I can see, either good}
\stick{or bad.\tsk Then, let me tell you, Sir,}
\stick{it was a very unseasonable question at}
\stick{least,\tsk because it scattered and dispersed}
\stick{the animal spirits, whose business it was} 
\stick{to have escorted and gone hand-in-hand} 
\stick{with the \lss{\itshape HOMUNCULUS}, and con-}
\stick{ducted him safe to the place destined for}
his reception.

The \textscl{Homunculus}, Sir, in how-ever\break
\stick{low and ludicrous a light he may appear,}
\stick{in this age of levity, to the eye of folly} 
\stick{or prejudice:\tsk to the eye of reason in} 
\stck{scientifick research, he stands confess’d\tsk}
\stick{a \textscl{Being} guarded and circumscribed with} 
\stick{rights:\tsh The minutest philosophers,}
\natch{who,}
\stick{who, by the bye, have the most enlarged} 
\stick{understandings, (their souls being in-}
\stick{versely as their enquiries) shew us incon-}
\stick{testably, That the \textscl{Homunculus} is}
\stick{created by the same hand,\tsk engender’d} 
\stick{in the same course of nature,\tsk endowed}
\stick{with the same loco-motive powers and} 
\stick{faculties with us:\tsk That he consists,}
\stick{as we do, of skin, hair, fat, flesh, veins,}
\stick{arteries, ligaments, nerves, cartileges,}
\stick{bones, marrow, brains, glands, genitals,}
\stick{humours, and articulations;\tsk is a Be-}
\stick{ing of as much activity,\tsk and, in all}

\stick{our fellow-creature as my Lord Chancel-}

\stick{and rights of humanity, which \textit{Tully},}
\stick{\textit{Puffendorff}, or the best ethick writers}
\natch{allow} 
\stick{allow to arise out of that state and rela-}

Now, dear Sir, what if any accident\break 
\stick{had befallen him in his way alone?\tsk}
\stick{or that, thro’ terror of it, natural to so}
\stick{young a traveller, my little gentleman} 
\stick{had got to his journey’s end miserably} 
\stick{spent;\tsk his muscular strength and}
\stick{virility worn down to a thread;\tsk his}
\stick{own animal spirits ruffled beyond de-}

\stick{state of nerves, he had laid down a prey} 
\stick{to sudden starts, or a series of melan-}
\stick{choly dreams and fancies for nine long,}
\stick{long months together.\tsh I tremble to}
\stick{think what a foundation had been laid}
\stick{for a thousand weaknesses both of body}

\dropcap{T}{o} my uncle Mr.\@ \textit{Toby Shandy} do~I\break
stand indebted for the preceding\break
\stick{anecdote, to whom my father, who was}
\stick{an excellent natural philosopher, and}
\stick{much given to close reasoning upon the}
\stick{smallest matters, had oft, and heavily,}
\stick{complain’d of the injury; but once more}
\stick{particularly, as my uncle \textit{Toby} well re-}
\stick{member’d, upon his observing a most}
\stick{unaccountable obliquity, (as he call’d it)}
\stick{in my manner of setting up my top, and} 
\stick{justifying the principles upon which I}
\stick{had done it,\tsk the old gentleman shook}
\stick{his head, and in a tone more expressive} 
\stick{by half of sorrow than reproach,\tsk he said} 
\stick{his heart all along foreboded, and he}
\stick{saw it verified in this, and from a thou-}
\stick{sand other observations he had made up-}
\natch{on}
\stick{on me, That I should neither think nor}
\stick{act like any other man’s child:\tsh \textit{But}}
\stick{\textit{alas!} continued he, shaking his head a}
\stick{second time, and wiping away a tear} 
\stick{which was trickling down his cheeks,} 
\stck{\textit{My Tristram’s misfortunes began nine months}}
\textit{before ever he came into the world}.

\tsh My mother, who was sitting by,\break
\stick{look’d up,\tsk but she knew no more than}
\stick{her backside what my father meant,\tsk but}
\stick{my uncle, Mr.\@ \textit{Toby Shandy}, who had}
\stick{been often informed of the affair,\tsk un-}

\initial{I}{Know} there are readers in the world,\break
as well as many other good people\break
\stick{in it, who are no readers at all,\tsk who}
\natch{find} 
\stick{find themselves ill at ease, unless they are} 
\stick{let into the whole secret from first to last,} 
of every thing which concerns you.

It is in pure compliance with this hu-\break
\stick{mour of theirs, and from a backwardness} 
\stick{in my nature to disappoint any one soul}
\stick{living, that I have been so very particu-}
\stick{lar already. As my life and opinions are}
\stick{likely to make some noise in the world,} 
\stick{and, if I conjecture right, will take in all}
\stick{ranks, professions, and denominations of} 
\stick{men whatever,\tsk be no less read than the}
\stick{\textit{Pilgrim’s Progress} itself\tsk and, in the end,}
\stick{prove the very thing which \textit{Montaigne}}
\stick{dreaded his essays should turn out, that} 
\stick{is, a book for a parlour-window;\tsk I find} 
\stick{it necessary to consult every one a little} 
\stick{in his turn; and therefore must beg par-}
\stick{don for going on a little further in the} 
\stick{same way: For which cause, right glad}
\natch{I}
\stick{I am, that I have begun the history of}
\stick{myself in the way I have done; and}
\stick{that I am able to go on tracing every} 
thing in it, as \textit{Horace} says, \textit{ab Ovo}.

\textit{Horace}, I know, does not recommend\break
\stick{this fashion altogether: But that gentle-}
\stick{man is speaking only of an epic poem or}
\stick{a tragedy;\tsk (I forget which)\tsk besides,}
\stick{if it was not so, I should beg Mr.\@ \textit{Horace}’s}
\stick{pardon;\tsk for in writing what I have set}
\stick{about, I shall confine myself neither to}
\stick{his rules, nor to any man’s rules that ever}
lived.

To such, however, as do not choose to\break 
\stick{go so far back into these things, I can}
\stick{give no better advice, than that they}
\stick{skip over the remaining part of this} 
\stick{Chapter; for I declare before hand, ’tis}
\natch{wrote}
\stick{wrote only for the curious and inquisi-}
tive.

\noindent
\stick{\indent\tsfill\hbox{Shut the door.}\tsfill}
\stick{I was begot in the night, betwixt the first}
\stick{\textit{Sunday} and the first \textit{Monday} in the month} 
\stick{of \textit{March}, in the year of our Lord one} 
\stick{thousand seven hundred and eighteen.}
\stick{I am positive I was.\tsk But how I came}
\stick{to be so very particular in my account}
\stick{of a thing which happened before I was}
\stick{born, is owing to another small anecdote}
\stick{known only in our own family, but now}
\stick{made publick for the better clearing up} 
this point.

My father, you must know, who was\break
\stick{originally a \textit{Turkey} merchant, but had left}
\stick{off business for some years, in order to}
\stick{retire to, and die upon, his paternal estate}
\stick{in the county of\tsfill,  was, I believe,}
\natch{one} 
\stick{one of the most regular men in every} 
\stick{thing he did, whether ’twas matter of}
\stick{business, or matter of amusement, that} 
\stick{ever lived. As a small specimen of this}
\stick{extreme exactness of his, to which he}
\stick{was in truth a slave,\tsk he had made it a} 
\stick{rule for many years of his life,\tsk on the} 
\stck{first \textit{Sunday night} of every month through-}
\stick{out the whole year,\tsk as certain as ever} 
\stck{the \textit{Sunday night} came,\tsh to wind up a} 
\stick{large house-clock which we had standing}
\stick{upon the back-stairs head, with his own}
\stick{hands:\tsk And being somewhere between}
\stick{fifty and sixty years of age, at the time I}
\stick{have been speaking of,\tsk he had likewise} 
\stick{gradually brought some other little fa-}
\stick{mily concernments to the same period,}
\stick{in order, as he would often say to my}
\stick{uncle \textit{Toby}, to get them all out of the}
\stick{way at one time, and be no more plagued}
\natch{and}
\stick{and pester’d with them the rest of the} 
month.

It was attended but with one misfor-\break
\stick{tune, which, in a great measure, fell upon}
\stick{myself, and the effects of which I fear}
\stick{I shall carry with me to my grave;}
\stck{namely, that, from an unhappy association}
\stick{of ideas which have no connection in na-}
\stick{ture, it so fell out at length, that my} 
\stick{poor mother could never hear the said} 
\stick{clock wound up,\tsk but the thoughts of} 
\stick{some other things unavoidably popp’d} 
\stick{into her head,\tsk \et\ \textit{vice versâ:}\tsk which}
\stick{strange combination of ideas, the saga-}
\stick{cious \textit{Locke}, who certainly understood}
\stick{the nature of these things better than} 
\stick{most men, affirms to have produced}
\stick{more wry actions than all other sources}
of prejudice whatsoever.\\\indent
But this by the bye.\patch{Now}

Now it appears, by a memorandum in\break
\stick{my father’s pocket-book, which now lies} 
\stick{upon the table, \lqq That on \textit{Lady-Day},} 
\stick{which was on the 25th of the same month} 
\stick{in which I date my geniture,\tsk my father}
\stick{set out upon his journey to \textit{London} with}
\stick{my eldest brother \textit{Bobby}, to fix him at}
\stick{\textit{Westminster} school;” and, as it appears} 
\stick{from the same authority, \lqq That he did} 
\stick{not get down to his wife and family till} 
\stick{the \textit{second week} in \textit{May} following,\,”\tsk it} 
\stick{brings the thing almost to a certainty.}
\stick{However, what follows in the beginning} 
\stick{of the next chapter puts it beyond all}
possibility of doubt.

\tsh But pray, Sir, What was your\break

the same village where my father\break
and my mother dwelt, dwelt also a\break
\stick{thin, upright, motherly, notable, good}
\stick{old body of a midwife, who, with the}
\stick{help of a little plain good sense, and} 
\stick{some years full employment in her busi-}
\stick{ness, in which she had all along trusted} 
\stick{little to her own efforts, and a great deal}
\stick{to those of dame nature,\tsk had acquired,} 
\stick{in her way, no small degree of reputati-}
\stick{on in the world;\tsk by which word \textit{world},} 
\stick{need I in this place inform your worship,}
\natch{that}
\stick{that I would be understood to mean no} 
\stick{more of it, than a small circle described} 
\stick{upon the circle of the great world, of}
\stick{four \textit{English} miles diameter, or there-}
\stick{abouts, of which the cottage where the}
\stick{good old woman lived, is supposed to be}
\stick{the centre.\tsh She had been left it\sic,}
\stick{seems, a widow in great distress, with} 
\stick{three or four small children, in her forty-}
\stick{seventh year; and as she was at that time}
\stick{a person of decent carriage,\tsk grave de-}
\stick{portment,\tsk a woman moreover of few}
\stick{words, and withall an object of compas-}
\stick{sion, whose distress and silence under it}
\stick{call’d out the louder for a friendly lift:}
\stick{the wife of the parson of the parish was} 
\stick{touch’d with pity; and having often la-}
\stick{mented an inconvenience, to which her} 
\stick{husband’s flock had for many years been} 
\stick{exposed, inasmuch, as there was no such}
\stick{thing as a midwife, of any kind or de-}
\natch{gree} gree to be got at, let the case have been never so urgent, within
less than six or 
\stck{seven long miles riding; which said seven}
\stick{long miles in dark nights and dismal} 
\stick{roads, the country thereabouts being no-}
\stick{thing but a deep clay, was almost equal to}
\stck{fourteen; and that in effect was sometimes} 
\stick{next to having no midwife at all; it came}
\stick{into her head, that it would be doing as} 
\stck{seasonable a kindness to the whole parish,}
\stick{as to the poor creature herself, to get}
\stick{her a little instructed in some of the plain}
\stick{principles of the business, in order to set}
\stick{her up in it. As no woman thereabouts}
\stick{was better qualified to execute the plan}
\stick{she had formed than herself, the Gentle-}
\stck{woman very charitably undertook it; and}
\stick{having great influence over the female}
\stick{part of the parish, she found no difficulty}
\stick{in effecting it to the utmost of her wishes.} 
\stick{In truth, the parson join’d his interest}
\natch{with} 
\stick{with his wife’s in the whole affair; and}
\stick{in order to do things as they should be,} 
\stick{and give the poor soul as good a title by}
\stick{law to practise, as his wife had given by}
\stick{institution,\tsk he chearfully paid the}
\stick{fees for the ordinaries licence himself,}
\stick{amounting, in the whole, to the sum of}
\stick{eighteen shillings and fourpence; so that,}
\stick{betwixt them both, the good woman}
\stick{was fully invested in the real and corpo-}
\stick{ral possession of her office, together with}
\stick{all its \textit{rights}, \textit{members}, \textit{and appurtenances}}
\textit{whatsoever}.

These last words, you must know,\break
\stick{were not according to the old form in} 
\stck{which such licences, faculties, and powers}
\stick{usually ran, which in like cases had here-}
\stick{tofore been granted to the sisterhood.} 
\stick{But it was according to a neat \textit{Formula}} 
\stick{of \textit{Didius} his own devising, who having}
\natch{a} 
\stick{a particular turn for taking to pieces,}
\stick{and new framing over again, all kind of}
\stick{instruments in that way, not only hit}
\stick{upon this dainty amendment, but coax’d}
\stick{many of the old licensed matrons in the}
\stick{neighbourhood, to open their faculties}

\initial{I}{Solemnly} declare to all mankind, that\break
the above dedication was made for\break
\stick{no one Prince, Prelate, Pope, or Poten-}
\stick{tate,\tsk Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount,} 
\stick{or Baron of this, or any other Realm in}

\stick{hawk’d about, or offered publickly or}
\stick{privately, directly or indirectly, to any} 
\stick{one person or personage, great or small;}
\stick{but is honestly a true Virgin-Dedication}
untried on, upon any soul living.

I labour this point so particularly,\break 
\stick{merely to remove any offence or objec-}
\stick{tion which might arise against it, from}
\stick{the manner in which I propose to make} 
\stick{the most of it;\tsk which is the putting}
\natch{it} 
\stick{it up fairly to publick sale; which I now} 
do.

\tsh Every author has a way of his\break
\stick{own, in bringing his points to bear;\tsk for}
\stick{my own part, as I hate chaffering and}
\stick{higgling for a few guineas in a dark}
\stick{entry;\tsk I resolved within myself, from}
\stick{the very beginning, to deal squarely and} 
\stick{openly with your Great Folks in this af-}
\stick{fair,  and try whether I should not come}
off the better by it.

If therefore there is any one Duke,\break 
\stick{Marquis, Earl, Viscount, or Baron, in}
\stck{these his Majesty’s dominions, who  stands}
\stick{in need of a tight, genteel dedication,}
\stick{and whom the above will suit, (for by}
\stick{the bye, unless it suits in some degree, I}
\stick{will not part with it)\tsh it is much at}
\stick{his service for fifty guineas;\tsh which}
\natch{I}
\stick{I am positive is twenty guineas less than}
\stick{it ought to be afforded for, by any man}
of genius.

My Lord, if you examine it over\break 
\stick{again, it is far from being a gross piece}
\stick{of daubing, as some dedications are.}
\stick{The design, your Lordship sees, is good,} 
\stick{the colouring transparent,\tsk the drawing}
\stick{not amiss;\tsk or to speak more like a man} 
\stick{of science,\tsk and measure my piece in the} 
\stick{painter’s scale, divided into 20,\tsk I be-}
\stick{lieve, my Lord, the out-lines will turn}
\stick{out as 12,\tsk the composition as 9,\tsk the} 
\stick{colouring as 6,\tsk the expression 13 and} 
\stick{a half,\tsk and the design,\tsk if I may be} 
\stick{allowed, my Lord, to understand my own}
\stick{\textit{design}, and supposing absolute perfecti-}
\stick{on in designing, to be as 20,\tsk I think it} 
\stick{cannot well fall short of 19. Besides}
\stick{all this,\tsk there is keeping in it, and}
\natch{the} 
\stick{the dark strokes in the \textscl{Hobby-Horse},}
\stick{(which is a secondary figure, and a kind} 
\stick{of back-ground to the whole) give great} 
\stick{force to the principal lights in your own} 
\stick{figure, and make it come off wonder-}
\stick{fully;\tsk and besides, there is an air of}
originality in the \textit{tout ensemble}.

Be pleased, my good Lord, to order\break
\stick{the sum to be paid into the hands of Mr.}
\stick{\textit{Dodsley}, for the benefit of the author;}

\initial[findent=2pt, nindent=0pt]{W}{Hatever} 
degree of small merit,\break 
the act of benignity in favour of\break
\stick{the midwife, might justly claim, or in}
\stick{whom that claim truly rested,\tsk at first}
\stick{sight seems not very material to this}
\stick{history;\tsh certain however it was, that}
\stick{the gentlewoman, the parson’s wife, did}
\stick{run away at that time with the whole}
\stick{of it: And yet, for my life, I cannot help}
\stick{thinking but that the parson himself,}
\natch{tho’} 
\stick{tho’ he had not the good fortune to hit}
\stick{upon the design first,\tsk yet, as he heartily}
\stick{concurred in it the moment it was laid}
\stick{before him, and as heartily parted with}
\stick{his money to carry it into execution,} 
\stick{had a claim to some share of it,\tsk if not}
\stick{to a full half of whatever honour was}
due to it.

The world at that time was pleased to\break
determine the matter otherwise.

Lay down the book, and I will allow\break
\stick{you half a day to give a probable guess}
at the grounds of this procedure.

Be it known then, that, for about five\break
\stick{years before the date of the midwife’s} 
\stick{licence, of which you have had so cir-}
\stick{cumstantial an account,\tsk the parson we}
\stick{have to do with, had made himself a}
\natch{country-} 
\stick{country-talk by a breach of all decorum,} 
\stick{which he had committed against himself,}
\stick{his station, and his office;\tsk and that}
\stick{was, in never appearing better, or other-}
\stick{wise mounted, than upon a lean, sorry,}
\stick{jack-ass of a horse, value about one}
\stick{pound fifteen shillings; who, to shorten}
\stick{all description of him, was full brother to} 
\stick{\textit{Rosinante}, as far as similitude congenial}
\stick{could make him; for he answered his}
\stick{description to a hair-breadth in every}
\stick{thing,\tsk except that I do not remember}
\stick{’tis any where said, that \textit{Rosinante} was} 
\stck{broken winded; and that, moreover, \textit{Rosi-}}
\stick{\textit{nante}, as is the happiness of most \textit{Spanish}} 
\stick{horses, fat or lean,\tsk was uudoubtedly\sic a} 
horse at all points.

I know very well that the \textscl{Hero}’s\break
\stick{horse was a horse of chaste deportment,} 
\stick{which may have given grounds for a}
\natch{con-} 
\stick{contrary opinion: But it is as certain at}
\stick{the same time, that \textit{Rosinante’}s continen-}
\stick{cy (as may be demonstrated from the ad-}
\stick{venture of the \textit{Yanguesian} carriers) pro-}
\stick{ceeded from no bodily defect or cause} 
\stick{whatsoever, but from the temperance} 
\stick{and orderly current of his blood.\tsk And}
\stick{let me tell you, Madam, there is a great}
\stick{deal of very good chastity in the world,}
\stick{in behalf of which you could not say}
more for your life.

Let that be as it may, as my purpose\break
\stick{is to do exact justice to every creature}
\stick{brought upon the stage of this dramatic}
\stick{work,\tsk I could not stifle this distinction}
\stick{in favour of Don \textit{Quixote’}s horse;\tsh in}
\stick{all other points the parson’s horse, I say,}
\stick{was just such another,\tsk for he was as}
\stick{lean, and as lank, and as sorry a jade, as} 
\textscl{Humility} herself could have bestrided.
\patch{In}

In the estimation of here and there a\break
\stick{man of weak judgment, it was greatly}
\stick{in the parson’s power to have helped the}
\stick{figure of this horse of his,\tsk for he was}
\stick{master of a very handsome demi-peak’d}
\stick{saddle, quilted on the seat with green} 
\stick{plush, garnished with a double row of} 
\stick{silver-headed studs, and a noble pair of} 
\stick{shining brass stirrups, with a housing al-}
\stick{together suitable, of grey superfine cloth,}
\stick{with an edging of black lace, termina-}
\stick{ting in a deep, black, silk fringe, \textit{poudrè}}
\stick{\textit{d’or},\tsk all which he had purchased in the}
\stick{pride and prime of his life, together with} 
\stick{a grand embossed bridle, ornamented at}
\stick{all points as it should be.\tsh But not}
\stick{caring to banter his beast, he had hung}
\stick{all these up behind his study door;\tsk and,}
\stick{in lieu of them, had seriously befitted}
\stick{him with just such a bridle and such}
\natch{a} 
\stick{a saddle, as the figure and value of such}
a steed might well and truly deserve.

In the several sallies about his parish,\break 
\stick{and in the neighbouring visits to the}
\stick{gentry who lived around him,\tsh you} 
\stick{will easily comprehend, that the parson,}
\stick{so appointed, would both hear and see}
\stick{enough to keep his philosophy from}
\stick{rusting. To speak the truth, he never}
\stick{could enter a village, but he caught the}
\stick{attention of both old and young.\tsh La-}
\stick{bour stood still as he pass’d,\tsh the bucket}
\stick{hung suspended in the middle of the}
\stick{well,\tsk the spinning-wheel forgot its}
\stick{round,\tsh even chuck-farthing and}
\stick{shuffle-cap themselves stood gaping till} 
\stick{he had got out of sight; and as his}
\stick{movement was not of the quickest, he}
\stick{had generally time enough upon his}
\stick{hands to make his observations,\tsk to hear}
\natch{the} 
\stick{the groans of the serious,\tsh and the}
\stick{laughter of the light-hearted;\tsk all which}
\stick{he bore with excellent tranquillity.\tsk His} 
\stick{character was,\tsk he loved a jest in his}
\stick{heart\tsk and as he saw himself in the true}
\stick{point of ridicule, he would say, he could} 
\stick{not be angry with others for seeing him}
\stick{in a light, in which he so strongly saw} 
\stick{himself: So that to his friends, who}
\stick{knew his foible was not the love of mo-}
\stick{ney, and who therefore made the less}
\stick{scruple in bantering the extravagance of}
\stick{his humour,\tsk instead of giving the true}
\stick{cause,\tsk he chose rather to join in the} 
\stick{laugh against himself; and as he never}
\stick{carried one single ounce of flesh upon his}
\stick{own bones, being altogether as spare a} 
\stick{figure as his beast,\tsk he would sometimes}
\stick{insist upon it, that the horse was as good}
\stick{as the rider deserved;\tsk that they were,}
\stick{centaur-like,\tsk both of a piece. At other}
\natch{times,}
\stick{times, and in other moods, when his}
\stick{spirits were above the temptation of false} 
\stick{wit,\tsk he would say, he found himself}
\stick{going off fast in a consumption; and,}
\stick{with great gravity, would pretend, he}
\stick{could not bear the sight of a fat horse}
\stick{without a dejection of heart, and a sensi-}
\stick{ble alteration in his pulse; and that he}
\stick{had made choice of the lean one he rode}
\stick{upon, not only to keep himself in coun-}
tenance, but in spirits.

At different times he would give fifty\break
\stick{humorous and opposite reasons for ri-}
\stick{ding a meek-spirited jade of a broken-}
\stick{winded horse, preferably to one of met-}
\stick{tle;\tsk for on such a one he could sit me-}
\stick{chanically, and meditate as delightfully} 
\stick{\textit{de vanitate mundi et fugâ sæculi}, as with}
\stick{the advantage of a death’s head before} 
\stick{him;\tsk that, in all other exercitations, he}
\natch{could}
\stick{could spend his time, as he rode slowly}
\stick{along,\tsh to as much account as in his} 
\stick{study;\tsh that he could draw up an ar-}
\stick{gument in his sermon,\tsk or a hole in his} 
\stick{breeches, as steadily on the one as in the} 
\stick{other;\tsk that brisk trotting and slow ar-}
\stck{gumentation, like wit and judgment, were} 
\stick{two incompatible movements.\tsk But that}
\stck{upon his steed\tsk he could unite and recon-}
\stick{cile every thing,\tsk he could compose} 
\stick{his sermon,\tsk he could compose his} 
\stick{cough,\tsh and, in case nature gave a}
\stick{call that way, he could likewise compose} 
\stick{himself to sleep.\tsk In short, the parson}
\stick{upon such encounters would assign any}
\stick{cause, but the true cause,\tsk and he with-}
\stick{held the true one, only out of a nicety of}
\stick{temper, because he thought it did ho-}
nour to him.\patch{But}

But the truth of the story was as follows: In the first years of
this gentleman’s life, and about the time when the superb saddle
and bridle were purchased by him, it had been his manner, or
va\-nity, or call it what you will,\tsk to run into the opposite
extream.\tsk In the language of the county where he dwelt, he
was said to have loved a good horse, and generally had one of
the best in the whole parish standing in his stable always ready
\stick{for saddling: and as the nearest midwife,}\break
as I told you, did not
live nearer to the village than seven miles, and in a vile
country,\tsh it so fell out that the poor\break gentleman was scarce
a whole week together without some piteous application for his
beast; and as he was not an un\-kind-hearted man, and every case
was more pressing and more distressful than the last,\tsk as
much as he loved his beast,\catch{he} he had never a heart to refuse
him; the upshot of which was generally this, that his horse was
either clapp’d, or spavin’d, or greaz’d;\tsk or he was
twitter-bon’d, or broken-winded, or something, in short, or
other had befallen him which would let him carry no flesh;\tsk
so that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid
of,\tsk and a good horse to purchase in his stead.

What the loss in such a balance might \tighter{amount to, \textit{communibus
annis}, I would leave} to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffic,
to determine;\tsk but let it be what it would, the honest
gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur, till at
length, by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he found it
necessary to take the thing under consideration; and upon
weighing the whole, and summing it up\catch{in} 
\stick{in his mind, he found it not only dispro-}
\stick{portion’d to his other expences, but} 
\stick{withall so heavy an article in itself, as to} 
\stick{disable him from any other act of gene-}
\stick{rosity in his parish: Besides this, he con-}
\stick{sidered, that with half the sum thus gal-}
\stick{loped away, he could do ten times as} 
\stick{much good;\tsh and what still weighed}
\stick{more with him than all other considera-}
\stick{tions put together, was this, that it con-}
\stick{fined all his charity into one particular}
\stick{channel, and where, as he fancied, it was} 
\stick{the least wanted, namely, to the child-}
\stick{bearing and child-getting part of his}
\stick{parish; reserving nothing for the impo-}
\stick{tent,\tsk nothing for the aged,\tsk nothing}
\stick{for the many comfortless scenes he was}
\stick{hourly called forth to visit, where po-} 
\stick{verty, and sickness, and affliction dwelt}\break
together.\patch{For}

For these reasons he resolved to dis-
\stick{continue the expence; and there appear-}
\stick{ed but two possible ways to extricate} 
\stick{him clearly out of it;\tsk and these were,}
\stick{either to make it an irrevocable law ne-}
\stick{ver more to lend his steed upon any ap-}
\stick{plication whatever,\tsk or else be content} 
\stick{to ride the last poor devil, such as they}
\stick{had made him, with all his aches and in-}
firmities, to the very end of the chapter.

As he dreaded his own constancy in 
\stick{the first,\tsk he very chearfully betook} 
\stick{himself to the second; and tho’ he could} 
\stick{very well have explain’d it, as I said, to}
\stick{his honour,\tsk yet, for that very reason, he}
\stick{had a spirit above it; choosing rather to}
\stick{bear the contempt of his enemies, and} 
\stick{the laughter of his friends, than undergo}
\stick{the pain of telling a story, which might} 
seem a panegyric upon himself.\patch{I}

I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this reverend
gentleman, from this single stroke in his character, which I think comes up to any
of the honest refinements of the peerless knight of \textit{La Mancha}, whom, by the
bye, with all his follies, I love more, and would actually have gone further to have
paid a visit to, than the greatest hero of\break antiquity.

But this is not the moral of my story: The thing I had in view
was to shew the temper of the world in the whole of this
affair.\tsk For you must know, that so long as this explanation
would have done the parson credit,\tsk the devil a soul could
find it out,\tsk I suppose his enemies would not, and that his
friends could not.\tsh But no sooner did he bestir himself in
behalf of the midwife, and pay the expences of\catch{the} 
the ordinary’s licence to set her up,\tsk but\break
the whole secret came out; every horse\break
he had lost, and two horses more than\break
ever he had lost, with all the circum-\break
stances of their destruction, were known\break
and distinctly remembered.\tsk The story\break
ran like wild-fire.\tsk\lqq The parson had\break
\lqq a returning fit of pride which had just\break
\lqq seized him; and he was going to be\break
\lqq well mounted once again in his life;\break
\lqq and if it was so, ’twas plain as the sun\break
\lqq at noon-day, he would pocket the ex-\break
\lqq pence of the licence, ten times told the\break
\lqq very first year:\tsk so that every body\break
\lqq was left to judge what were his views\break
\lqq in this act of charity.”

What were his views in this, and in every other action of his
life,\tsk or rather what were the opinions which floated in the
brains of other people concerning it,\catch{was} was a thought which too much
floated in his own, and too often broke in upon his rest, when he
should have been sound asleep.

About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be
made entirely easy upon that score,\tsk it being just so long
since he left his parish,\tsk and the whole world at the same
time behind him,\tsk and stands accountable to a judge of whom he
will have no cause to complain.

But there is a fatality attends the actions of some men: Order
them as they will, they pass thro’ a certain medium, which so twists and refracts them from their true
directions\tsh that, with all the titles to praise which a
rectitude of heart can give, the doers of them are\catch{ne-} nevertheless
forced to live and die without it.

Of the truth of which, this gentleman was a painful
example.\tsh But to know by what means this came to
pass,\tsk and to make that knowledge of use to you, I~insist upon
it that you read the two following chapters, which contain such a
sketch of his life and conversation, as will carry its moral along
with it.\tsk When this is done, if nothing stops us in our way,
we will go on with the midwife.

\stick{against by the prudent care of the \textit{Yorick}’s}
\stick{family, and their religious preservation} 
\stick{of these records I quote, which do fur-}
\stick{ther inform us, That the family was ori-}
\stck{ginally of \textit{Danish} extraction, and had been}
\stick{transplanted into \textit{England} as early as in}
\stick{the reign of \textit{Horwendillus}, king of \textit{Den}-}
\stck{\textit{mark}, in whose court it seems, an ancestor} 
\stick{of this Mr.\@ \textit{Yorick}’s, and from whom he}
\stick{was lineally descended, held a consider-}
\stick{able post to the day of his death. Of what}
\stick{nature this considerable post was, this}
\stick{record saith not;\tsk it only adds, That,}
\stick{for near two centuries, it had been totally}
\natch{abo-} 
abolished as altogether unnecessary, not only in that
court, but in every other court of the Christian world.

It has often come into my head, that 
\stick{this post could be no other than that of}
the king’s chief Jester;\tsk and that
\textit{Hamlet}’s \textit{Yorick}, in our \textit{Shakespear},
many of whose plays, you know, are founded up\-on authenticated
facts,\tsk was certainly the very man.

I have not the time to look into \textit{Saxo-Grammaticus}’s
\textit{Danish} history, to know the certainty of this;\tsk but if
you have leisure, and can easily get at the book, you may do
it full as well yourself.

I had just time, in my travels through 
\stick{\textit{Denmark} with Mr.\@ \textit{Noddy}’s eldest son,}
\stick{whom, in the year 1741, I accompanied}\catch{as}
as governor, riding along with him at a
\stck{prodigious rate thro’ most parts of \textit{Europe},}
and of which original journey
perform’d by us two, a most delectable narrative will be given in
the progress of this work.\break
I had just time, I say, and that was
all, to prove the truth of an observation made by a long sojourner
in that country;\tsh\break namely, \lqq That nature was
neither very lavish, nor was she very stingy in her\break
\stick{gifts of genius and capacity to its inha-}
\stick{bitants;\tsk but, like a discreet parent, was}
moderately kind to them all; observing such an equal tenor in
the distribution of her favours, as to bring them, in those points,
pretty near to a level with each other; so that you will meet with
few instances in that kingdom of refin’d parts; but a great
deal of good plain hous\-hold understanding amongst all
ranks of\catch{people,}
\stck{people, of which every body has a share;\thinspace”}
which is, I think, very right.

With us, you see, the case is quite\break
different;\tsk we are all ups and downs in 
this matter;\tsk you are a great genius;\tsk\break 
or ’tis fifty to one, Sir, you are a great
\stick{dunce and a blockhead;\tsk not that there}
\stick{is a total want of intermediate steps,\tsk}
\stick{no,\tsk we are not so irregular as that comes}
\stick{to;\tsk but the two extremes are more}
\stick{common, and in a greater degree in this}
\stck{unsettled island, where nature, in her gifts}
\stick{and dispositions of this kind, is most} 
\stick{whimsical and capricious; fortune her-}
\stick{self not being more so in the bequest of}
her goods and chattels than she.

This is all that ever stagger’d my faith in regard to
\textit{Yorick}’s extraction, who, by what I can remember of
him, and by all\catch{the} 
the accounts I could ever get of him,\break
seem’d not to have had one single drop\break
of \textit{Danish} blood in his whole crasis; in\break
\tight{nine hundred years, it might possibly have}
\stick{all run out:\tsh I will not philosophize}
\stick{one moment with you about it; for hap-}
\stick{pen how it would, the fact was this:\tsk} 
\stick{That instead of that cold phlegm and}
\stck{exact regularity of sense and humours, you}
\stick{would have look’d for, in one so extract-}
\stick{ed;\tsk he was, on the contrary, as mer-}
\stick{curial and sublimated a composition,\tsk}
\stick{as heteroclite a creature in all his declen-}
\stick{sions;\tsk with as much life and whim,} 
\stick{and \textit{gaité de cœur} about him, as the kind-}
\stick{liest climate could have engendered and} 
\stick{put together. With all this sail, poor}
\stick{\textit{Yorick} carried not one ounce of ballast;}
\stick{he was utterly unpractised in the world;}
\stick{and, at the age of twenty-six, knew just}
\stick{about as well how to steer his course}
\natch{in} 
in it, as a romping,
unsuspicious girl of thirteen: So that upon his first setting out,
the brisk gale of his spirits, as you will imagine, ran him foul
ten times in\break 
\stick{a day of some body’s tackling; and as}
\stick{the grave and more slow-paced were} 
\stick{oftenest in his way,\tsh you may like-}
\stick{wise imagine, ’twas with such he had} 
\stick{generally the ill luck to get the most en-}
\stick{tangled. For aught I know there might}
\stick{be some mixture of unlucky wit at the} 
\stick{bottom of such \textit{Fracas:}\tsk For, to speak} 
\stick{the truth, \textit{Yorick} had an invincible dis-}
\stick{like and opposition in his nature to gra-}
\stick{vity;\tsh not to gravity as such;\tsh for}
\stick{where gravity was wanted, he would be}
\stick{the most grave or serious of mortal men} 
\stick{for days and weeks together;\tsk but he} 
\stick{was an enemy to the affectation of it,} 
\stick{and declared open war against it, only as} 
it appeared a cloak for ignorance, or for\catch{folly:\rlap{\quad\club}}
folly; and then, whenever it fell in his\break
way, however sheltered and protected,\break
he seldom gave it much quarter.

\noindent
\stick{\indent Sometimes, in his wild way of talking,}
\stick{he would say, That gravity was an errant}
scoundrel, and he would add,\tsk of the
most dangerous kind too,\tsk because a\break
\stick{sly one; and that, he verily believed,} 
\stick{more honest, well-meaning people were}
\stick{bubbled out of their goods and money}
\stick{by it in one twelve-month, than by}
\stick{pocket-picking and shop-lifting in seven.}
In the naked temper which a merry heart discovered, he would say, There was no
danger,\tsk but to itself:\tsk whereas the very essence of gravity was design, and
consequently deceit;\tsk ’twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more
sense and knowledge than a man was worth; and that, with all its pretensions,\tsk
it was\catch{no} no better, but often worse, than what a \textit{French} wit had long ago
defined it,\tsk \textit{viz. A mysterious carriage of the body to cover the defects
of the mind};\tsk which definition of gravity, \textit{Yorick}, with great
imprudence, would say, deserved to be wrote in let-\break ters of gold.

But, in plain truth, he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in
the world, and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every
other subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress
restraint. \textit{Yorick} had no impression but one, and that was
what arose from the nature of the deed spoken of; which impression
he would usually translate into plain \textit{English}
\stick{without any periphrasis,\tsk and too} 
\stick{oft without much distinction of either}
\stick{personage, time, or place;\tsk so that when}
\stick{mention was made of a pitiful or an}
\natch{un-} 
\stick{ungenerous proceeding,\tsh he never gave}
\stick{himself a moment’s time to reflect who} 
\stick{was the Hero of the piece,\tsh what his}
\stick{station,\tsh or how far he had power to}
\stick{hurt him hereafter;\tsk but if it was a dirty}
\stick{action,\tsh without more ado,\tsh The}
\stick{man was a dirty fellow,\tsk and so on:\tsk}
\stick{And as his comments had usually the ill} 
\stick{fate to be terminated either in a \textit{bon mot},} 
\stick{or to be enliven’d throughout with some} 
\stick{drollery or humour of expression, it gave} 
\stick{wings to \textit{Yorick}’s indiscretion. In a word,}
\stick{tho’ he never sought, yet, at the same}
\stick{time, as he seldom shun’d occasions of} 
\stick{saying what came uppermost, and with-}
\stick{out much ceremony;\tsk he had but too}
\stick{many temptations in life, of scattering} 
\stick{his wit and his humour,\tsk his gibes and} 
\stick{his jests about him.\tsh They were not}
lost for want of gathering.\patch{What}

What were the consequences, and\break 
what was \textit{Yorick}’s catastrophe thereup-\break
on, you will read in the next chapter.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XII.}

\dropcap{T}{he} \textit{Mortgager} and \textit{Mortgagée}\break 
differ the one from the other, not more in length
of purse, than the \textit{Jester} 
\stick{and \textit{Jestée} do, in that of memory. But}
\stick{in this the comparison between them}
runs, as the
scholiasts call it, upon all-four; which, by the bye, is upon one
or two legs more, than some of the best of \textit{Homer}’s can
pretend to;\tsk namely, That the one raises a sum and the other
a laugh at your expence, and think no more about it. Interest,
however, still runs on in both cases;\tsk the periodical or
accidental payments of it, just serving\catch{to} to keep the memory of the
affair alive; till, at length, in some evil hour,\tsk pop comes the
creditor upon each, and by demanding principal upon the spot,
together with full interest to the very day, makes them both feel
the full extent of their obligations.

As the reader (for I hate your \textit{ifs}) has a thorough
knowledge of human nature,\break I need not say more to satisfy him, that my
Hero could not go on at this rate without some
slight experience of these incidental mementos. To speak the\break
\stick{truth, he had wantonly involved himself}
\stick{in a multitude of small book-debts of}
this stamp, which, notwithstanding \textit{Eu\-genius}’s
frequent advice, he too much disregarded; thinking, that as not one
of them was contracted thro’ any malignancy;\tsk but, on
the contrary, from an\catch{honesty} honesty of mind, and a mere jocundity of
humour, they would all of them be cross’d out in course.

\textit{Eugenius} would never admit this; and would often tell
him, that one day or 
\stick{other he would certainly be reckoned}
with; and he would often add, in an accent of sorrowful apprehension,\tsk to the
uttermost mite. To which \textit{Yorick}, with\break
his usual carelessness of heart, would as\break
\stick{often answer with a pshaw!\tsk and if the} 
\stick{subject was started in the fields,\tsk with a} 
\stick{hop, skip, and a jump, at the end of it;} 
\stick{but if close pent up in the social chimney} 
corner, where the culprit was barrica\-do’d in, with a table
and a couple of arm chairs, and could not so readily fly off in a tangent,\tsk
\textit{Eugenius} would then go on with his lecture upon
discretion, in\catch{words} words to
this purpose, though somewhat better put together.

Trust me, dear \textit{Yorick}, this unwary\break pleasantry of thine
will sooner or later bring thee into scrapes and difficulties,
which no after-wit can extricate thee out of.\tsh In these
sallies, too oft, I see, it happens, that a person laugh’d at,
considers himself in the light of a person injured, with all the
rights of such a situa\-tion belonging to him; and when thou viewest
him in that light too, and rec\-kons up his friends, his family, his
kindred and allies,\tsk and musters up with them the many
recruits which will list under him from a sense of common
danger;\tsk ’tis no extravagant arithmetic to
\stick{say, that for every ten jokes,\tsk thou hast}
got a hundred enemies; and till
thou hast gone on, and raised a swarm of wasps\catch{about} about thine ears,
and art half stung to death by them, thou wilt never be
convinced it is so.

I cannot suspect it in the man whom I esteem, that there is the
least spur from spleen or malevolence of intent in these
sallies.\tsh I believe and know them to\break be truly honest and
sportive:\tsk But consider, my dear lad, that fools cannot
di\-stinguish this,\tsk and that knaves will not; and thou knowest
not what it is, either to provoke the one, or to make merry 
\stick{with the other,\tsk whenever they associate}
\stick{for mutual defence, depend upon it, they}
\stick{will carry on the war in such a manner} 
\stick{against thee, my dear friend, as to make} 
thee heartily sick of it, and of thy life too.

\textscl{Revenge} from some baneful corner shall level a tale of dishonour at
thee,\catch{which}
\stick{which no innocence of heart or integrity} 
\stick{of conduct shall set right.\tsh The for-}
\stick{tunes of thy house shall totter,\tsk thy cha-}
\stick{racter, which led the way to them, shall}
\stick{bleed on every side of it,\tsk thy faith que-}
\stick{stioned,\tsk thy works belied,\tsk thy wit}
\stick{forgotten,\tsk thy learning trampled on.} 
\stick{To wind up the last scene of thy tragedy,}
\stick{\textscl{Cruelty} and \textscl{Cowardice}, twin ruf-}
\stick{fians, hired and set on by \textscl{Malice} in the}
\stick{dark, shall strike together at all thy in-}
\stick{firmities and mistakes:\tsh the best of us,}
\stick{my dear lad, lye open there,\tsk and trust} 
me,\tsk trust me, \textit{Yorick}, \textit{When to gratify\break
a private appetite, it is once resolved up-\break
on, that an innocent and an helpless creature\break
shall be sacrificed, ’tis an easy matter to pick\break
up sticks enew from any thicket where it has\break
strayed, to make a fire to offer it up with.}\patch{\textit{Yorick}}

\textit{Yorick} scarce ever heard this sad va\-ticination of his
destiny read over to him, but with a tear stealing from his eye,
and a promissory look attending it, that he was resolved, for the
time to come, to ride his tit with more sobriety.\tsh But,
\stick{alas, too late!\tsk a grand confederacy,}
with \astv\ and \astv\ at the 
head of it, was form’d before the first prediction of it.\tsk The
whole plan of the attack, just as \textit{Eugenius} had foreboded,
was put in execution all at once,\tsk with so little mercy on the side of the allies,\tsk and so little
suspicion in \textit{Yorick}, of what was carrying on against
him,\tsk that when he thought, good easy man! full surely
preferment was o’ripening,\tsk they had smote his root, and
then he fell, as many a worthy man had fallen before him.\patch{\textit{Yorick},}

\textit{Yorick}, however, fought it out with all
\stick{imaginable gallantry for some time; till,} 
\stick{over-power’d by numbers, and worn} 
\stick{out at length by the calamities of the} 
\stick{war,\tsk but more so, by the ungenerous}
\stick{manner in which it was carried on,\tsk he}
\stick{threw down the sword; and though he} 
\stick{kept up his spirits in appearance to the}
\stick{last,\tsk he died, nevertheless, as was gene-}
rally thought, quite broken hearted.

What inclined \textit{Eugenius} to the same opinion, was as
follows:

A few hours before \textit{Yorick} breath’d\break
\stick{his last, \textit{Eugenius} stept in with an intent}
\stick{to take his last sight and last farewell of} 
\stick{him: Upon his drawing \textit{Yorick}’s cur-}
\stick{tain, and asking how he felt himself,}
\stick{\textit{Yorick}, looking up in his face, took hold}
\stick{of his hand,\tsk and, after thanking him}
\natch{for}
\stick{for the many tokens of his friendship to} 
\stick{him, for which, he said, if it was their}
\stick{fate to meet hereafter,\tsk he would thank}
\stick{him again and again.\tsk He told him, he} 
\stick{was within a few hours of giving his} 
\stick{enemies the slip for ever.\tsk I hope not,}
\stick{answered \textit{Eugenius}, with tears trickling}
\stick{down his cheeks, and with the tenderest}
\stick{tone that ever man spoke.\tsk I hope not,}
\stick{\textit{Yorick}, said he.\tsk \textit{Yorick} replied, with a} 
\stick{look up, and a gentle squeeze of \textit{Eu-}}
\stick{\textit{genius}’s hand, and that was all,\tsk but it}
\stick{cut \textit{Eugenius} to his heart.\tsk Come,\tsk}
\stick{come, \textit{Yorick}, quoth \textit{Eugenius}, wiping} 
\stick{his eyes, and summoning up the man}
\stick{within him,\tsk my dear lad, be comfort-}
\stick{ed,\tsk let not all thy spirits and fortitude}
\stick{forsake thee at this crisis when thou most} 
\stick{wants them;\tsh who knows what re-}
\stick{sources are in store, and what the power}
\stick{of God may yet do for thee?\tsh \textit{Yorick}}
\natch{laid}
\stick{laid his hand upon his heart, and gently}
shook his head;\tsk for my part, continued \textit{Eugenius},
crying bitterly as he uttered the words,\tsk I declare I know not,
\textit{Yorick}, how to part with thee,\tsh and\break 
would gladly flatter my hopes, added\break
\textit{Eugenius}, chearing up his voice, that\break
there is still enough left of thee to make\break
a bishop,\tsk and that I may live to see\break 
it.\tsk I beseech thee, \textit{Eugenius}, quoth\break
\textit{Yorick}, taking off his night-cap as well as he
could with his left hand,\tsk his\break right being still grasped close in that of
\stick{\textit{Eugenius},\tsk I beseech thee to take a}
\stick{view of my head.\tsk I see nothing that}
\stick{ails it, replied \textit{Eugenius.} Then, alas!}
\stick{my friend, said \textit{Yorick}, let me tell you,}
\stck{that ’tis so bruised and mis-shapen’d with}
\stick{the blows which \astv\ and \astv,}
\stick{and some others have so unhandsomely}
\stick{given me in the dark, that I might say}\catch{with} 
with \textit{Sancho Pança}, that should I reco-\break 
\stick{ver, and \lqq Mitres thereupon be suffer’d}
\stick{\lqq to rain down from heaven as thick as}
\stick{\lqq hail, not one of ’em would fit it.\,”\tsh}
\textit{Yorick}’s last breath was hanging upon\break his
trembling lips ready to depart as he uttered this;\tsh yet still it
was utter’d with something of a \textit{cervantick} tone;\tsh\break and as he
spoke it, \textit{Eugenius} could perceive a stream of lambent fire lighted up
\stick{for a moment in his eyes;\tsk faint picture} of those flashes of his
spirit, which (as \stck{\textit{Shakespear} said of
his ancestor) were wont} to set the
table in a roar!

\textit{Eugenius} was convinced from this,\break
that the heart of his friend was broke;\break
he squeez’d his hand,\tsh and then\break
walk’d softly out of the room, weeping as he walk’d. \textit{Yorick}
\stick{followed \textit{Eugenius} with his eyes to the door,\tsk he then}
\natch{closed}
closed them,\tsk and never opened them more.

He lies buried in the corner of his church-yard, in the parish of
\tsh,\break under a plain marble slabb, which his friend
\textit{Eugenius}, by leave of his executors, laid upon his grave, with no more
than these three words of inscription serving both for his epitaph and
elegy.

\dropcap{I}{t} is so long since the reader of
this rhapsodical work has been parted\break from the midwife, that it is
high time to mention her again to him, merely to put him in mind
that there is such a body still in the world, and whom, upon the
best judgment I can form upon my own plan at present,\tsk I am going to
introduce to him for good and all: But as fresh matter may be
started, and much unexpected business fall out betwixt the reader
and myself, which may require immediate
dispatch;\tsh ’twas right to take care that the poor
woman should not be lost in the mean time;\tsk because when she
is wanted, we can no way do without her.\patch{I}

I think I told you that this good wo\-man was a person of no small
note and consequence throughout our whole village and
township;\tsk that her fame had spread itself to the very
out-edge and circumference of that circle of importance, of which
kind every soul living, whether he has a shirt to his back or no,\tsh has
one surrounding him;\tsk which said circle,\break
by the way, whenever ’tis said that such
a one is of great weight and importance
in the \textit{world},\tsh I desire may be enlar\-ged or
contracted in your worship’s fan\-cy, in a compound-ratio of
the station, profession, knowledge, abilities, height and depth
(measuring both ways) of the personage brought before you.

In the present case, if I remember, I fixed it about four or
five miles, which not only comprehended the whole pa-\catch{rish,} 
rish, but extended itself to two or three\break
of the adjacent hamlets in the skirts of 
the next parish; which made a consider\-able
thing of it. I must add, That she
was, moreover, very well looked on at
one large grange-house and some other 
odd houses and farms within two or
three miles, as I said, from the smoke of 
her own chimney:\tsh But I must here, 
once for all, inform you, that all this will
be more exactly delineated and explain’d
in a map, now in the hands of the en\-graver, 
which, with many other pieces 
and developements of this work, will be
added to the end of the twentieth vo\-lume,
\tsk not to swell the work,\tsk I detest
the thought of such a thing;\tsk but by 
way of commentary, scholium, illustra\-tion, 
and key to such passages, incidents, 
or innuendos as shall be thought to be ei\-ther of
private interpretation, or of dark\catch{or} 
\stick{or doubtful meaning after my life and}
\stick{my opinions shall have been read over,} 
\stick{(now don’t forget the meaning of the}

But in order to put a stop to the practice of any unfair play on
the part of my mother, which a marriage article of this\catch{nature}
\stick{nature too manifestly opened a door to,} 
\stck{and which indeed had never been thought}
of at all, but for my uncle \textit{Toby Shandy};\tsk\break 
a clause was added in security of my fa-\break
ther which was this:\tsk \lqq That in case my\break
\lqq mother hereafter should, at any time,\break
\lqq put my father to the trouble and ex-\break
\lqq pence of a \textit{London} journey upon false\break

\lqq her to the next turn;\tsh but to no\break
\lqq more,\tsk and so on, \textit{toties quoties}, in as\break
\lqq effectual a manner, as if such a co-\break
\lqq venant betwixt them had not been\break
\lqq made.”\tsk This, by the way, was no\break
more than what was reasonable;\tsk
and yet, as reasonable as
it was, I have ever thought it hard that the whole weight of the
article should have fallen entirely, as\break
it did, upon myself.\\
\rightline{But}
\newpage

But I was begot and born to misfortunes;\tsk 
for my poor mother, whether\break
it was wind or water,\tsk or a compound\break
of both,\tsk or neither;\tsk or whether it\break
was simply the mere swell of imagination\break
and fancy in her;\tsk or how far a strong\break
wish and desire to have it so, might mis-\break
lead her judgment;\tsk in short, whether\break
she was deceived or deceiving in this\break
matter, it no way becomes me to decide.\break 
\stick{The fact was this, That, in the latter end} 
\stick{of \textit{September}, 1717, which was the year} 
\stick{before I was born, my mother having}
\stick{carried my father up to town much} 
\stick{against the grain,\tsk he peremptorily in-}
\stick{sisted upon the clause;\tsk so that I was}
\stick{doom’d, by marriage articles, to have} 
\stick{my nose squeez’d as flat to my face, as if} 
\stick{the destinies had actually spun me with-}
out one.\patch{How}

How this event came about,\tsk and what a train of vexatious
disappoint-\break ments, in one stage or other of my life, have pursued me
from the mere loss, or rather compression, of this one single
member,\tsk shall be laid before the rea-\break der all in due time.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XVI.}

\dropcap{M}{y} father, as any body may naturally imagine, came down with\break
\stick{my mother into the country, in but a} 
\stick{pettish kind of a humour. The first}
\stick{twenty or five-and-twenty miles he did}
\stick{nothing in the world but fret and teaze}
\stck{himself, and indeed my mother too, about}
\stick{the cursed expence, which he said might}
\stick{every shilling of it have been saved;\tsk}
\stick{then what vexed him more than every}\catch{thing} thing else was, the provoking time of the
\stick{year,\tsh which, as I told you, was to-} wards the end of
\textit{September}, when his wall-fruit, and green gages especially, in which he was
very curious, were just ready for pulling:\tsh \lqq Had he been\break
\lqq whistled up to \textit{London}, upon a \textit{Tom}\break
\lqq \textit{Fool}’s errand, in any other month of\break
\lqq the whole year, he should not have\break
\lqq said three words about it.\,”

For the next two whole stages, no\break
subject would go down, but the heavy blow he
had sustain’d from the loss of a son, whom it seems he had fully
reckon’d upon in his mind, and register’d down in his pocket-book,
as a second staff for\break
\stick{his old age, in case \textit{Bobby} should fail him.}
\stick{\lqq The disappointment of this, he said,}
\stick{\lqq was ten times more to a wise man than}
\stick{\lqq all the money which the journey, \et\textit{c}.}\catch{\lqq had}
\stick{\lqq had cost him, put together,\tsk rot the}
\stick{\lqq hundred and twenty pounds,\tsh he}
\stick{\lqq did not mind it a rush.\,”\hfill}

From \textit{Stilton}, all the way to \textit{Grantham}, nothing in
the whole affair provoked\break him so much as the condolences of his
\stck{friends, and the foolish figure they should}
both make at church,
the first \textit{Sunday};\break\tsk of which, in the satirical
vehemence of his wit, now sharpen’d a little by vexation, he
would give so many humorous and provoking descriptions,\tsk and
place his rib and self in so many tormenting lights and attitudes
in the face of the whole congregation;\tsk that my mother
declared, these two stages were so truly tragi-comical, that she
did nothing but laugh and cry in a breath, from one end to the
other of them all the way.\patch{From}

From \textit{Grantham}, till they had cross’d the
\textit{Trent}, my father was out of all kind of patience at the vile
trick and imposition which he fancied my mother had put upon him in
this affair.\tsk \lqq Certainly,\break 
\stick{he would say to himself, over and over} 
\stick{again, \lqq the woman could not be decei-}
\stick{ved herself;\tsh if she could,\tsh} 
\stick{what weakness!\tsk tormenting word!}
\stick{which led his imagination a thorny}
\stick{dance, and, before all was over, play’d}
\stick{the duce and all with him;”\tsh for}
sure as ever the word \textit{weakness} was uttered, and
struck full upon his brain,\tsh\break
so sure it set him upon running divisions upon how
many kinds of weaknesses there were;\tsh that there was\break 
such a thing as weakness of the body,\break
\tsh as well as weakness of the mind,\tsk\break
and then he would do nothing but syl\-logize within himself for a stage or
two\catch{to-}
together, How far the cause of all these\break
vexations might, or might not, have\break
arisen out of himself.

In short, he had so many little subjects
\stick{of disquietude springing out of this one}
\stick{affair, all fretting successively in his}
\stick{mind as they rose up in it, that my mo-}
\stick{ther, whatever was her journey up, had} 
\stick{but an uneasy journey of it down.\tsh}
\stick{In a word, as she complained to my un-}
\stick{cle \textit{Toby}, he would have tired out the}
patience of any flesh alive.

\initial[findent=1.4pt]{T}{Hough} my father travelled home-\break
wards, as I told you, in none of\break
the best of moods,\tsk pshaw-ing and

My father was a gentleman of many virtues,\tsk but he had a
strong spice of that in his temper, which might, or might not, add
to the number.\tsk ’Tis known by the name of perseverance
in a good cause,\tsk and of obstinacy in a bad one: Of this my
mother had so much know\-ledge, that she knew ’twas to no
purpose to make any remonstrance,\tsk so she e’en resolved
to sit down quietly, and\break make the most of it.

\null
\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XVIII.}

\dropcap[findent=0pt]{A}{s} the point was that night agreed,\break or rather
determin’d, that my mo\-ther should lye-in of me in the country, she
took her measures accordingly; for which purpose, when she was
three days, or thereabouts, gone with child, she be-\catch{gan}
\stick{gan to cast her eyes upon the midwife,}
whom you have so often heard me mention; and
before the week was well got 
\tight{round, as the famous Dr.\@ \textit{Manningham} was}
not to be had, she had come to a final
determination in her mind,\tsh notwith\-standing there was a scientifick \hbox{operator} 
\stick{within so near a call as eight miles of us,}
\stick{and who, moreover, had expressly wrote}
\stick{a five shillings book upon the subject of}
\stick{midwifery, in which he had exposed,}
\stick{not only the blunders of the sisterhood}
\stick{itself,\tsh but had likewise superadded}
\stick{many curious improvements for the}
\stick{quicker extraction of the fœtus in cross}
\stick{births, and some other cases of danger}
\stick{which belay us in getting into the world;} 
\stick{notwithstanding all this, my mother, I}
\tight{say, was absolutely determined to trust her}
\stick{life and mine with it, into no soul’s hand}
\stick{but this old woman’s only.\tsk Now this I}\catch{like;}
\stick{like;\tsk when we cannot get at the very}
\stick{thing we wish\tsh never to take up}
\stick{with the next best in degree to it:\tsk no;} 
\stick{that’s pitiful beyond description;\tsk it is}
\stick{no more than a week from this very day,} 
\stick{in which I am now writing this book for}
\stick{the edification of the world;\tsk which is}
\stick{\textit{March} 9, 1759,\tsh that my dear, dear}
\stick{\textit{Jenny} observing I look’d a little grave,}
\stck{as she stood cheapening a silk of five-and-}
\stick{twenty shillings a yard,\tsk told the mer-}
\stick{cer, she was sorry she had given him so}
\stick{much trouble;\tsk and immediately went}
\stick{and bought herself a yard-wide stuff of} 
\stick{ten-pence a yard.\tsk ’Tis the duplication}
\stick{of one and the same greatness of soul;}
\stck{only what lessen’d the honour of it, some-}
\stick{what, in my mother’s case, was, that she}
\stick{could not heroine it into so violent and}
\stick{hazardous an extream, as one in her} 
\stick{situation might have wish’d, because the}\catch{old}
\stick{old midwife had really some little claim} 
\stick{to be depended upon,\tsk as much, at least,}
\stick{as success could give her; having, in the} 
\stick{course of her practice of near twenty} 
\stick{years in the parish, brought every mo-}
\stick{ther’s son of them into the world with-}
\stick{out any one slip or accident which could} 
fairly be laid to her account.

\tight{These facts, tho’ they had their weight,}
yet did not
altogether satisfy some few scruples and uneasinesses which hung
upon my father’s spirits in relation to this choice.\tsk To
say nothing of the natural workings of humanity and
justice,\tsk or of the yearnings of parental and connubial love,
all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in a case of this
kind;\tsh he felt himself concern’d in a particular
manner, that all should go right in the present case;\tsk from
the\catch{ac-}
\stick{accumulated sorrow he lay open to,}
should any evil betide his
wife and child in lying-in at \textit{Shandy-Hall}.\tsh He
knew the world judged by events, and would add to his afflictions
in such a misfortune, by loading him with the whole blame of
it.\tsh \lqq Alas o’day;\tsk had Mrs.\@ \textit{Shandy},\break
\lqq poor gentlewoman! had but her wish\break
\lqq in going up to town just to lye-in and\break
\lqq come down again;\tsk which, they say,\break
\lqq she begg’d and pray’d for upon her\break
\lqq bare knees,\tsh and which, in my opi-\break
\lqq nion, considering the fortune which\break
\lqq Mr.\@ \textit{Shandy} got with her,\tsk was no such\break
\lqq mighty matter to have complied with,\break
\lqq the lady and her babe might both of\break
\lqq ’em have been alive at this hour.”

This exclamation, my father knew\break was unanswerable;\tsk and
yet, it was not merely to shelter himself,\tsk nor was\catch{it} it
altogether for the care of his offspring and wife that he seem’d so
extremely anxious about this point;\tsk my father had extensive
views of things,\tsh and stood, moreover, as he thought,
deeply concern’d in it for the publick good,\break 
from the dread he entertained of the\break
bad uses an ill-fated instance might be\break
put to.

\noindent
\stick{\hfill He was very sensible that all political}
\stck{writers upon the subject had unanimously} 
\stick{agreed and lamented, from the begin-}
\stick{ning of Queen \textit{Elizabeth}’s reign down} 
\stick{to his own time, that the current of men} 
\stick{and money towards the metropolis, up-}
\stick{on one frivolous errand or another,\tsk}
\stick{set in so strong,\tsk as to become dange-}
\stick{rous to our civil rights,\tsk tho’, by the}
\stick{bye,\tsh a \textit{current} was not the image he}
\stick{took most delight in,\tsk a \textit{distemper} was}\catch{here}
\stick{here his favourite metaphor, and he}
\stick{would run it down into a perfect allego-}
\stick{ry, by maintaining it was identically the}
\stick{same in the body national as in the body}
\stick{natural, where blood and spirits were}
\stick{driven up into the head faster than they}
\stick{could find their ways down;\tsh a stop-}
\stick{page of circulation must ensue, which}
was death in both cases.

There was little danger, he would say, of losing our liberties
by \textit{French} politicks or \textit{French}
invasions;\tsh nor was he so much in pain of a consumption
from the mass of corrupted matter and ulce\-rated humours in our
constitution,\tsh\break which he hoped was not so bad as it was
imagined;\tsk but he verily feared, that in some violent push, we
should go off, all at once, in a state-apoplexy;\tsk and\catch{then} then he
would say, \textit{The Lord have mercy upon us all}.

My father was never able to give the history of this
distemper,\tsk without the remedy along with it.

\indent\lqq Was I an absolute prince, he would\break
say, pulling up his breeches with both\break
his hands, as he rose from his arm-chair,\break
\lqq I would appoint able judges, at every\break
\lqq avenue of my metropolis, who should\break
\lqq take cognizance of every fool’s busi-\break
\lqq ness who came there;\tsk and if, upon\break
\lqq a fair and candid hearing, it appeared\break
\lqq not of weight sufficient to leave his\break
\lqq own home, and come up, bag and\break
\lqq baggage, with his wife and children,\break
\lqq farmers sons, \etc \etc at his backside,\break
\lqq they should be all sent back, from\break
\lqq constable to constable, like vagrants\catch{\lqq as} 
\lqq as they were, to the place of their le-\break
\lqq gal settlements. By this means I shall\break
\lqq take care, that my metropolis totter’d\break
\lqq not thro’ its own weight;\tsk that the\break
\lqq head be no longer too big for the bo-\break
\lqq dy;\tsk that the extreams, now wasted\break
\lqq and pin’d in, be restored to their due\break
\lqq share of nourishment, and regain, with\break
\lqq it, their natural strength and beauty:\tsk\break
\lqq I would effectually provide, That the\break
\lqq meadows and corn-fields, of my do-\break
\lqq minions, should laugh and sing;\tsh\break
\lqq that good chear and hospitality flou-\break
\lqq rish once more;\tsk and that such weight\break
\lqq and influence be put thereby into the\break
\lqq hands of the Squirality of my king-\break
\lqq dom, as should counterpoise what I\break
\lqq perceive my Nobility are now taking\break
\lqq from them.\\
\rightline{\lqq Why}
\newpage
\indent\lqq Why are there so few palaces and\break
\lqq gentlemen’s seats, he would ask, with\break
\stick{some emotion, as he walked a-cross the}\break
room, \lqq throughout so many delicious\break
\lqq provinces in \textit{France?} Whence is it that\break
\lqq the few remaining \textit{Chateaus} amongst\break
\lqq them are so dismantled,\tsk so unfurnish-\break
\lqq ed, and in so ruinous and desolate a\break
\lqq condition?\tsh Because, Sir, (he would\break
say) \lqq in that kingdom no man has any\break
\lqq country-interest to support;\tsk the little\break
\lqq interest of any kind, which any man\break
\lqq has any where in it, is concentrated in\break
\lqq the court, and the looks of the Grand\break
\lqq Monarch; by the sun-shine of whose\break
\lqq countenance, or the clouds which pass\break
\lqq a-cross it, every \textit{French} man lives or\break
\lqq dies.\,”

\noindent
\stick{\hfil \tight{Another political reason which prompt-}}
\stick{ed my father so strongly to guard against}\catch{the}
the least evil accident in my mother’s lying-in in the
country,\tsh was, That any such instance would infallibly throw
a balance of power, too great already,\break into the weaker
vessels of the gentry, in his own, or higher stations;\tsh
which, with the many other usurped rights\break which that part
of the constitution was hourly establishing,\tsk would, in the
end, prove fatal to the monarchical system of domestick
government established in the\break first creation of things by
God.

In this point he was entirely of Sir \textit{Robert Filmer}’s
opinion, That the plans and institutions of the greatest
monarchies in the eastern parts of the world, were, originally,
all stolen from that admirable pattern and prototype of
this\break houshold and paternal power;\tsk which, for a
century, he said, and more, had\catch{gra-}
\stick{gradually been degenerating away into}
\stick{a mix’d government;\tsh the form of} 
\stick{which, however desirable in great com-}
\stick{binations of the species,\tsh was very}
\stick{troublesome in small ones,\tsk and seldom}
\stick{produced any thing, that he saw, but} 
sorrow and confusion.


For all these reasons, private and pub\-lick, put together,\tsk
my father was for having the man-midwife by all means,\tsk
my mother by no means. My father\break begg’d and intreated, she
would for once recede from her prerogative in this matter, and
suffer him to choose for her;\tsk my mother, on the
contrary, insisted up\-on her privilege in this matter, to
choose for herself,\tsk and have no mortal’s help but the old
woman’s.\tsk What could my father do? He was almost at his
wit’s end;\tsh talked it over with her in all\catch{moods;}
moods;\tsk placed his arguments in all lights;\tsk argued the
matter with her like a christian,\tsk like a heathen,\tsk like
a husband,\tsk like a father,\tsk like a patriot,\tsk like a
man:\tsk My mother answered every thing only like a woman;
which was a little hard upon her;\tsk for as she could not
assume and fight it out behind such a variety of
characters,\tsk\break ’twas no fair match:\tsk ’twas seven to
one.\tsk What could my mother do?\tsk\break She had the
advantage (otherwise she had been certainly overpowered) of
a\break small reinforcement of chagrine personal at the bottom
which bore her up, and enabled her to dispute the affair with my
father with so equal an advantage,\tsh\break that both sides
sung \textit{Te Deum}. In a\break word, my mother was to have
the old woman,\tsk and the operator was to have licence to
drink a bottle of wine with\catch{my} my father and my uncle
\textit{Toby Shandy} in the back parlour,\tsk for which he was
to be paid five guineas.

I must beg leave, before I finish this chapter, to enter a
caveat in the breast of my fair reader;\tsk and it is
this:\tsh\break Not to take it absolutely for granted\break from an
unguarded word or two which I have dropp’d in
it,\tsh\lqq That I am a married
man.”\tsk I own the tender appel\-lation of my dear, dear
\textit{Jenny},\tsk with\break some other strokes of conjugal know\-ledge,
interspersed here and there, might, naturally enough, have misled
the most candid judge in the world into such a determination
against me.\tsk All I plead for, in this case, Madam, is strict
justice, and that you do so much of it, to me as well as to
yourself,\tsk as not to prejudge,\break or receive such an impression
of me, till\catch{you}
\stick{you have better evidence, than I am}
\stick{positive, at present, can be produced}
\stick{against me:\tsk Not that I can be so vain}
\stick{or unreasonable, Madam, as to desire}
\stick{you should therefore think, that my dear,}
\stick{dear \textit{Jenny} is my kept mistress;\tsk no,\tsk}
\stick{that would be flattering my character in}
the other
extream, and giving it an air of freedom, which, perhaps, it has no
kind of right to. All I contend for, is the utter impossibility
for some volumes, 
\stick{that you, or the most penetrating spirit} 
\stick{upon earth, should know how this mat-}
\stick{ter really stands.\tsk It is not impossible,}
\stick{but that my dear, dear \textit{Jenny!} tender as}
\stick{the appellation is, may be my child.\tsk}
\stick{Consider,\tsk I was born in the year eigh-}
\stick{teen.\tsk Nor is there any thing unnatural}
\stick{or extravagant in the supposition, that}
\stick{my dear \textit{Jenny} may be my friend.\tsk}
\stick{Friend!\tsk My friend.\tsk Surely, Madam,}\catch{a}
\stick{a friendship between the two sexes may}
\stick{subsist, and be supported without\tsh}
Fy! Mr.\@ \textit{Shandy:}\tsk Without
any thing, Madam, but that tender and delicious\break
sentiment, which ever mixes in friend\-ship, where there is a difference of sex.\break
Let me intreat you to study the pure\break
and sentimental parts of the best \textit{French}\break 
Romances;\tsh it will really, Madam,\break
astonish you to see with what a variety of chaste expressions
this delicious sentiment, which I have the honour to speak of,
is dress’d out.

\initial{I}{Would} sooner undertake to explain
the hardest problem in Geometry,\break
than pretend to account for it, that a\break
gentleman of my father’s great good\catch{sense,}
sense,\tsh knowing, as the reader must have observed him,
and curious too, in philosophy,\tsk wise also in political
reasoning,\tsk and in polemical (as he will find) no way
ignorant,\tsk could be capable of entertaining a notion in his
head, so out of the common track,\tsk that I fear the reader,
when I come to mention it to him, if he is the least of a cholerick
temper, will immediatly throw the book by;\break if mercurial, he will laugh most
heartily at it;\tsk and if he is of a grave and sa\-turnine cast, he will, at first
sight, abso\-lutely condemn as fanciful and extrava\-gant; and that was in respect
to the\break\stck{choice and imposition of Christian names,} on which he thought a
great deal more depended than what superficial minds were capable of
conceiving.\patch{His}

His opinion, in this matter, was, That
\stick{there was a strange kind of magick bias,}
\stick{which good or bad names, as he called} 
\stck{them, irresistibly impress’d upon our cha-}
racters and conduct.

The Hero of \textit{Cervantes} argued not the point with more
seriousness,\tsk nor had\break 
he more faith,\tsh or more to say on the\break
powers of Necromancy in dishonouring his
deeds,\tsk or on \textscl{Dulcinea}’s name, in
shedding lustre upon them, than my father had on those of
\textscl{Trismegistus} or \textsc{Archimedes}, on the
one hand,\tsk or of \textscl{Nyky} and \textsc{Simkin}
on the other. How many \textscl{Cæsars} and
\textscl{Pompeys}, he would say, by mere inspiration of the
names, have been render’d worthy of them?\break And how many, he would
add, are there who might have done exceeding well in the world,
had not their characters and\catch{spirits} 
spirits been totally depress’d and \textscl{Nico\-demus’d} into
nothing.

I see plainly, Sir, by your looks, (or as the case happen’d) my
father would say\tsk that you do not heartily subscribe to this
opinion of mine,\tsk which, to those, he would add, who have not
carefully sifted it to the bottom,\tsk I own has an air more of
fancy than of solid reasoning in it;\tsh and yet, my dear
Sir, if I may presume to know your character, I am morally assured,
I should hazard little in stating a case to you,\tsk not as a party in
the dispute,\tsk but as a judge, and trusting my appeal upon it
to your own good sense and candid disquisition in this
matter;\tsh you are a person free from as many narrow
prejudices of education as most men;\tsk and, if I may presume to
penetrate further into you,\tsk of a libe-\catch{rality} 
\stick{rality of genius above bearing down an} 
\stick{opinion, merely because it wants friends.}
\stick{Your son!\tsk your dear son,\tsk from whose} 
\stck{sweet and open temper you have so much}
\stick{to expect.\tsk Your \textscl{Billy}, Sir!\tsk would}
\stick{you, for the world, have called him}
\stick{\textscl{Judas}?\tsk Would you, my dear Sir, he}
\stick{would say, laying his hand upon your} 
\stick{breast, with the genteelest address,\tsk and}
\stick{in that soft and irresistible \textit{piano} of voice,} 
\stick{which the nature of the \textit{argumentum ad}}
\stick{\textit{hominem} absolutely requires,\tsk Would}
\stick{you, Sir, if a \textit{Jew} of a godfather had}
\stick{proposed the name for your child, and}
\stick{offered you his purse along with it, would} 
\stick{you have consented to such a desecration}
\stick{of him?\tsh O my God! he would say,} 
\stick{looking up, if I know your temper right,}
\stick{Sir,\tsk you are incapable of it;\tsh you}
\stick{would have trampled upon the offer;\tsk}
\natch{you} you
would have thrown the temptation at the tempter’s head with
abhorrence.

Your greatness of mind in this action, which I admire, with that
generous contempt of money, which you shew me in the whole
transaction, is really noble;\tsk\break and what renders it more so, is
the principle of it;\tsk the workings of a parent’s\break
love upon the truth and conviction of\break
this very hypothesis, namely, That
was your son called \textscl{Judas},\tsk the sordid and
treacherous idea, so inseparable from the name, would have
accompanied him\break
thro’ life like his shadow, and, in the\break
end, made a miser and a rascal of him,\break 
in spight, Sir, of your example.

I never knew a man able to answer this argument.\tsk But, indeed, to speak of
my father as he was;\tsk he was cer-\catch{tainly}
\stck{tainly irresistible, both in his orations and}
\stick{disputations;\tsk he was born an orator;\tsk}
{\small Θεοδίδακτος}.\tsk Persuasion hung upon his lips, and the
elements of Logick and\break
Rhetorick were so blended up in him,\tsk\break
and, withall,
he had so shrewd guess at the weaknesses and passions of his
respondent,\tsh that \textsc{Nature} might have stood up and
said,\tsk \lqq This man is eloquent.\,” In short, whether he was
on the weak or the strong side of the que\-stion, ’twas hazardous in either
case to attack him:\tsk And yet, ’tis strange, he\break
had never read
\textit{Cicero}, nor \textit{Quintilian de Oratore}, nor \textit{Isocrates}, nor
\textit{Aristotle}, nor \textit{Longinus}, amongst the antients;\tsk nor
\textit{Vossius}, nor \textit{Skioppius}, nor \textit{Ramus},
nor\break
\textit{Farnaby}, amongst the moderns;\tsk and\break
what is more astonishing, he had never in\break
his whole life the least light or spark of\break
\tight{subtilty struck into his mind, by one
single}\catch{lecture} 
lecture upon \textit{Crackenthorp} or \textit{Burgersdicius} or any
\textit{Dutch} logician or commentator;\tsk he knew not so much as in what the
difference of an argument \textit{ad igno\-rantiam}, and an argument \textit{ad
hominem}\break
\stick{consisted; so that I well remember, when}
\stick{he went up along with me to enter my} 
\stick{name at \textit{Jesus College} in \astiv,\tsk it was}
\stick{a matter of just wonder with my worthy} 
\stick{tutor, and two or three fellows of that} 
\stick{learned society,\tsk that a man who knew}
\stick{not so much as the names of his tools,}
\stick{should be able to work after that fashion}
with ’em.

To work with them in the best manner he could, was what my
father was, however, perpetually forced upon;\tsh\break 
\stick{for he had a thousand little sceptical no-}
\stick{tions of the comick kind to defend,\tsh}
\stick{most of which notions, I verily believe,}
\natch{at} at
first enter’d upon the footing of mere whims, and of a \textit{vive la
Bagatelle}; and as such he would make merry with them for half
an hour or so, and having sharpen’d his wit upon ’em, dismiss them
till another day.

I mention this, not only as matter of 
\stick{hypothesis or conjecture upon the pro-}
\stick{gress and establishment of my father’s} 
\stick{many odd opinions,\tsk but as a warning to} 
\stick{the learned reader against the indiscreet} 
\stick{reception of such guests, who, after a}
\stick{free and undisturbed entrance, for some} 
\stick{years, into our brains,\tsk at length claim} 
\stick{a kind of settlement there,\tsh working}
\stick{sometimes like yeast;\tsk but more gene-}
\stick{rally after the manner of the gentle pas-}
\stick{sion, beginning in jest,\tsk but ending in}
downright earnest.\patch{Whether}

Whether this was the case of the sin-
\stick{gularity of my father’s notions\tsk or that}
\stick{his judgment, at length, became the} 
\stick{dupe of his wit;\tsk or how far, in many} 
\stick{of his notions, he might, tho’ odd, be}
\stick{absolutely right;\tsk the reader, as he}
\stick{comes at them, shall decide. All that}
\stick{I maintain here, is, that in this one, of}
\stick{the influence of Christian names, how-}
\stick{ever it gain’d footing, he was serious;\tsk} 
\stick{he was all uniformity;\tsk he was systema-}
\stick{tical, and, like all systematick reasoners,} 
\stick{he would move both heaven and earth,} 
\stick{and twist and torture every thing in na-}
\stick{ture to support his hypothesis. In a}
\stick{word, I repeat it over again;\tsk he was}
\stick{serious;\tsk and, in consequence of it, he} 
\stick{would lose all kind of patience whenever}
\stick{he saw people, especially of condition,}
\stick{who should have known better,\tsh as}
\stck{careless and as indifferent about the name}\catch{they} 
they imposed upon their child,\tsk or
more so, than in the choice of \textit{Ponto} or \textit{Cupid} for
their puppy dog.

This, he would say, look’d ill;\tsk and 
\stick{had, moreover, this particular aggrava-}
\stick{tion in it, \textit{viz}. That when once a vile}
\stick{name was wrongfully or injudiciously} 
\stick{given, ’twas not like the case of a man’s} 
\stick{character, which, when wrong’d, might}
\stick{hereafter be clear’d;\tsh and, possibly,} 
\stick{sometime or other, if not in the man’s life,} 
\stick{at least after his death,\tsk be, somehow} 
\stick{or other, set to rights with the world:}
\stick{But the injury of this, he would say,} 
\stick{could never be undone;\tsk nay, he doubt-}
\stick{ed even whether an act of parliament} 
\stick{could reach it:\tsh He knew as well as}
\stick{you, that the legislature assum’d a power}
\stick{over surnames;\tsk but for very strong} 
\stick{reasons, which he could give, it had ne-}\catch{ver} 
\stick{ver yet adventured, he would say, to go}
a step further.

\noindent
\stick{\hfill It was observable, that tho’ my father,} in consequence of
this opinion, had, as I have told you, the strongest likings and
dislikings towards certain names;\tsk that there were still
numbers of names which hung so equally in the balance before
\stck{him, that they were absolutely indifferent}
\stick{to him. \textit{Jack}, \textit{Dick}, and \textit{Tom} were of}
\stick{this class: These my father call’d neutral}
\stick{names;\tsk affirming of them, without a}
\stick{satyr, That there had been as many}
\stick{knaves and fools, at least, as wise and}
\stick{good men, since the world began, who}
\stick{had indifferently borne them;\tsk so that,}
\stck{like equal forces acting against each other}
\stick{in contrary directions, he thought they}
\stick{mutually destroyed each others effects;}
\stick{for which reason, he would often declare,}\catch{He}
He would not give a cherry-stone to\break
choose amongst them. \textit{Bob}, which was\break
my brother’s name, was another of these neutral kinds of
Christian names, which operated very little either way; and as my
father happen’d to be at \textit{Epsom}, when it was given him,\tsk he would
oft times thank heaven it was no worse. \textit{Andrew} was something
like a negative quantity in Algebra with him;\tsk ’twas
worse, he said, than nothing.\tsk \textit{William} stood pret-\break ty
high:\tsh \textit{Numps} again was low with him:\tsk and
\textit{Nick}, he said, was the \textscl{Devil}.

But, of all the names in the universe,\break he had the most unconquerable aversion for
\textscl{Tristram};\tsk he had the lowest and most contemptible opinion
of it of any thing in the world,\tsk thinking it
could \tight{possibly produce
nothing in \textit{rerum naturâ},} but what was extreamly mean and piti-\catch{ful:}
\stick{ful: So that in the midst of a dispute}
\stick{on the subject, in which, by the bye, he} 
\stick{was frequently involved,\tsh he would}
\stick{sometimes break off in a sudden and spi-}
\stick{rited \textscl{Epiphonema}, or rather \textscl{Erotesis},} 
\stick{raised a third, and sometimes a full fifth,} 
\stick{above the key of the discourse,\tsh and} 
\stick{demand it categorically of his antagonist,} 
\stick{Whether he would take upon him to say,} 
\stick{he had ever remember’d,\tsk whether he}
\stick{had ever read,\tsk or even whether he had}
\stick{ever heard tell of a man, call’d \textit{Tristram},}
\stick{performing any thing great or worth re-}
\stick{cording?\tsk No\tsk, he would say,\tsk \textscl{Tri}-}
\textscl{stram}!\tsk The thing is impossible.

What could be wanting in my father but to have wrote a book to
publish this notion of his to the world? Little boots it to the
subtle speculatist to stand single in his opinions,\tsk unless he
gives them\catch{proper}
\stick{proper vent:\tsk It was the identical thing}
\stick{which my father did:\tsk for in the year} 
\stck{sixteen, which was two years before I was} 
\stick{born, he was at the pains of writing an} 
\stick{express \textscl{Dissertation} simply upon the} 
\stick{word \textit{Tristram},\tsk shewing the world, with}
\stick{great candour and modesty, the grounds} 
of his great abhorrence to the name.

When this story is compared with the 
\stick{title-page,\tsk Will not the gentle reader} 
\stick{pity my father from his soul?\tsk to see an}
\stck{orderly and well-disposed gentleman, who}
\stick{tho’ singular,\tsk yet inoffensive in his no-}
\stick{tions,\tsk so played upon in them by cross}
\stick{purposes;\tsh to look down upon the}
\stick{stage, and see him baffled and over-}
\stck{thrown in all his little systems and wishes;}
\stick{to behold a train of events perpetually}
\stick{falling out against him, and in so critical} 
\stick{and cruel a way, as if they had purposed-}\catch{ly} 
\stick{ly been plann’d and pointed against him,}
\stick{merely to insult his speculations.\tsh In}
\stick{a word, to behold such a one, in his old}
\stick{age, ill-fitted for troubles, ten times in}
\stick{a day suffering sorrow;\tsk ten times in a}
\stick{day calling the child of his prayers \textscl{Tri}-}
\stick{\textscl{stram}!\tsh Melancholy dissyllable of}
\stick{sound! which, to his ears, was unison}
\stick{to \textit{Nicompoop}, and every name vitupera-}
\stick{tive under heaven.\tsh By his ashes! I}
\stick{swear it,\tsk if ever malignant spirit took}
\stick{pleasure, or busied itself in traversing the}
\stick{purposes of mortal man,\tsk it must have}
\stick{been here;\tsk and if it was not necessary I}
\stick{should be born before I was christened,}
\stick{I would this moment give the reader an}
account of it.

le Conseil estime que l’on pourroit se servir du\break

Dieu n’ a point laissé ces sortes d’enfans\break
sans aucuns secours, \et\ supposant, comme\break
il est exposé, que le moyen dont il s’agit est\break
propre à leur procurer le baptême\textnormal{;} cependant\break
comme il s’agiroit, en autorisant la pratique\break
\tight{proposée, de changer une régle universellement}\break
établie, le Conseil croit que celui qui consulte\break
doit s’addresser a son évêque, \et\ à qui il ap-\catch{partient}
partient de juger de l’utilité, \et\ du danger\break
du moyen proposé, \et\ comme, sous le bon\break
plaisir de l’evêque, le conseil estime qu’il fau-\break
droit recourir au Pape, qui a le droit d’ex-\break
pliquer les régles de l’eglise, et d’ y déroger\break
dans le cas, ou la loi ne sçauroit obliger, quel-\break
\tighter{que sage \et\ quelque utile que paroisse la maniére}\break
de baptiser dont il s’agit, le conseil ne pourroit\break
l’approver sans le concours de ces deux auto-\break
\tight{rités. On conseile au moins à celui qui consulte,}\break
de s’addresser à son evêque, \et\ de lui faire part\break
de la presente décision, afin que, si le prelat\break
\tight{entre dans les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs}\break
soussignés s’appuyent, il puisse être autorisé\break
dans le cas de nécessité, ou il risqueroit trop\break
d'attendre que la permission fût demandée \et\ \break
accordée d’employer le moyen qu’il propose si\break
avantageux au salut de l’enfant. Au reste\break
le conseil, en estimant que l’on pourroit s’en\break
servir croit cependant, que si les enfans dont\break
il s’agit, venoient au monde, contre l’esperance\catch{de}
de ceux qui se séroient servis du même moyen, il séroit nécessaire de
les baptiser \textnormal{sous cond\-ition,} \et\ en cela le conseil se conforme à
tous les rituels, qui en autorisant le baptême d’un enfant qui fait paroître quelque
partie de son corps, enjoignent néantmoins, \et\ ordonnent de le baptiser
\textnormal{sous condition}, s’il vient heu\-reusement au monde.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XXI.}

\quad\tsh I wonder what’s
all that noise,\break and running backwards and forwards\break for, above
stairs, quoth my father, addressing himself, after an hour and a\break
half’s silence, to my uncle \textit{Toby},\tsh who\catch{you}
you must know, was sitting on the opposite side of the fire,
smoking his social pipe all the time, in mute contemplation of a
new pair of black-plush-breeches\break
which he had got on:\tsk What
can they be doing brother? quoth my father,\tsk\break we can
scarce hear ourselves talk.

I think, replied my uncle \textit{Toby}, taking his pipe from his
mouth, and striking\break the head of it two or three times upon the nail
of his left thumb, as he began his sentence,\tsh I think,
says he:\tsh\break But to enter rightly into my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s sentiments upon this matter, you must be made
to enter first a little into his\break character, the out-lines of which
I shall just give you, and then the dialogue between
him and my father will go on as well again.\patch{\tsk Pray}

\tsk Pray what was that man’s name,\tsk\break for I write in such a
hurry, I have no time to recollect or look for it,\tsh who
first made the observation, \lqq That there was great
inconstancy in our air and climate?” Whoever he was,
’twas a just and good observation in him.\tsk But the
corollary drawn from it, namely, \lqq That\break it is this which
has furnished us with such a variety of odd and whimsical
characters;”\tsk that was not his;\tsk it was\break found out
by another man, at least a\break century and a half after him:\tsk Then\break
again,\tsk that this copious store-house of 
\stick{original materials, is the true and natural}
\stick{cause that our Comedies are so much bet-}
\stck{ter than those of \textit{France}, or any others that}
\stick{either have, or can be wrote upon the}
\stick{Continent;\tsh that discovery was not}
\stick{fully made till about the middle of king}
\textit{William}’s reign,\tsk when the great \textit{Dryden},\catch{in} in writing one of his
long prefaces, (if I mistake not) most fortunately hit upon\break
\stick{it. Indeed toward the latter end of}
\stick{queen \textit{Anne}, the great \textit{Addison} began to}
\stick{patronize the notion, and more fully ex-}
\stick{plained it to the world in one or two of} 
\stick{his Spectators;\tsk but the discovery was} 
\stick{not his.\tsk Then, fourthly and lastly, that}
\stick{this strange irregularity in our climate,}
\stick{producing so strange an irregularity in} 
\stick{our characters,\tsh doth thereby, in} 
\stick{some sort, make us amends, by giving} 
\stck{us somewhat to make us merry with when} 
\stick{the weather will not suffer us to go out}
\stick{of doors,\tsk that observation is my own;\tsk}
\stick{and was struck out by me this very rainy} 
\stick{day, \textit{March} 26, 1759, and betwixt the}
hours of nine and ten in the morning.

Thus,\tsk thus my fellow labourers and associates in this great harvest of
our\catch{learning,} learning, now ripening before our eyes; thus it is, by slow steps of casual
increase, that our knowledge physical, metaphy\-sical, physiological, polemical,
nautical, mathematical, ænigmatical, technical,\break biographical, romantical,
chemical, and 
\stick{obstetrical, with fifty other branches of it,}\break
(most of ’em ending, as these do, in \textit{ical}) have, for these two last
centuries and more, gradually been creeping upwards towards that Ακμὴ of their
perfections,\break 
\stick{from which, if we may form a conjecture} 
\stick{from the advances of these last seven} 
years, we cannot possibly be far off.

When that happens, it is to be hoped, it will put an end to all
kind of writings whatsoever;\tsk the want of all kind of writing
will put an end to all kind of\break reading;\tsk and that in time,
\textit{As war be\-gets poverty; poverty peace},\tsh must, in\catch{course,}
course, put an end to all kind of know\-ledge,\tsk and
then\tsh we shall have all to begin over again; or, in
other words, be exactly where we started.

\tsh Happy! thrice happy Times! I~only wish that the æra of my begetting, as well
as the mode and manner of it, had been a little alter’d,\tsk or that it could have
been put off with any convenience to my father or mother, for some twenty or
five-and-twenty years longer, when~a man in the literary world might have\break
stood some chance.\tsh 

But I forget my uncle \textit{Toby}, whom all\break
this while we have left knocking the\break
ashes out of his tobacco-pipe.

His humour was of that particular\break
species, which does honour to our atmo-\catch{sphere;}
sphere; and I should have made no scruple of ranking him
amongst one of the first-rate productions of it, had not there
appear’d too many strong lines in it of~a family-likeness, which
shewed that he derived the singularity of his temper\break
more from blood, than either wind or\break 
water, or any modifications or combina-\break
tions of them whatever: And I have, therefore, oft times
wondered, that my father, tho’ I believe he had his reasons
for it, upon his observing some tokens\break of excentricity in my
course when I was a boy,\tsk should never once endeavour to
account for them in this way; for all the\break
\stick{\textscl{Shandy Family} were of an original}
\stick{character throughout;\tsh I mean the}
\stick{males,\tsk the females had no character at}
all,\tsk except, indeed, my great aunt \textscl{Di\-nah}, 
who, about sixty years ago, was 
married and got with child by the coach-\catch{man,} 
man, for which my father, according to his hypothesis of Christian
names, would often say, She might thank her godfathers and
godmothers.

It will seem very strange,\tsh and I\break 
\stick{would as soon think of dropping a riddle}
\stick{in the reader’s way, which is not my in-}
\stick{terest to do, as set him upon guessing}
\stick{how it could come to pass, that an event}
of this kind, so many years after it had happened,
should be reserved for the interruption of the peace and unity,
which 
\stck{otherwise so cordially subsisted, between}
\stick{my father and my uncle \textit{Toby}. One}
\stick{would have thought, that the whole}
\stick{force of the misfortune should have}
\stick{spent and wasted itself in the family at}
\stick{first,\tsk as is generally the case:\tsk But no-}
\stick{thing ever wrought with our family af-}
\stick{ter the ordinary way. Possibly at the}\catch{very}
very time this happened, it might have 
something else to afflict it; and as afflictions
are sent down for our good, and that as this
had never done the \textscl{Shandy Family}
any good at all, it might lye\break
waiting till apt times and circumstances 
\stck{should give it an opportunity to discharge}
\stick{its office.\tsh Observe, I determine}
\stick{nothing upon this.\tsh My way is}
\stick{ever to point out to the curious, differ-}
ent tracts of investigation, to come at
the first springs of the events I tell;\tsk\break not with a pedantic
\textit{Fescue},\tsk or in the decisive Manner of \textit{Tacitus},
who outwits himself and his reader;\tsk but with the\break officious
humility of a heart devoted to 
\stck{the assistance merely of the inquisitive;\tsk}
to them I write,\tsh and by them I
shall be read,\tsh if any such reading as this could be
supposed to hold out so long,\break
to the very end of the
world.\\\rightline{Why}\eject

Why this cause of sorrow, therefore, was thus reserved for my
father and uncle, is undetermined by me. But how and in what
direction it exerted itself, so as to become the cause of
dissatisfaction between them, after it began to operate, is what I
am able to explain with great exactness, and is as follows:

My uncle \textscl{Toby Shandy}, Madam,\break 
\stick{was a gentleman, who, with the virtues} 
\stick{which usually constitute the character of}
\stick{a man of honour and rectitude,\tsk posses-}
\stick{sed one in a very eminent degree, which} 
\stick{is seldom or never put into the catalogue;}
\stick{and that was a most extream and unpa-}
\stick{rallel’d modesty of nature;\tsh tho’ I}
\stick{correct the word nature, for this reason,} 
\stick{that I may not prejudge a point which} 
\stick{must shortly come to a hearing; and that} 
\stick{is, Whether this modesty of his was na-}\catch{tural}
\stick{tural or acquir’d.\tsh Which ever}
\stick{way my uncle \textit{Toby} came by it, ’twas} 
\stick{nevertheless modesty in the truest sense} 
\stick{of it; and that is, Madam, not in regard}
\stick{to words, for he was so unhappy as to} 
\stick{have very little choice in them,\tsk but to}
\stick{things;\tsh and this kind of modesty so}
\stick{possess’d him, and it arose to such a} 
\stick{height in him, as almost to equal, if}
\stick{such a thing could be, even the modesty} 
\stick{of a woman: That female nicety, Ma-}
\stick{dam, and inward cleanliness of mind and} 
\stick{fancy, in your sex, which makes you so} 
much the awe of ours.

You will imagine, Madam, that my
\stick{uncle \textit{Toby} had contracted all this from} 
\stick{this very source;\tsk that he had spent a} 
\stick{great part of his time in converse with} 
\stick{your sex; and that, from a thorough}
\stick{knowledge of you, and the force of imita-}\catch{tion}
\stick{tion which such fair examples render ir-}
\stick{resistable,\tsk he had acquired this amiable}
turn of mind.

I wish I could say so,\tsk for unless it was with his sister-in-law, my father’s
wife and my mother,\tsh my uncle \textit{Toby} scarce exchanged three words with the
sex in as many years;\tsh no, he got it, Madam, by a blow.\tsh A blow!\tsk Yes,
Madam, it was owing to a blow from a stone, broke off by a ball from the para\-pet of
a horn-work at the siege of \textit{Namur}, which struck full upon my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s groin.\tsk Which way could that effect it?  The story of that,
Madam, is long and interesting;\tsk but it would be running my history all upon
heaps to give it you here.\tsh ’Tis for an episode hereafter; and every circumstance
relating to it in its proper place, shall be faithfully laid\catch{before}
\stick{before you:\tsk ’Till then, it is not in my}
\stick{power to give further light into this}
\stick{matter, or say more than what I have} 
\stick{said already,\tsk That my uncle \textit{Toby} was}
\stick{a gentleman of unparallel’d modesty,}
\stick{which happening to be somewhat sub-}
\stick{tilized and rarified by the constant heat} 
\stick{of a little family-pride,\tsh they both so}
\stick{wrought together within him, that he}
\stick{could never bear to hear the affair of my}
\stick{aunt \textscl{Dinah} touch’d upon, but with the}
\stick{greatest emotion.\tsh The least hint of it} 
\stick{was enough to make the blood fly into}
\stick{his face;\tsk but when my father enlarged}
\stick{upon the story in mixed companies,} 
\stick{which the illustration of his hypothesis}
\stick{frequently obliged him to do,\tsk the un-}
\stick{fortunate blight of one of the fairest}
\stick{branches of the family, would set my} 
\stck{uncle \textit{Toby}’s honour and modesty o’bleed-}
\stick{ing; and he would often take my fa-}\catch{ther}
\stick{ther aside, in the greatest concern ima-}
\stick{ginable, to expostulate and tell him, he}
\stick{would give him any thing in the world,}
only to let the story rest.

My father, I believe, had the truest love and tenderness for my uncle \textit{Toby},
that ever one brother bore towards ano-\break
\stick{ther, and would have done any thing in}
\stck{nature, which one brother in reason could}
\stick{have desir’d of another, to have made my}
\stick{uncle \textit{Toby}’s heart easy in this, or any o-}
\stick{ther point. But this lay out of his power.}

\tsk My father, as I told you was a\break 
\stick{philosopher in grain,\tsk speculative,\tsk}
\stick{systematical;\tsk and my aunt \textit{Dinah}’s af-}
\stick{fair was a matter of as much consequence}
\stick{to him, as the retrogradation of the pla-}
\stick{nets to \textit{Copernicus}:\tsk The backslidings of}
\stick{\textit{Venus} in her orbit fortified the \textit{Copernican}}\catch{system}
system, call’d so after his name; and the backslidings of my
aunt \textit{Dinah} in her orbit, did the same service in
establishing my father’s system, which, I trust, will for ever
hereafter be call’d the \textit{Shandean System}, after his.

In any other family dishonour, my father, I believe, had as nice
a sense of shame as any man whatever;\tsh and neither he,
nor, I dare say, \textit{Copernicus}, would have divulged the affair
in either 
\stick{case, or have taken the least notice of it}
\stick{to the world, but for the obligations}
\stick{they owed, as they thought, to truth.\tsk}
\stick{\textit{Amicus Plato}, my father would say, con-}
\stick{struing the words to my uncle \textit{Toby}, as}
\stick{he went along, \textit{Amicus Plato}; that is,}
\stick{\textscl{Dinah} was my aunt;\tsk \textit{sed magis amica}}
\textit{veritas}\tsk but \textscl{Truth} is my sister.\patch{This}

This contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle, was
the source of many a fraternal squabble. The one could not bear to
hear the tale of family disgrace recorded,\tsh and the
other would scarce ever let a day pass to an end without some hint
at it.

For God’s sake, my uncle \textit{Toby} would
cry,\tsh and for my sake, and for all our\break sakes, my dear
brother \textit{Shandy},\tsk do let this story of our aunt’s
and her ashes sleep in peace;\tsk how can
you,\tsh\break how can you have so little feeling and compassion
for the character of our fa\-mily:\tsh What is the character
of a fa\-mily to an hypothesis? my father would\break
reply.\tsh Nay, if you come to that\tsk
\break what is the
life of a family:\tsh The life of a family!\tsk my uncle
\textit{Toby} would say, throwing himself back in his arm-\catch{chair,}
chair, and
lifting up his hands, his eyes, and one
leg.\tsh Yes, the life,\tsh my\break father would say,
maintaining his point. How many thousands of ’em are there
every year that comes cast away, (in all civilized countries at
least)\tsh and con-\break sider’d as nothing but common air, in
competition of an hypothesis. In my plain sense of things, my uncle
\textit{Toby},\break 
\stick{would answer,\tsk every such instance}
\stick{is downright \textscl{Murder}, let who will}
commit it.\tsh There
lies your mistake, my father would reply;\tsh for, in
\textit{Foro Scientiæ} there is no such thing as
\textscl{Murder},\tsh ’tis only
\textscl{Death}, brother.

My uncle \textit{Toby} would never offer to answer this by any
other kind of argument, than that of whistling half a dozen bars of
\textit{Lillabullero}.\tsh You must know\catch{it} it was the usual
channel thro’ which his passions got vent, when any thing
shock\-ed or surprised him;\tsh but especially when any
thing, which he deem’d very\break absurd, was offered.

As not one of our logical writers, nor 
\stick{any of the commentators upon them,} 
\stick{that I remember, have thought proper to}
\stick{give a name to this particular species of} 
\stick{argument,\tsk I here take the liberty to do}
\stick{it myself, for two reasons. First, That,}
\stick{in order to prevent all confusion in dis-}
\stick{putes, it may stand as much distinguish-}
\stick{ed for ever, from every other species of}
\stick{argument,\tsh as the \textit{Argumentum ad}}
\stck{\textit{Verecundiam}, \textit{ex Absurdo}, \textit{ex Fortiori}, or any}
\stick{other argument whatsoever:\tsh And,}
\stick{secondly, That it may be said by my chil-}
\stick{dren’s children, when my head is laid to}
\stick{rest,\tsh that their learned grand father’s}\catch{head}
\stick{head had been busied to as much pur-}
\stick{pose once, as other people’s:\tsk That he} 
\stick{had invented a name,\tsk and generously}
\stick{thrown it into the \textscl{Treasury} of the} 
\stick{\textit{Ars Logica}, for one of the most unan-}
\stick{swerable arguments in the whole science.} 
\stick{And if the end of disputation is more to} 
\stick{silence than convince,\tsk they may add, if} 
\stick{they please, to one of the best arguments}
too.

I do therefore, by these presents,\break 
strictly order and command, That it be 
known and distinguished by the name
\stck{and title of the \textit{Argumentum Fistulatorium},} 
\stick{and no other;\tsk and that it rank here-}
\stck{after with the \textit{Argumentum Baculinum} and}
the \textit{Argumentum ad Crumenam}, and for 
ever hereafter be treated of in the same 
chapter.\patch{As}

\tighter{As for the \textit{Argumentum Tripodium}, which}\break
is never used but
by the woman against the man;\tsk and the \textit{Argumentum ad
Rem}, which, contrarywise, is made use of by the man only
against the woman:\tsk As these two are enough in conscience for
one lecture;\tsh and, moreover, as the one is the best
answer to the other,\tsk let\break 
them likewise be kept apart, and be\break
treated of in a place by themselves.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XXII.}

\dropcap{T}{he} learned Bishop \textit{Hall}, I mean\break 
the famous Dr.\@ \textit{Joseph Hall}, who\break
was Bishop of \textit{Exeter} in King \textit{James} the\break 
First’s reign, tells us in one of his \textit{Decads},\break
at the end of his divine art of meditation,\break
imprinted at \textit{London}, in the year 1610,\break
by \textit{John Beal}, dwelling in \textit{Aldersgate-street},\catch{\lqq That}
\stick{\lqq That it is an abominable thing for a}
\stick{man to commend himself;”\tsh and I real-}
ly think it is so.

And yet, on the other hand, when a 
\stick{thing is executed in a masterly kind of a} 
\stick{fashion, which thing is not likely to be} 
\stick{found out;\tsk I think it is full as abomi-}
\stick{nable, that a man should lose the ho-}
\stick{nour of it, and go out of the world with} 
the conceit of it rotting in his head.

This is precisely my situation.

For in this long digression which I was 
\stick{accidentally led into, as in all my digres-}
\stick{sions (one only excepted) there is a} 
\stick{master-stroke of digressive skill, the me-}
\stick{rit of which has all along, I fear, been} 
\stick{overlooked by my reader,\tsk not for want}
\stick{of penetration in him,\tsk but because ’tis}\catch{an}
\stick{an excellence seldom looked for, or ex-}
\stick{pected indeed, in a digression;\tsk and it} 
\stick{is this: That tho’ my digressions are all}
\stick{fair, as you observe,\tsk and that I fly off}
\stick{from what I am about, as far, and as of-}
\stick{ten too as any writer in \textit{Great-Britain};}
\stick{yet I constantly take care to order affairs}
\stick{so, that my main business does not stand} 
still in my absence.

I was just going, for example, to have 
\stick{given you the great out-lines of my uncle}
\stick{\textit{Toby}’s most whimsical character;\tsk when}
\stick{my aunt \textit{Dinah} and the coachman came}
\stick{a-cross us, and led us a vagary some mil-}
\stick{lions of miles into the very heart of the}
\stick{planetary system: Notwithstanding all} 
\stick{this you perceive that the drawing of} 
\stick{my uncle \textit{Toby}’s character went on gently} 
\stick{all the time;\tsk not the great contours of}
\stick{it,\tsk that was impossible,\tsk but some fa-}\catch{miliar}
\stick{miliar strokes and faint designations of} 
\stick{it, were here and there touch’d in, as we} 
\stick{went along, so that you are much better} 
\stick{acquainted with my uncle \textit{Toby} now than} 
you was before.

By this contrivance the machinery of
\stick{my work is of a species by itself; two} 
\stick{contrary motions are introduced into it,} 
\stick{and reconciled, which were thought to} 
\stick{be at variance with each other. In a} 
\stick{word, my work is digressive, and it is} 
progressive too,\tsk and at the same time.

This, Sir, is a very different story\break
\stick{from that of the earth’s moving round}
\stick{her axis, in her diurnal rotation, with her}
\stick{progress in her elliptick orbit which}
\stick{brings about the year, and constitutes} 
\stick{that variety and vicissitude of seasons we} 
\stick{enjoy;\tsk though I own it suggested the}\catch{thought,}
\stick{thought,\tsk as I believe the greatest of}
\stick{our boasted improvements and discove-}
\stick{ries have come from some such trifling}
hints.

\tight{Digressions, incontestably, are the sun-}
\stick{shine;\tsh they are the life, the soul of} 
\stick{reading;\tsk take them out of this book,} 
\stick{for instance,\tsk you might as well take the}
\stick{book along with them;\tsk one cold eternal} 
\stick{winter would reign in every page of it;} 
\stick{restore them to the writer;\tsk he steps} 
\stick{forth like a bridegroom,\tsk bids All hail;} 
\stick{brings in variety, and forbids the appe-}
tite to fail.

All the dexterity is in the good cook-
\stick{ery and management of them, so as to}
\stick{be not only for the advantage of the}
\stick{reader, but also of the author, whose di-}
\stick{stress, in this matter, is truely pitiable:}\catch{For}
\stick{For, if he begins a digression,\tsk from} 
\stick{that moment, I observe, his whole work}
\stick{stands stock still;\tsk and if he goes on}
\stick{with his main work,\tsh then there is an}
end of his digression.

\tsh This is vile work.\tsk For which
\stick{reason, from the beginning of this, you}
\stick{see, I have constructed the main work}
\stick{and the adventitious parts of it with such} 
\stick{intersections, and have so complicated} 
\stick{and involved the digressive and progres-}
\stick{sive movements, one wheel within ano-}
\stick{ther, that the whole machine, in general,} 
\stick{has been kept a-going;\tsk and, what’s}
\stick{more, it shall be kept a-going these forty} 
\stick{years, if it pleases the fountain of health} 
\stick{to bless me so long with life and good}
spirits.\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

\stick{bols, her capricios; and ofter some no-}\sic\break
\stick{tice of her more solemn deportment, con-}
\stick{sequent upon such frisks, \et\textit{c}.\tsh then}
\stick{taken your pen and ink and set down}
\stick{nothing but what you had seen, and}
\stick{could have sworn to:\tsk But this is an}
\stick{advantage not to be had by the bio-}
\stick{grapher in this planet,\tsk in the planet}
\stick{\textit{Mercury} (belike) it may be so, if not}
\stick{better still for him;\tsh for there the in-}
\stick{tense heat of the country, which is pro-}
\stick{ved by computators, from its vicinity to}
\stick{the sun, to be more than equal to that}\catch{of}
\stick{of red hot iron,\tsk must, I think, long ago}
\stick{have vitrified the bodies of the inhabi-}
\stick{tants, (as the efficient cause) to suit them}
\stick{for the climate (which is the final cause);}
\stick{so that betwixt them both, all the tene-}
\stick{ments of their souls, from top to bot-}
\stick{tom, may be nothing else, for aught the} 
\stck{soundest philosophy can shew to the con-}
\stick{trary, but one fine transparent body of} 
\stick{clear glass (bating the umbilical knot);\tsk}
\stick{so, that till the inhabitants grow old and} 
\stick{tolerably wrinkled, whereby the rays of} 
\stick{light, in passing through them, become}
\stick{so monstrously refracted,\tsh or return}
\stick{reflected from their surfaces in such}
\stick{transverse lines to the eye, that a man} 
\stick{cannot be seen thro’;\tsk his soul might as} 
\stick{well, unless, for mere ceremony,\tsk or} 
\stick{the trifling advantage which the umbi-}
\stick{lical point gave her,\tsk might, upon all}\catch{other}
\stick{other accounts, I say, as well play the}
fool out o’doors as in her own house.

But this, as I said above, is not the
\stick{case of the inhabitants of this earth;\tsk} 
\stick{our minds shine not through the body,}
\stick{but are wrapt up here in a dark covering} 
\stick{of uncrystalized flesh and blood; so that}
\stick{if we would come to the specifick cha-}
\stick{racters of them, we must go some other}
way to work.

Many, in good truth, are the ways, 
\stick{which human wit has been forced to take} 
to do this thing with exactness.

Some, for instance, draw all their cha-
\stick{racters with wind instruments.\tsk \textit{Virgil}} 
\stick{takes notice of that way in the affair of} 
\stick{\textit{Dido} and \textit{Æneas};\tsk but it is as fallacious}
\stick{as the breath of fame;\tsk and, moreover,}\catch{be-}
\stick{bespeaks a narrow genius. I am not ig-}
\stick{norant that the \textit{Italians} pretend to a ma-}
\stck{thematical exactness in their designations}
\stick{of one particular sort of character among}
\stick{them, from the \textit{forte} or \textit{piano} of a cer-}
\stick{tain wind instrument they use,\tsk which}
\stick{they say is infallible.\tsk I dare not men-}
\stick{tion the name of the instrument in this}
\stick{place;\tsk ’tis sufficient we have it amongst}
\stick{us,\tsk but never think of making a draw-}
\stick{ing by it;\tsk this is ænigmatical, and in-}
\stick{tended to be so, at least, \textit{ad populum:}\tsk}
\stick{And therefore I beg, Madam, when you}
\stick{come here, that you read on as fast as}
\stick{you can, and never stop to make any in-}
quiry about it.

There are others again, who will draw a man’s character
from no other helps in the world, but merely from his
evacuations;\tsk but this often gives a very in-\catch{correct}
correct out-line,\tsk unless, indeed, you\break
take a sketch of his repletions too; and\break
by correcting one drawing from the\break
other, compound one good figure out of\break
them both.

I should have no objection to this me-\break thod, but that I think it
must smell too strong of the lamp,\tsk and be render’d
still more operose, by forcing you to have an eye to the rest of
his \textit{Non-Naturals}.\tsk\break Why the most natural actions of a
man’s life should be call’d his Non-Naturals,\tsk\break is
another question.

There are others, fourthly, who disdain every one of these expedients;\tsk not from
any fertility of his\sic\ own, but from the various ways of doing it, which they have
borrowed from the honourable de-\catch{vices} vices which the Pentagraphic
Brethren~\footnote{\enspace Pentagraph, \vrule width 0pt height 18pt
an instrument to copy prints and pictures
mechanically, and in any proportion.} of the brush have shewn in
taking co\-pies.\tsk 
These, you must know, are your great historians.

\noindent
\stick{\hfill One of these you will see drawing a}
\stick{full length character \textit{against the light};\tsk}
\stick{that’s illiberal,\tsk dishonest,\tsk and hard}
\stick{upon the character of the man who sits.}

Others, to mend the matter, will make a drawing of you in the
\textit{Camera};\tsk that\break
\stick{is most unfair of all,\tsk because, \textit{there} you}
are sure to be represented in some of your most
ridiculous attitudes.

To avoid all and every one of these
\stick{errors, in giving you my uncle \textit{Toby}’s} 
\stick{character, I am determin’d to draw it by}\catch{no}
\stick{no mechanical help whatever;\tsh nor}
\stick{shall my pencil be guided by any one}
\stick{wind instrument which ever was blown} 
\stick{upon, either on this, or on the other} 
\stick{side of the \textit{Alps};\tsk nor will I consider}
\stick{either his repletions or his discharges,\tsk}
\stick{or touch upon his Non-Naturals;\tsk but,} 
\stick{in a word, I will draw my uncle \textit{Toby}’s} 
character from his \textscl{Hobby-Horse}.

\dropcap{I}{f} \tight{I was not morally sure that the
reader} must be out of all patience for my\break
\stick{uncle \textit{Toby}’s character,\tsh I would here}
\stick{previously have convinced him, that}
\stick{there is no instrument so fit to draw such}
\stick{a thing with, as that which I have pitch’d}\break 
upon.\patch{A}

A man and his \lss{\textsc{Hobby-Horse}},\break
tho’ I cannot say that they act and re-act exactly after the
same manner in which the soul and body do upon each other: Yet
doubtless there is a communication between them of some kind, and
my\break
opinion rather is, that there is something in it more of the
manner of electrified bodies,\tsk and that, by means of the
heated parts of the rider, which come immediately into contact with
the back of the \textscl{Hobby-Horse}.\tsk By
long journies and much friction, it so happens that the bo\-dy of
the rider is at length fill’d as full of
\textscl{Hobby-Horsical} matter as it can
hold;\tsk so that if you are able to give\break but a clear description of the nature
of the one, you may form a pretty exact\break notion of the genius and
character of the other.\patch{Now}

Now the \textscl{Hobby-Horse} which my\break
uncle \textit{Toby} always rode upon, was, in my\break
opinion, an \textscl{Hobby-Horse} well worth\break giving
a description of, if it was only upon the score of his great
singularity;\break for you might have travelled from \textit{York} to
\textit{Dover},\tsk from \textit{Dover} to \textit{Penzance} in
\textit{Cornwall}, and from \textit{Penzance} to \textit{York} back
again, and not have seen such another upon the road; or if you had seen
such a one, whatever haste you had been in, you must infallibly have
stopp’d to have taken a view of him. Indeed, the gait and figure of him
was so strange, and so utterly unlike was he, from his head to his tail,
to any one of the whole species, 
\stick{that it was now and then made a matter} 
\stick{of dispute,\tsh whether he was really a}
\stick{\textscl{Hobby-Horse} or no: But as the Philo-}
\stick{sopher would use no other argument to}
\stck{the sceptic, who disputed with him against}\catch{the} 
\stick{the reality of motion, save that of rising}
\stick{up upon his legs, and walking a-cross}
\stick{the room;\tsk so would my uncle \textit{Toby} use} 
\stick{no other argument to prove his \textscl{Hobby-}}
\stick{\textscl{Horse} was a \textscl{Hobby-Horse} indeed,} 
\stick{but by getting upon his back and riding}
\stick{him about;\tsk leaving the world after that} 
to determine the point as it thought fit.

In good truth, my uncle \textit{Toby} mounted him with so much
pleasure, and he carried my uncle \textit{Toby} so
well,\tsh that he troubled his head very little with what
the world either said or thought about\break it.

It is now high time, however, that I give you a description of
him:\tsk But to go on regularly, I only beg you will give me
leave to acquaint you first, how my uncle \textit{Toby} came by
him.\patch{\lss{CHAP}.}

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XXV.}

\dropcap{T}{he} wound in my uncle \textit{Toby}’s\break
groin, which he received at the\break
siege of \textit{Namur}, rendering him unfit for 
the service, it was thought expedient he
should return to \textit{England}, in order, if\break
possible, to be set to rights.

\noindent
\stick{\hfill He was four years totally confined,\tsk}
part of it to his bed, and all of it to his 
room; and in the course of his cure,\break
\stick{which was all that time in hand, suffer’d}
\stick{unspeakable miseries,\tsk owing to a suc-}
\stick{cession of exfoliations from the \textit{oss pubis},}
\stick{and the outward edge of that part of the}
\stick{\textit{coxendix} called the \textit{oss illeum},\tsh both}
\stick{which bones were dismally crush’d, as}
\stick{much by the irregularity of the stone,}
\stick{which I told you was broke off the pa-}
\natch{rapet,}
rapet,\tsk
as by its size,\tsk (though it was pretty large) which inclined
the surgeon all along to think, that the great injury which it
had done my uncle \textit{Toby}’s groin, was more owing to the
gravity of the stone itself, than to the projectile force of
it,\tsk which he would often tell him was a great happiness.

My father at that time was just begin-
\stick{ning business in \textit{London}, and had taken a} 
\stick{house;\tsk and as the truest friendship and} 
\stick{cordiality subsisted between the two bro-}
\stick{thers,\tsk and that my father thought my} 
\stick{uncle \textit{Toby} could no where be so well} 
\stick{nursed and taken care of as in his own} 
\stick{house,\tsh he assign’d him the very best} 
\stick{apartment in it.\tsk And what was a much} 
\stick{more sincere mark of his affection still,} 
\stick{he would never suffer a friend or an ac-}
\stick{quaintance to step into the house on any}\catch{occasion,}
\stick{occasion, but he would take him by the}
\stick{hand, and lead him up stairs to see his}
\stick{brother \textit{Toby}, and chat an hour by his}
bed side.

The history of a soldier’s wound beguiles the pain of
it;\tsk my uncle’s visit-\break
ers at least thought so, and in their daily\break
calls upon him, from the courtesy arising\break
out of that belief, they would frequently\break
turn the discourse to that subject,\tsk and\break
from that subject the discourse would\break
generally roll on to the siege itself.

These conversations were infinitely\break kind; and my uncle
\textit{Toby} received great relief from them, and would have
recei\-ved much more, but that they brought him into some unforeseen
perplexities, which, for three months together, re-\break tarded his
cure greatly; and if he had\catch{not} not hit upon an
expedient to extricate himself out of them, I verily believe they
would have laid him in his grave.

What these perplexities of my uncle 
\stick{\textit{Toby} were,\tsh ’tis impossible for you to}
\stick{guess;\tsk if you could,\tsk I should blush;} 
\stick{not as a relation,\tsk not as a man,\tsk nor}
\stick{even as a woman,\tsk but I should blush as} 
\stick{an author; inasmuch as I set no small} 
\stick{store by myself upon this very account,} 
\stick{that my reader has never yet been able}
\stick{to guess at any thing. And in this, Sir,} 
\stick{I am of so nice and singular a humour,}
\stick{that if I thought you was able to form}
\stick{the least judgment or probable conjecture}
\stick{to yourself, of what was to come in the} 
\stick{next page,\tsk I would tear it out of my}
book.
