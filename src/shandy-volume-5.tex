\stick{the ball to the queen’s apron, and mak-}

\i{La Fosseuse}’s voice was naturally soft\break
\stick{and low, yet ’twas an articulate voice:}
\stick{and every letter of the word \i{whiskers} fell}
\stick{distinctly upon the queen of \i{Navarre}’s}
\stick{ear\tsk Whiskers! cried the queen, laying}

\patch[10pt]{The}

The word whiskers still stood its\break
\stick{ground, and continued to be made use}
\stick{of in most of the best companies through-}
\stick{out the little kingdom of \i{Navarre}, not-}
\stick{withstanding the indiscreet use which \i{La}}
\stick{\i{Fosseuse} had made of it: the truth was,}
\stick{\i{La Fosseuse} had pronounced the word,}
\stick{not only before the queen, but upon sun-}
\stick{dry other occasions at court, with an ac-}
\stick{cent which always implied something of}
\stick{a mystery\tsh And as the court of \i{Mar}-}
\stick{\i{garet}, as all the world knows, was at}
\stick{that time a mixture of gallantry and de-}
\stick{votion\tsh and whiskers being as appli-}
\stick{cable to the one, as the other, the word}
\stick{naturally stood its ground\tsk it gain’d full}
\stick{as much as it lost; that is, the clergy}

The excellency of the figure and mien\break
\stick{of the young Sieur \i{de Croix}, was at that}
\stick{time beginning to draw the attention of}
\stick{the maids of honour towards the terras}
\stick{before the palace gate, where the guard}
\stick{was mounted. The Lady \i{de Baussiere}}
\stick{fell deeply in love with him,\tsh \i{La Batta}-}
\stick{\i{relle} did the same\tsk it was the finest wea-}
\stick{ther for it, that ever was remembered in}
\stick{\i{Navarre}\tsk \i{La Guyol}, \i{La Maronette}, \i{La}}
\stick{\i{Sabatiere}, fell in love with the Sieur \i{de}}
\stick{\i{Croix} also\tsk \i{La Rebours} and \i{La Fosseuse}}
\stick{knew better\tsk \i{De Croix} had failed in an}
\stick{attempt to recommend himself to \i{La}}
\stick{\i{Rebours}; and \i{La Rebours} and \i{La Fosseuse}}
were inseparable.

The queen of \i{Navarre} was sitting with\break
\stick{her ladies in the painted bow-window,}
\stick{facing the gate of the second court, as}
\stick{\i{De Croix} passed through it\tsk He is hand-}

\stick{finely shaped, said \i{La Guyol}.\tsk I never}
\stick{saw an officer of the horse-guards in my}
\stick{life, said \i{La Maronette}, with two such}
\stick{legs\tsk Or who stood so well upon them,}
\stick{said \i{La Sabatiere}\tsh But he has no whis-}

\i{La Rebours}.

\stick{\i{Fosseuse} mean? said she, kneeling down}
upon the cushion.

\i{La Guyol}, \i{La Battarelle}, \i{La Maronette},\break
\stick{\i{La Sabatiere}, retired instantly to their}
\stick{chambers\tsk Whiskers! said all four of}
\catch{them}
\stick{them to themselves, as they bolted their}
doors on the inside.

The Lady \i{Carnavallette} was counting\break

There are some trains of certain ideas\break
\stick{which leave prints of themselves about}

\stick{consciousness of it, somewhere about the}
\catch{heart,}

Ha, ha! hee, hee! cried \i{La Guyol} and\break

St.\@ \i{Bridget}.

\i{La Fosseuse} drew her bodkin from the\break
\stick{knot of her hair, and having traced the}
\stick{outline of a small whisker, with the blunt}
\stick{end of it, upon one side of her upper lip,}

\stick{\tsk Fy, said the Lady \i{Baussiere}. The queen}
\stick{of \i{Navarre} touched her eye with the tip}
\stick{of her fore finger\tsk as much as to say, I}
understand you all.

’Twas plain to the whole court the\break
\stick{word was ruined: \i{La Fosseuse} had given}
\stick{it a wound, and it was not the better for}
\stick{passing through all these defiles\tsk It}
\stick{made a faint stand, however, for a few}
\stick{months; by the expiration of which,}
\stick{the Sieur \i{de Croix}, finding it high time}
\stick{to leave \i{Navarre} for want of whiskers\tsk}
\stick{the word in course became indecent, and}
\stick{(after a few efforts) absolutely unfit for}
use.

The best word, in the best language\break
\stick{of the best world, must have suffered un-}
\catch{der}
\stick{der such combinations.\tsh The curate of}
\stick{\i{d’Estella} wrote a book against them, set-}
\stick{ting forth the dangers of accessory ideas,}
and warning the \i{Navarois} against them.

Does not all the world know, said the\break
\stick{curate \i{d’Estella} at the conclusion of his}
\stick{work, that Noses ran the same fate some}
\stick{centuries ago in most parts of \i{Europe},}
\stick{which Whiskers have now done in the}
\stick{kingdom of \i{Navarre}\tsk The evil indeed}
\stick{spread no farther then\tsk, but have not}
\stick{beds and bolsters, and night-caps and}
\stick{chamber-pots stood upon the brink of de-}

\dropcap{W}{hen} my father received the\break
letter which brought him the\break
\stck{melancholy account of my brother \i{Bobby}’s}
\stick{death, he was busy calculating the ex-}
\stick{pence of his riding post from \i{Calais} to}
\i{Paris}, and so on to \i{Lyons}.

’Twas a most inauspicious journey;\break
\stick{my father having had every foot of it to}
\stick{travel over again, and his calculation to}
\stick{begin afresh, when he had almost got}
\catch{to}
\baselineskip 12.5pt
\stick{to the end of it, by \i{Obadiah}’s opening}
\stick{the door to acquaint him the family was}
\stick{out of yeast\tsk and to ask whether he}
\stick{might not take the great coach-horse}
\stick{early in the morning, and ride in search}
\stick{of some.\tsk With all my heart, \i{Obadiah},}
\stick{said my father, (pursuing his journey)\tsk}
\stick{take the coach-horse, and welcome.\tsk}
\stick{But he wants a shoe, poor creature! said}
\stick{\i{Obadiah}.\tsk Poor creature! said my uncle}
\stick{\toby, vibrating the note back again, like}
\stick{a string in unison. Then ride the \i{Scotch}}
\stick{horse, quoth my father hastily.\tsk He can-}
\stick{not bear a saddle upon his back, quoth}
\stick{\i{Obadiah}, for the whole world.\tsk}
\stick{The devil’s in that horse; then take}
\stick{\s{Patriot}, cried my father, and shut}
\stick{the door.\tsk \s{Patriot} is sold, said}
\stick{\i{Obadiah}.\tsk Here’s for you!\@ cried my fa-}
\stick{ther, making a pause, and looking in}
\stick{my uncle \toby's face, as if the thing had}
\stick{not been a matter of fact.\tsk Your wor-}
\catch{ship}
\stick{ship ordered me to sell him last \i{April},}
\stick{said \i{Obadiah}.\tsk Then go on foot for your}
\stick{pains, cried my father.\tsk I had much ra-}
\stick{ther walk than ride, said \i{Obadiah}, shut-}
ting the door.

What plagues! cried my father, go-\break
\stick{ing on with his calculation.\tsk But the}
\stick{waters are out, said \i{Obadiah},\tsk opening}
the door again.

Till that moment, my father, who\break
\stick{had a map of \i{Sanson}’s, and a book of the}
\stick{post-roads before him, had kept his hand}
\stick{upon the head of his compasses, with one}
\stick{foot of them fixed upon \i{Nevers}, the last}
\stick{stage he had paid for\tsk purposing to go}
\stick{on from that point with his journey and}
\stick{calculation, as soon as \i{Obadiah} quitted}
\stick{the room; but this second attack of \i{Oba}-}
\stick{\i{diah}’s, in opening the door and laying}
\stick{the whole country under water, was too}
\stick{much.\tsk He let go his compasses\tsk or ra-}
\catch{ther}
\stick{ther with a mixed motion betwixt acci-}
\stick{dent and anger, he threw them upon the}
\stick{table; and then there was nothing for}
\stck{him to do, but to return back to \i{Calais} (like}
many others) as wise as he had set out.

When the letter was brought into the\break
\stick{parlour, which contained the news of}
\stick{my brother’s death, my father had got}
\stick{forwards again upon his journey to with-}
\stick{in a stride of the compasses of the very}
\stick{same stage of \i{Nevers}.\tsk By your leave,}
\stick{Mons.\@ \i{Sanson}, cried my father, striking}
\stick{the point of his compasses through \i{Ne}-}
\stick{\i{vers} into the table,\tsk and nodding to my}
\stick{uncle \toby, to see what was in the letter,}
\stck{\tsk twice of one night is too much for an}
\stick{English gentleman and his son, Mons.}
\stick{\i{Sanson}, to be turned back from so lousy}
\stick{a town as \i{Nevers},\tsk what think’st thou,}
\stick{\toby, added my father in a sprightly tone.}
\stick{\tsk Unless it be a garrison town, said my}
\stick{uncle \toby,\tsk for then\tsk I shall be a fool,}
\catch{said}
\stick{said my father, smiling to himself, as}
\stick{long as I live.\tsk So giving a second nod}
\stick{\tsk and keeping his compasses still upon}
\stick{\i{Nevers} with one hand, and holding his}
\stick{book of the post-roads in the other\tsk}
\stick{half calculating and half listening, he}
\stick{leaned forwards upon the table with both}

\tsh \quad \tsh \quad And a chapter it\break

\stick{it may be some divine or father of the}
\stick{church, St.\@ \i{Austin}, or St.\@ \i{Cyprian}, or}
\stick{\i{Barnard}, who affirms that it is an irresis-}
\stick{table and natural passion to weep for the}
\stck{loss of our friends or children\tsk and \i{Seneca}}
\stick{(I’m positive) tells us somewhere, that}
\stick{such griefs evacuate themselves best by}
\stick{that particular channel.\tsk And accord-}
\stick{ingly we find, that \i{David} wept for his}
\stick{son \i{Absolom}\tsk \i{Adrian} for his \i{Antinous}\tsk}
\stick{\i{Niobe} for her children, and that \i{Apollo}-}
\stick{\i{dorus} and \i{Crito} both shed tears for \i{Socra}-}
\i{tes} before his death.

\tight{My father managed his affliction other}-\break
\stick{wise; and indeed differently from most}
\stick{men either ancient or modern; for he}
\stick{neither wept it away, as the \i{Hebrews} and}
\stick{the \i{Romans}\tsk or slept it off, as the \i{Lap}-}
\stick{\i{landers}\tsk or hang’d it, as the \i{English}, or}
\stick{drowned it, as the \i{Germans}\tsk nor did he}
\catch{curse}
\stick{curse it, or damn it, or excommunicate}
it, or rhyme it, or lillabullero it.\tsh

\tsh  He got rid of it, however.

Will your worships give me leave to\break
\tighter{squeeze in a story between these two pages?}

When \i{Tully} was bereft of his dear\break
\stick{daughter \i{Tullia}, at first he laid it to his}
\stick{heart,\tsk he listened to the voice of nature,}
\stick{and modulated his own unto it.\tsk O my}
\stick{\i{Tullia!} my daughter!  my child!\tsk still,}
\stick{still, still,\tsk ’twas O my \i{Tullia!}\tsh my}
\stick{\i{Tullia!} Methinks I see my \i{Tullia}, I}
\stick{hear my \i{Tullia}, I talk with my \i{Tullia}.\tsk}
\stick{But as soon as he began to look into the}
\stick{stores of philosophy, and consider how}
\stck{many excellent things might be said upon}
\stick{the occasion\tsk no body upon earth can}
\stick{conceive, says the great orator, how hap-}
py, how joyful it made me.

My father was as proud of his elo-\break
\stick{quence as \s{Marcus Tullius Cicero}}
\catch{could}
\stick{could be for his life, and for aught I am}
\stick{convinced of to the contrary at present,}
\stick{with as much reason: it was indeed his}
\stick{strength\tsk and his weakness too.\tsk His}
\stick{strength\tsk for he was by nature eloquent,}
\stick{\tsk and his weakness\tsk for he was hourly}
\stick{a dupe to it; and provided an occasion}
\stick{in life would but permit him to shew his}
\stick{talents, or say either a wise thing, a witty,}
\stick{or a shrewd one\tsk (bating the case of a}
\stick{systematick misfortune)\tsk he had all he}
\stick{wanted.\tsk A blessing which tied up my}
\stick{father’s tongue, and a misfortune which}
\stick{set it loose with a good grace, were pretty}
\stick{equal: sometimes, indeed, the misfor-}
\stick{tune was the better of the two; for in-}
\stck{stance, where the pleasure of the harangue}
\stick{was as \i{ten}, and the pain of the misfor-}
\stick{tune but as \i{five}\tsk my father gained half}
\stick{in half, and consequently was as well}
again off, as it never had befallen him.

This clue will unravel, what otherwise\break
\stick{would seem very inconsistent in my fa-}
\catch{ther’s}
\stick{ther’s domestick character; and it is this,}
\stick{that in the provocations arising from the}
\stick{neglects and blunders of servants, or o-}
\stick{ther mishaps unavoidable in a family, his}
\stick{anger, or rather the duration of it, eter-}
nally ran counter to all conjecture.

My father had a favourite little mare,\break
\stick{which he had consigned over to a most}
\stick{beautiful Arabian horse, in order to have}
\stick{a pad out of her for his own riding: he}
\stick{was sanguine in all his projects; so talk-}
\stick{ed about his pad every day with as abso-}
\stick{lute a security, as if it had been reared,}
\stick{broke,\tsk and bridled and saddled at his}
\stick{door ready for mounting. By some neg-}
\stick{lect or other in \i{Obadiah}, it so fell out,}
\stick{that my father’s expectations were an-}
\stick{swered with nothing better than a mule,}
\stick{and as ugly a beast of the kind as ever}
was produced.

My mother and my uncle \toby expect-\break
\stick{ed my father would be the death of \i{Oba}-}
\catch{\i{diah}}
\stick{\i{diah}\tsk and that there never would be an}
\stick{end of the disaster.\tsh See here! you}
\stick{rascal, cried my father, pointing to the}
\stick{mule, what you have done!\tsk It was not}
\stick{me, said \i{Obadiah}.\tsk How do I know}
that? replied my father.

Triumph swam in my father’s eyes, at\break
\stick{the repartee\tsk the \i{Attic} salt brought wa-}
\stick{ter into them\tsk and so \i{Obadiah} heard no}
more about it.

Now let us go back to my brother’s\break
death.

Philosophy has a fine saying for every\break
\stick{thing.\tsk For \i{Death} it has an entire set;}
\stick{the misery was, they all at once rushed}
\stick{into my father’s head, that ’twas difficult}

\stick{He had as little skill, honest man, in the}

\stick{trip across the \i{Archipelago} into \i{Asia}; and}
\stick{that all this sailing affair with \i{Ægina} be-}

\stick{had got possession of my mother’s green}

\stick{coolly, after the example of \i{Xenophon},}
\stick{and write a \s{Tristra}-\i{pœdia}\sic, or system}
\stick{of education for me; collecting first for}
\stick{that purpose his own scattered thoughts,}

\stick{together, so as to form an \s{institute} for}
\stck{the government of my childhood and ado-}

\setlength{\baselineskip}{12.32pt}%
\stick{lescence. I was my father’s last stake\tsk}
\stick{he had lost my brother \i{Bobby} entirely,\tsk}
\stick{he had lost, by his own computation,}
\stick{full three fourths of me\tsk that is, he had}
\stick{been unfortunate in his three first great}
\stick{casts for me\tsk my geniture, nose, and}
\stick{name,\tsk there was but this one left; and}
\stick{accordingly my father gave himself up}
\stick{to it with as much devotion as ever my}
\stick{uncle \toby had done to his doctrine of}
\stick{projectils.\tsk The difference between them}
\stick{was, that my uncle \toby drew his whole}
\stick{knowledge of projectils from \i{Nicholas}}
\stick{\i{Tartaglia}\tsk My father spun his, every}
\stick{thread of it, out of his own brain,\tsk or}
\stick{reeled and cross-twisted what all other}
\stick{spinners and spinsters had spun before}
\stick{him, that ’twas pretty near the same tor-}
ture to him.

In about three years, or something\break
\stick{more, my father had got advanced al-}
\stick{most into the middle of his work.\tsk Like}
\stick{all other writers, he met with disappoint-}
\catch{ments.}
\stick{ments.\tsk He imagined he should be}
\stick{able to bring whatever he had to say,}
\stick{into so small a compass, that when it}
\stick{was finished and bound, it might be}
\stick{rolled up in my mother’s hussive.\tsk Mat-}
\stick{ter grows under our hands.\tsk Let no man}
say,\tsk “Come\tsk I’ll write a \i{duodecimo}.”

My father gave himself up to it, how-\break
\stick{ever, with the most painful diligence,}
\stick{proceeding step by step in every line,}
\stick{with the same kind of caution and cir-}
\stick{cumspection (though I cannot say upon}
\stick{quite so religious a principle) as was used}
\stick{by \i{John de la Casse}, the lord archbishop}
\stick{of \i{Benevento}, in compassing his \i{Galatea};}
\stick{in which his Grace of \i{Benevento} spent}
\stick{near forty years of his life; and when}
\stick{the thing came out, it was not of above}
\stick{half the size or the thickness of a \i{Rider}’s}
\stick{Almanack.\tsk How the holy man mana-}
\stick{ged the affair, unless he spent the great-}
\stick{est part of his time in combing his whis-}
\catch{kers,}
\baselineskip 12.6667pt
\stick{kers, or playing at \i{primero} with his chap-}
\stick{lain,\tsk would pose any mortal not let into}
\stick{the true secret;\tsk and therefore ’tis worth}
\stick{explaining to the world, was it only for}
\stick{the encouragement of those few in it,}
\stick{who write not so much to be fed\tsk as to}
be famous.

I own had \i{John de la Casse}, the arch-\break
\stick{bishop of \i{Benevento}, for whose memory}
\stick{(notwithstanding his \i{Galatea)}\sic I retain}
\stick{the highest veneration,\tsk had he been,}
\stick{Sir, a slender clerk\tsk of dull wit\tsk slow}
\stick{parts\tsk costive head, and so forth,\tsk he}
\stick{and his \i{Galatea} might have jogged on}
\stick{together to the age of \i{Methuselah} for}
\stick{me,\tsk the phænomenon had not been}
worth a parenthesis.\tsk

But the reverse of this was the truth:\break
\stick{\i{John de la Casse} was a genius of fine parts}
\stick{and fertile fancy; and yet with all these}
\stick{great advantages of nature, which should}
\catch{have}
\stick{have pricked him forwards with his \i{Ga}-}
\stick{\i{latea}, he lay under an impuissance at the}
\stick{same time of advancing above a line and}
\stick{a half in the compass of a whole sum-}
\stick{mer’s day: this disability in his Grace}
\stick{arose from an opinion he was afflicted}
\stick{with,\tsk which opinion was this,\tsk \i{viz}.\@ that}
\stick{whenever a Christian was writing a book}
\stick{(not for his private amusement, but)}
\stick{where his intent and purpose was \i{bonâ}}
\stick{\i{fide}, to print and publish it to the world,}
\stick{his first thoughts were always the temp-}
\stick{tations of the evil one.\tsk This was the}
\stick{state of ordinary writers: but when a}
\stick{personage of venerable character and}
\stick{high station, either in church or state,}
\stick{once turned author,\tsk he maintained,}
\stick{that from the very moment he took pen}
\stick{in hand\tsk all the devils in hell broke out}
\stick{of their holes to cajole him.\tsk ’Twas}
\stick{Term-time with them,\tsk every thought,}
\stick{first and last, was captious;\tsk how spe-}
\catch{cious}
\stick{cious and good soever,\tsk ’twas all one;}
\stick{\tsk in whatever form or colour it present-}
\stick{ed itself to the imagination,\tsk ’twas still}
\stick{a stroke of one or other of ’em levelled}
\stick{at him, and was to be fenced off.\tsk So}
\stick{that the life of a writer, whatever he}
\stick{might fancy to the contrary, was not so}
\stick{much a state of \i{composition}, as a state of}
\stick{\i{warfare}; and his probation in it, precisely}
\stick{that of any other man militant upon}
\stick{earth,\tsk both depending alike, not half}
\stick{so much upon the degrees of his \s{wit}\tsk}
as his \s{resistance}.

My father was hugely pleased with\break
\stick{this theory of \i{John de la Casse}, archbi-}
\stick{shop of \i{Benevento;} and (had it not}
\stick{cramped him a little in his creed) I be-}
\stick{lieve would have given ten of the best}
\stick{acres in the \i{Shandy} estate, to have been}
\stick{the broacher of it.\tsk How far my father}
\stick{actually believed in the devil, will be}
\stick{seen, when I come to speak of my fa-}
\catch{ther’s}
\stick{ther’s religious notions, in the progress}
\stick{of this work: ’tis enough to say here,}
\stick{as he could not have the honour of it,}
\stick{in the literal sense of the doctrine\tsk he}
\stick{took up with the allegory of it;\tsk and}
\stick{would often say, especially when his pen}
\stick{was a little retrograde, there was as much}
\stick{good meaning, truth, and knowledge,}
\stick{couched under the veil of \i{John de la}}
\stick{\i{Casse}’s parabolical representation,\tsk as}
\stick{was to be found in any one poetic fiction,}
\stick{or mystick record of antiquity.\tsk Preju-}
\stick{dice of education, he would say, \i{is the}}
\stick{\i{devil},\tsk and the multitudes of them which}
\stick{we suck in with our mother’s milk\tsk \i{are}}
\stick{\i{the devil and all}.\tsk We are haunted}
\stick{with them, brother \toby, in all our lucu-}
\stick{brations and researches; and was a man}
\stick{fool enough to submit tamely to what}
\stick{they obtruded upon him,\tsk what would}
\stick{his book be?  Nothing,\tsk he would add,}
\stick{throwing his pen away with a vengeance,}
\stick{\tsk nothing but a farrago of the clack of}
\catch{nurses,}
\parskip 12pt
\stick{nurses, and of the nonsense of the old}
\stick{women (of both sexes) throughout the}
kingdom.

This is the best account I am deter-\break
\stick{mined to give of the slow progress my}
\stck{father made in his \i{Tristra-pædia;} at which}
\stick{(as I said) he was three years and some-}
\stick{thing more, indefatigably at work, and}
\stick{at last, had scarce compleated, by his}
\stick{own reckoning, one half of his under-}
\stick{taking: the misfortune was, that I was}
\stick{all that time totally neglected and aban-}
\stick{doned to my mother; and what was al-}
\stick{most as bad, by the very delay, the first}
\stick{part of the work, upon which my father}
\stick{had spent the most of his pains, was ren-}
\stick{dered entirely useless,\tsh every day a}
\stick{page or two became of no conse-}
quence.\tsh

\tsh Certainly it was ordained as a\break
\stick{scourge upon the pride of human wis-}
\catch{dom,}
\stick{dom, That the wisest of us all, should}
\stick{thus outwit ourselves, and eternally fore-}
\stick{go our purposes in the intemperate act}
of pursuing them.

In short, my father was so long in all\break
\stick{his acts of resistance,\tsk or in other words,}
\stick{\tsk he advanced so very slow with his}
\stick{work, and I began to live and get for-}
\stick{wards at such a rate, that if an event}
\stick{had not happened,\tsk which, when we}
\stick{get to it, if it can be told with decency,}
\stick{shall not be concealed a moment from}
\stick{the reader\tsk I verily believe, I had}
\stick{put by my father, and left him drawing}
\stick{a sun-dial, for no better purpose than to}
be buried under ground.

\stick{pullies, when the lead was gone, were}
\stick{of no kind of use, he had taken them}
\stick{away also, to make a couple of wheels}
for one of their carriages.

\tight{He had dismantled every sash window}\break

\stick{the very same way,\tsk though not always}

\stick{I have but two reasons for thinking}
otherwise.

First, Had the matter been taken into\break

\stick{my father certainly would have nailed up}
\stick{the sash-window for good an’ all;\tsk}
\stick{which, considering with what difficulty}

\stick{writing the chapter, even after the event;}
\catch{but}
\stick{but ’tis obviated under the second reason,}
\stick{which I have the honour to offer to the}
\stick{world in support of my opinion, that my}
\stick{father did not write the chapter upon}
\stick{sash-windows and chamber-pots, at the}
time supposed,\tsk and it is this.

\tsh  That, in order to render the \i{Tris}-\break

\stick{\lqq back turned towards his horse’s head,}
\stick{\lqq \tsk Now (said he) my case goes forward.}
\stick{\lqq Then suddenly in the same posture}

This being the state of the case; the\break
\stick{road to Longevity was plain; nothing}
\stick{more being required, says his lordship,}
\catch{but}
\stick{but to repair the waste committed by the}
\stick{internal spirit, by making the substance}
\stick{of it more thick and dense, by a regu-}
\stick{lar course of opiates on one side, and by}
\stick{refrigerating the heat of it on the other,}
\stick{by three grains and a half of salt-petre}
every morning before you got up.\tsh

Still this frame of ours was left ex-\break
\stick{posed to the inimical assaults of the air}
\stick{without;\tsk but this was fenced off again}
\stick{by a course of greasy unctions, which}
\stick{so fully saturated the pores of the skin,}
\stick{that no spicula could enter;\tsk nor}
\stick{could any one get out.\tsk This put a}
\stck{stop to all perspiration, sensible and insen-}

\dropcap{T}{he} whole secret of health, said\break
my father, beginning the sentence\break
\stick{again, depending evidently upon the due}
\stick{contention betwixt the radical heat and}
\stick{radical moisture within us;\tsk the least}
\stick{imaginable skill had been sufficient to}
\stick{have maintained it, had not the school-}
\stick{men confounded the task, merely (as}
\stick{\i{Van Helmont}, the famous chymist, has}
\stick{proved) by all along mistaking the ra-}
\stick{dical moisture for the tallow and fat of}
animal bodies.

Now the radical moisture is not the\break
\stick{tallow or fat of animals, but an oily and}
\stick{balsamous substance; for the fat and}
\stick{tallow, as also the phlegm or watery}
\catch{parts,}
\stick{parts, are cold; whereas the oily and bal-}
\stick{samous parts are of a lively heat and spi-}
\stick{rit, which accounts for the observation}
\stick{of \i{Aristotle}, \lqq\i{Quod omne animal post}}
\lqq \i{coitum est} triste.”

Now it is certain, that the radical heat\break
\stick{lives in the radical moisture, but whether}
\stick{\i{vice versâ}, is a doubt: however, when}
\stick{the one decays, the other decays also;}
\stick{and then is produced, either an unnatu-}
\stick{ral heat, which causes an unnatural dry-}
\stick{ness\tsh or an unnatural moisture, which}
\stick{causes dropsies.\tsh So that if a child, as}
\stick{he grows up, can but be taught to avoid}
\stick{running into fire or water, as either of}
\stick{’em threaten his destruction,\tsh ’twill}
\stick{be all that is needful to be done upon}
that head.\tsh

\stick{and the corporal, that we had all along}
\stick{a burning fever, attended with a most}

\catch{due}
\stick{due contention betwixt the radical heat}
\stick{and the radical moisture, by reinforce-}
\stick{ing the fever, as he did all along, with}
\stick{hot wine and spices; whereby the cor-}

\dropcap[ante=\tsh]{F}{ive} years with a bib under\break
his chin;

Four years in travelling from Christ-\break
cross-row to \i{Malachi};

A year and a half in learning to write\break
his own name;

Seven long years and more \g{τυπτω}-ing\break
it, at Greek and Latin;

Four years at his \i{probations} and his\break
\stick{\i{negations}\tsk the fine statue still lying in}
\catch{the}
\stick{the middle of the marble block,\tsk and}
\stick{nothing done, but his tools sharpened to}
\stick{hew it out!\tsk ’Tis a piteous delay!\tsk}
\stick{Was not the great \i{Julius Scaliger} with-}
\stick{in an ace of never getting his tools}
\stick{sharpened at all?\tsh Forty-four years}
\stick{old was he before he could manage his}
\stick{Greek;\tsk and \i{Peter Damianus}, lord bi-}
\stick{shop of \i{Ostia},\quad as all the world knows,}
\stick{could not so much as read, when he}
\stick{was of man’s estate.\tsk And \i{Baldus} him-}
\stick{self, as eminent as he turned out after,}
\stick{entered upon the law so late in life, that}
\stick{every body imagined he intended to be}
\stick{an advocate in the other world: no}
\stick{wonder, when \i{Eudamidas}, the son of}
\stick{\i{Archidamas}, heard \i{Xenocrates} at seventy-}
\stick{five disputing about \i{wisdom}, that he}
\stick{asked gravely,\tsk \i{If the old man be yet}}
\stick{\i{disputing and enquiring concerning wisdom},}
\catch{\i{\tsk what}}
\parskip 10pt
\stick{\i{\tsk what time will he have to make use of}}
\i{it?}

\i{Yorick} listened to my father with great\break
\stick{attention; there was a seasoning of wis-}
\stick{dom unaccountably mixed up with his}
\stick{strangest whims, and he had sometimes}
\stick{such illuminations in the darkest of his}
\stick{eclipses, as almost attoned for them:\tsk}
be wary, Sir, when you imitate him.

I am convinced, \i{Yorick}, continued\break
\stick{my father, half reading and half dis-}
\stick{coursing, that there is a North west pas-}
\stick{sage to the intellectual world; and that}
\stick{the soul of man has shorter ways of go-}
\stick{ing to work, in furnishing itself with}
\stick{knowledge and instruction, than we ge-}
\stick{nerally take with it.\tsh But alack! all}
\stick{fields have not a river or a spring running}
\catch{be-}
\stick{besides them;\tsk every child, \i{Yorick!} has}
not a parent to point it out.

\tsh The whole entirely depends, add-\break
\stick{ed my father, in a low voice, upon the}
\i{auxiliary verbs}, Mr.\@ \i{Yorick}.

Had \i{Yorick} trod upon \i{Virgil}\kern 0.5pt’s snake,\break
\stick{he could not have looked more surprised.}
\stick{\tsk I am surprised too, cried my father,}
\stick{observing it,\tsk and I reckon it as one of}
\stick{the greatest calamities which ever befell}
\stick{the republick of letters, That those who}
\stick{have been entrusted with the education}
\stick{of our children, and whose business it}
\stick{was to open their minds, and stock them}
\stick{early with ideas, in order to set the ima-}
\stick{gination loose upon them, have made so}
\stick{little use of the auxiliary verbs in doing}
\stick{it, as they have done\tsk So that, ex-}
\catch{cept}
\parskip 12pt
\stick{cept \i{Raymond Lullius}, and the elder \i{Pe}-}
\stick{\i{legrini}, the last of which arrived to such}
\stick{perfection in the use of ’em, with his to-}
\stick{pics, that in a few lessons, he could}
\stick{teach a young gentleman to discourse}
\stick{with plausibility upon any subject, \i{pro}}
\stick{and \i{con}, and to say and write all that}
\stick{could be spoken or written concerning it,}
\stick{without blotting a word, to the admi-}
\stick{ration of all who beheld him.\tsk I should}
\stick{be glad, said \i{Yorick}, interrupting my}
\stick{father, to be made to comprehend this}
matter. You shall, said my father.

The highest stretch of improvement a\break
\stick{single word is capable of, is a high me-}
\stick{taphor,\tsk for which, in my opinion,}
\stick{the idea is generally the worse, and not}
\stick{the better;\tsk but be that as it may,}
\catch{\tsk when}
\stick{\tsk when the mind has done that with it}
\stick{\tsk there is an end,\tsk the mind and the}
\stick{idea are at rest,\tsk until a second idea en-}
ters;\tsh and so on.

Now the use of the \i{Auxiliaries} is, at\break
\stick{once to set the soul a going by herself}
\stick{upon the materials as they are brought}
\stick{her; and by the versability of this great}
\stick{engine, round which they are twisted,}
\stick{to open new tracks of enquiry, and make}
every idea engender millions.

You excite my curiosity greatly, said\break
\i{Yorick}.

For my own part, quoth my uncle\break
\stick{\toby, I have given it up.\tsh The \i{Danes},}
\stick{an’ please your honour, quoth the cor-}
\catch{poral,}
\stick{poral, who were on the left at the siege}
\stick{of \i{Limerick}, were all auxiliaries.\tsh And}
\stick{very good ones, said my uncle \toby.\tsk}
\stick{But the auxiliaries, \trim, my brother}
\stick{is talking about,\tsk I conceive to be diffe-}
rent things.\tsh

\tsk Yo\sic do? said my father, rising\break
up.

\chap{XLIII}{18pt}{6pt}

\dropcap{M}{y} father took a single turn across\break
the room, then sat down and fi-\break
nished the chapter.

The verbs auxiliary we are concerned\break
in here, continued my father, are, \i{am};
\stck{\i{was}; \i{have}; \i{had}; \i{do}; \i{did}; \i{make}; \i{made}; \i{suf-}}
\catch{\i{fer};}
\stck{\i{fer}; \i{shall}; \i{should}; \i{will}; \i{would}; \i{can}; \i{could};}
\stick{\i{owe}; \i{ought}; \i{used}; or \i{is wont}.\tsk And these}
\stck{varied with tenses, \i{present}, \i{past}, \i{future}, and}
\stick{conjugated with the verb \i{see},\tsk or with}
\stick{these questions added to them;\tsk \i{Is it?}}
\stick{\i{Was it? Will it be? Would it be? May}}
\stick{\i{it be? Might it be?} And these again}
\stick{put negatively, \i{Is it not? Was it not?}}
\stick{\i{Ought it not?}\tsk Or affirmatively,\tsk \i{It is};}
\stick{\i{It was}; \i{It ought to be}. Or chronologi-}
\stick{cally,\tsk \i{Has it been always? Lately?}}
\stick{\i{How long ago?}\tsk Or hypothetically,\tsk \i{If}}
\stick{\i{it was}; \i{If it was not?} What would}
\stick{follow?\tsk If the \i{French} should beat}
\stick{the \i{English?} If the \i{Sun} go out of the}
\i{Zodiac?}

Now, by the right use and application\break
\stick{of these, continued my father, in which}
\catch{a}
\stick{a child’s memory should be exercised,}
\stick{there is no one idea can enter his brain}
\stick{how barren soever, but a magazine of}
\stick{conceptions and conclusions may be}
\stick{drawn forth from it.\tsk Did’st thou e-}
\stick{ver see a white bear? cried my father,}
\stick{turning his head round to \trim, who}
\stick{stood at the back of his chair:\tsk No,}
\stick{an’ please your honour, replied the cor-}
\stick{poral.\tsk But thou could’st discourse}
\stick{about one, \trim, said my father, in}
\stick{case of need?\tsk How is it possible,}
\stick{brother, quoth my uncle \toby, if the}
\stick{corporal never saw one?\tsk ’Tis the}
\stick{fact I want; replied my father,\tsk and}
the possibility of it, is as follows.

A \s{white bear}! Very well.  Have\break
\stick{I ever seen one? Might I ever have seen}
\parskip 14pt
\catch{one?}
\stick{one? Am I ever to see one? Ought}
\stick{I ever to have seen one? Or can I ever}
see one?

Would I had seen a white bear? (for\break
how can I imagine it?)

If I should see a white bear, what\break
\stick{should I say? If I should never see a}
white bear, what then?

If I never have, can, must, or shall\break
\stick{see a white bear alive; have I ever seen}
\stick{the skin of one? Did I ever see one}
\stick{painted?\tsk described? Have I never}
dreamed of one?

Did my father, mother, uncle, aunt,\break
\stick{brothers or sisters, ever see a white bear?}
\catch{What}
\stick{What would they give? How would}
\stick{they behave? How would the white}
\stick{bear have behaved? Is he wild?}
\stick{Tame? Terrible? Rough? Smooth?}

\tsk Is the white bear worth seeing?\tsk

\tsk Is there no sin in it?\tsk

Is it better than a \s{black one}?
