\dropcap{W}{hat} the old French officer\break
had deliver’d upon travel-\break
\stick{ling, bringing Polonius’s advice to}
\stck{his son upon the same subject into my}
\stick{head\tskk and that bringing in Hamlet;}
\stick{and Hamlet, the rest of Shakespear’s}
\stick{works, I stopp’d at the Quai de}
\stick{Conti in my return home, to pur-}
chase the whole set.


\patchv[\baselineskip]{B}{The}

The bookseller said he had not a\break
\stick{set in the world\tskk\i{Comment!} said I;}
\stick{taking one up out of a set which lay}
\stick{upon the counter betwixt us.\tsh He}
\stick{said, they were sent him only to be}
\stick{got bound, and were to be sent back}
\stick{to Versailles in the morning to the}
Count de B\anon.

\tskk And does the Count de B\anon\break
\stick{said I, read Shakespear?  \i{C’est un}}
\stick{\i{Esprit fort}; replied the bookseller.\tskk}
\stick{He loves English books; and what}
\stick{is more to his honour, Monsieur,}
\stick{he love the English too.  You speak}
\stick{this so civilly, said I, that ’tis enough}
\stick{to oblige an Englishman to lay out a}
\stick{Louis d’or or two at your shop\tskk the}
\stick{bookseller made a bow, and was}
\catch{going}
\stck{going to say something, when a young}
\stick{decent girl of about twenty, who by}
\stick{her air and dress, seemed to be \i{fille}}
\stick{\i{de chambre} to some devout woman of}
\stck{fashion, came into the shop and asked}
\stick{for \i{Les Egarments du Cœur \et\ de l’Es}-}
\stick{\i{prit:} the bookseller gave her the book}
\stick{directly; she pulled out a little green}
\stick{sattin purse run round with a ribband}
\stick{of the same colour, and putting her}
\stick{finger and thumb into it, she took out}
\stck{the money, and paid for it. As I had no-}
\stick{thing more to stay me in the shop, we}
both walked out at the door together.

\tsk And what have you to do,\break
\stick{my dear, said I, with \i{The Wanderings}}
\stick{\i{of the Heart}, who scarce know yet}
\stick{you have one? nor till love has}
\catchs{B 2}{first}
\stick{first told you it, or some faithless}
\stck{shepherd has made it ache, can’st thou}
\stick{ever be sure it is so.\tskk \i{Le Dieu m’en}}
\stick{\i{guard!} said the girl.\tskk With reason,}
\stick{said I\tsk for if\sic is a good one, ’tis pity}
\stick{it should be stolen: ’tis a little trea-}
\stick{sure to thee, and gives a better air}
\stick{to your face, than if it was dress’d}
out with pearls.

The young girl listened with a\break
\stick{submissive attention, holding her sat-}
\stick{tin purse by its ribband in her hand}
\stick{all the time\tskk ’Tis a very small one,}
\stick{said I, taking hold of the bottom of}
\stick{it\tskk she held it towards me\tskk and}
\stick{there is very little in it, my dear, said}
\stick{I; but be but as good as thou art hand-}
\stick{some, and heaven will fill it:  I had a}
\catch{parcel}
\stick{parcel of crowns in my hand to pay}
\stick{for Shakespear; and, as she had let go}
\stick{the purse intirely, I put a single one}
\stick{in; and tying up the ribband in a}
bow-knot, returned it to her.

The young girl made me more a\break
\stick{humble courtesy than a low one\tskk}
\stick{’twas one of those quiet, thankful}
\stick{sinkings where the spirit bows itself}
\stick{down\tskk the body does no more than}
\stick{tell it.  I never gave a girl a crown}
\stick{in my life which gave me half the}
pleasure.

My advice, my dear, would not\break
\stick{have been worth a pin to you, said}
\stick{I, if I had not given this along with}
\stick{it: but now, when you see the crown,}
\catchs{B 3}{you’ll}
\stick{you’ll remember it\tskk so don’t, my}
dear, lay it out in ribbands.

Upon my word, Sir, said the\break
\stick{girl, earnestly, I am incapable\tskk in}
\stick{saying which, as is usual in little bar-}
\stick{gains of honour, she gave me her}
\stick{hand\tskk \i{En verite}, \i{Monsieur}, \i{je met}-}
\i{trai cet argent apart}, said she.

When a virtuous convention is\break
\stick{made betwixt man and woman, it}
\stick{sanctifies their most private walks:}
\stick{so notwithstanding it was dusky, yet}
\stick{as both our roads lay the same way,}
\stick{we made no scruple of walking along}
the Quai de Conti together.

\patch[\baselineskip]{She}

She made me a second courtesy in\break
\stick{setting off, and before we got twenty}
\stick{yards from the door, as if she had}
\stick{not done enough before, she made a}
\stick{sort of a little stop to tell me again,}
\tskk she thank’d me.

It was a small tribute, I told her,\break
\stick{which I could not avoid paying to}
\stick{virtue, and would not be mistaken in}
\stick{the person I had been rendering it to}
\stick{for the world\tskk but I see innocence,}
\stick{my dear, in your face\tskk and foul be-}
\stick{fall the man who ever lays a snare in}
its way!

The girl seem’d affected some way\break
\stick{or other with what I said\tskk she gave}
\stick{a low sigh\tskk I found I was not im-}
\catchs{B 4}{powered}
\stick{powered to enquire at all after it\tskk so}
\stick{said nothing more till I got to the}
\stck{corner of the Rue de Nevers, where we}
were to part.

\tskk\tighter{But is this the way, my dear, said I,}\break
\stck{to the hotel de Modene?  she told me it}
\stick{was\tskk or, that I might go by the Rue}
\stick{de Guineygaude, which was the next}
\stick{turn.\tskk Then I’ll go, my dear, by the}
\stick{Rue de Guineygaude, said I, for two}
\stck{reasons; first I shall please myself, and}
\stick{next I shall give you the protection of}
\stick{my company as far on your way as I}
\stick{can.  The girl was sensible I was civil}
\stick{\tskk and said, she wish’d the hotel de}
\stick{Modene was in the Rue de St.\@ Pierre\tsk}
\stick{\tskk You live there? said I.\tskk She told}
\stck{me she was \i{fille de chambre} to Madame}
\catch{R\anon}
\stick{\i{R}\anon\sic\tskk Good God!\@ said I, ’tis the}
\stick{very lady for whom I have brought a}
\stck{letter from Amiens\tskk The girl told me}
\stick{that Madame \i{R}\anon\sic, she believed}
\stick{expected a stranger with a letter, and}
\stk{was impatient to see him\tskk so I desired}
\stick{the girl to present my compliments to}
\stck{Madame R\anon, and say I would cer-}
tainly wait upon her in the morning.

\tighter{We stood still at the corner of the Rue}\break
\stk{de Nevers whilst this pass’d\tskk We then}
\stick{stopp’d a moment whilst she disposed}
\stick{of her \i{Egarments de\sic Cœur}, \&c. more}
\stick{commodiously than carrying them in}
\stick{her hand\tskk they were two volumes;}
\stick{so I held the second for her whilst she}
\stick{put the first into her pocket; and then}
\catch{she}
\stick{she held her pocket, and I put in the}
other after it.

\tight{’Tis sweet to feel by what fine-spun}\break
\stick{threads our affections are drawn to-}
gether.

We set off a-fresh, and as she took\break
\stick{her third step, the girl put her hand}
\stick{within my arm\tskk I was just bidding}
\stick{her\tskk but she did it of herself with}
\stick{that undeliberating simplicity, which}
\stick{shew’d it was out of her head that}
\stick{she had never seen me before.  For}
\stick{my own part, I felt the conviction of}
\stck{consanguinity so strongly, that I could}
\stick{not help turning half round to look in}
\stick{her face, and see if I could trace out}
\catch{any}
\stick{any  thing in it of a family likeness\tsk}
Tut! said I, are we not all relations?

When we arrived at the turning up\break
\stick{of the Rue de Guineygaude, I stopp’d}
\stick{to bid her adieu for good an all: the}
\stick{girl would thank me again for my}
\stick{company and kindness\tskk She bid me}
\stick{adieu twice\tskk I repeated it as often;}
\stck{and so cordial was the parting between}
\stick{us, that had it happen’d any where}
\stick{else, I’m not sure but I should have}
\stick{signed it with a kiss of charity, as}
warm and holy as an apostle.

\tight{But in Paris, as none kiss each other}\break
\stick{but the men\tskk I did, what amounted}
to the same thing\tsh

\tsh I bid God bless her.

\dropcap{W}{hen} I got home to my\break
hotel, La Fleur told me I\break
\stick{had been enquired after by the Lieu-}
\stick{tenant de Police\tskk The duce take it!}
\stick{said I\tskk\!\tskk I know the reason.  It is}
\stick{time the reader should know it, for}
\stick{in the order of things in which it}
\stick{happened, it was omitted; not that}
\stick{it was out of my head; but that had}
\stick{I told it then, it might have been}
\stick{forgot now\tskk and now is the time I}
want it.

I had left London with so much\break
\stick{precipitation, that it never enter’d my}
\catch{mind}
\stck{mind that we were at war with France;}
\stick{and had reach’d Dover, and look’d}
\stick{through my glass at the hills beyond}
\stick{Boulogne, before the idea presented}
\stick{itself; and with this in its train, that}
\stick{there was no getting there without a}
\stick{passport.  Go but to the end of a}
\stick{street, I have a mortal aversion for}
\stick{returning back no wiser than I sat\sic}
\stick{out; and as this was one of the great-}
\stick{est efforts I had ever made for know-}
\stick{ledge, I could less bear the thoughts}
\stick{of it: so hearing the Count de\anon}
\stick{had hired the packet, I begg’d he}
\stick{would take me in his \i{suite}.  The}
\stick{Count had some little knowledge of}
\stick{me, so made little or no difficulty\tskk}
\stick{only said, his inclination to serve me}
\stick{could reach no farther than Calais;}
\catch{as}
\stck{as he was to return by way of Brussels}
\stick{to Paris: however, when I had once}
\stick{pass’d there, I might get to Paris}
\stick{without interruption; but that in}
\stick{Paris I must make friends and shift}
\stick{for myself.\tskk Let me get to Paris,}
\stick{Monsieur le Count, said I\tskk and I}
\stick{shall do very well.  So I embark’d,}
\stick{and never thought more of the}
matter.

When La Fleur told me the Lieu-\break
\stick{tenant de Police had been enquiring}
\stck{after me\tskk the thing instantly recurred}
\stick{\tskk and by the time La Fleur had well}
\stick{told me, the master of the hotel}
\stick{came into my room to tell me the}
\stick{same thing, with this addition to it,}
\stick{that my passport had been particu-}
\catch{larly}
\stick{larly ask’d after: the master of the}
\stick{hotel concluded with saying, He}
\stick{hoped I had one.\tskk Not I, faith!}
said I.

The master of the hotel retired\break
\stick{three steps from me, as from an in-}
\stick{fected person, as I declared this\tsk and}
\stick{poor La Fleur advanced three steps}
\stick{towards me, and with that sort of}
\stick{movement which a good soul makes}
\stck{to succour a distress’d one\tsk the fellow}
\stick{won my heart by it; and from that}
\stick{single \i{trait}, I knew his character as}
\stick{perfectly, and could rely upon it as}
\stick{firmly, as if he had served me with}
fidelity for seven years.

\patch[\baselineskip]{Mon}

Mon seignior! cried the master of\break
\stick{the hotel\tsk but recollecting himself}
\stick{as he made the exclamation, he in-}
\stick{stantly changed the tone of it\tskk If}
\stick{Monsieur, said he, has not a passport}
\stick{(\i{apparament}) in all likelihood he has}
\stick{friends in Paris who can procure him}
\stick{one.\tskk Not that I know of, quoth I,}
\stick{with an air of indifference.\tskk Then}
\stick{\i{certes}, replied he, you’ll be sent to the}
\stck{Bastile or the Chatelet, \i{au moins}. Poo!}
\stick{said I, the King of France is a good na-}
\stck{tured soul\tskk he’ll hurt no body.\tskk \i{Cela}}
\stick{\i{n’empeche pas}, said he\tskk you will cer-}
\stck{tainly be sent to the Bastile to-morrow}
\stick{morning.\tskk But I’ve taken your lodg-}
\stick{ings for a month, answer’d I, and I’ll}
\stick{not quit them a day before the time}
\stick{for all the kings of France in the}
\catch{world.}
\stick{world.  La Fleur whisper’d in my}
\stick{ear, That no body could oppose the}
king of France.

\i{Pardi!} said my host, \i{ces Messieurs}\break

\initial[nindent=1pt]{I}{COULD} not find in my heart\break
to torture La Fleur’s with a se-\break
\stick{rious look upon the subject of my}
\stick{embarrassment, which was the rea-}
\stick{son I had treated it so cavalierly: and}
\stick{to shew him how light it lay upon}
\stick{my mind, I dropt the subject en-}
\stick{tirely; and whilst he waited upon me}
\stick{at supper, talk’d to him with more}
\stick{than usual gaiety about Paris, and of}
\stick{the opera comique.\tskk La Fleur had}
\stick{been there himself, and had followed}
\stick{me through the streets as far as the}
\stck{bookseller’s shop; but seeing me come}
\catch{out}
\stick{out with the young \i{fille de chambre},}
\stick{and that we walk’d down the Quai de}
\stick{Conti together, La Fleur deem’d it}
\stick{unnecessary to follow me a step fur-}
\stick{ther\tskk so making his own reflections}
\stick{upon it, he took a shorter cut\tsh}
\stick{and got to the hotel in time to be in-}
\stick{form’d of the affair of the Police}
against my arrival.

As soon as the honest creature had\break
\stick{taken away, and gone down to sup}
\stick{himself, I then began to think a}
little seriously about my situation.\tskk

\tskk And here, I know, Eugenius,\break
\stick{thou wilt smile at the remembrance}
\stick{of a short dialogue which pass’d be-}
\catchs{C 2}{twixt}
\stick{twixt us the moment I was going to}
set out\tsh I must tell it here.

Eugenius, knowing that I was as\break
\stick{little subject to be overburthen’d with}
\stick{money as thought, had drawn me}
\stick{aside to interrogate me how much I}
\stick{had taken care for; upon telling him}
\stick{the exact sum, Eugenius shook his}
\stick{head, and said it would not do; so}
\stick{pull’d out his purse in order to empty}
\stick{it into mine.\tskk I’ve enough in con-}
\stick{science, Eugenius, said I.\tsh Indeed,}
\stick{Yorick, you have not, replied Eu-}
\stick{genius\tskk I know France and Italy}
\stick{better than you.\tsh But you don’t}
\stick{consider, Eugenius, said I, refusing}
\stick{his offer, that before I have been}
\stick{three days in Paris, I shall take care}
\catch{to}
\stick{to say or do something or other for}
\stick{which I shall get clapp’d up into the}
\stick{Bastile, and that I shall live there a}
\stick{couple of months entirely at the king}
\stick{of France’s expense.\tskk I beg pardon,}
\stick{said Eugenius, drily: really, I had}
forgot that resource.

Now the event I treated gaily\break
came seriously to my door.

Is it folly, or nonchalance, or phi-\break
\stick{losophy, or pertinacity\tskk or what is}
\stick{it in me, that, after all, when La}
\stick{Fleur had gone down stairs, and I}
\stick{was quite alone, that I could not}
\stick{bring down my mind to think of it}
\stick{otherwise than I had then spoken of}
it to Eugenius?

\patchs{C 3}{\tsk And}


\tskk And as for the Bastile! the ter-\break
\stick{ror is in the word\tskk Make the most}
\stick{of it you can, said I to myself, the}
\stick{Bastile is but another word for a}
\stick{tower\tskk and a tower is but another}
\stick{word for a house you can’t get out of}
\stick{\tskk Mercy on the gouty!  for they are}
\stick{in it twice a year\tskk But with nine}
\stick{livres a day, and pen and ink and}
\stick{paper and patience, albeit a man can’t}
\stick{get out, he may do very well within}
\stck{\tskk at least for a month or six weeks; at}
\stick{the end of which, if he is a harmless}
\stick{fellow his innocence appears, and}
\stick{he comes out a better and wiser man}
than he went in.

I had some occasion (I forget what)\break
\stick{to step into the court-yard, as I settled}
\catch{this}
\stick{this account; and remember I walk’d}
\stick{down stairs in no small triumph with}
\stick{the conceit of my reasoning.\tskk Be-}
\stck{shrew the \i{sombre} pencil! said I vaunt-}
\stick{ingly\tskk for I envy not its powers,}
\stick{which paints the evils of life with so}
\stick{hard and deadly a colouring.  The}
\stick{mind sits terrified at the objects she}
\stck{has magnified herself, and blackened:}
\stick{reduce them to their proper size and}
\stick{hue she overlooks them\tskk ’Tis true,}
\stick{said I, correcting the proposition\tskk}
\stick{the Bastile is not an evil to be de-}

\stk{up the fossè\tskk unbarricade the doors\tskk}

\stick{and not of a man which holds you in}
\catchs{C 4}{it\tskk}
\stick{it\tskk the evil vanishes, and you bear}
the other half without complaint.

I was interrupted in the hey-day\break
\stick{of this soliloquy, with a voice which}
\stick{I took to be of a child, which com-}
\stick{plained \lqq it could not get out.\rqq \tskk I}
\stick{look’d up and down the passage, and}
\stick{seeing neither man, woman, or child,}
I went out without farther attention.

In my return back through the\break
\stick{passage, I heard the same words re-}
\stick{peated twice over; and looking up,}
\stick{I saw it was a starling hung in a little}
\stick{cage.\tskk \lqq I can’t get out\tskk I can’t get}
\lqq out,\rqq\ said the starling.

\patch[\baselineskip]{I stood}

I stood looking at the bird: and\break
\stck{to every person who came through the}
\stick{passage it ran fluttering to the side to-}
\stick{wards which they approach’d it, with}
\stk{the same lamentation of its captivity\tskk}
\stick{\lqq I can’t get out\rqq, said the starling\tskk}
\stick{God help thee! said I, but I’ll let}
\stick{thee out, cost what it will; so I turn’d}

\stck{was twisted and double twisted so fast}
\stick{with wire, there was no getting it}
\stick{open without pulling the cage to}
pieces\tskk I took both hands to it.

The bird flew to the place where\break

\stick{said the starling\tskk \lqq I can’t get out}
\stick{\lqq\tskk I can’t get out,\rqq\ said the star-}
ling.

I vow, I never had my affections\break
\stick{more tenderly awakened; or do I re-}

\stick{the dissipated spirits, to which my}

\dropcap{T}{he} bird in his cage pursued\break
me into my room; I sat down\break
\stick{close to my table, and leaning my}
\stick{head upon my hand, I began to}
\stick{figure to myself the miseries of con-}
\stick{finement.  I was in a right frame}
\stick{for it, and so I gave full scope to my}
imagination.

I was going to begin with the\break
\stick{millions of my fellow creatures born}
\stick{to no inheritance but slavery; but}
\stick{finding, however affecting the pic-}
\stick{ture was, that I could not bring it}
\catch{near}
\stick{near me, and that the multitude of}
\stick{of\sic sad groups in it did but distract}
me.\tskk

\tskk I took a single captive, and hav-\break
\stick{ing first shut him up in his dungeon,}
\stick{I then look’d through the twilight of}
his grated door to take his picture.

I beheld his body half wasted away\break
\stick{with long expectation and confine-}
\stck{ment, and felt what kind of sickness of}

\tsk But here my heart began to bleed\break
\stick{\tskk and I was forced to go on with}
another part of the portrait.

He was sitting upon the ground\break
\stick{upon a little straw, in the furthest}

\stick{alternately his chair and bed: a little}
\stck{calendar of small sticks were laid at the}
\stick{head notch’d all over with the dismal}
\stck{days and nights he had pass’d there\tskk}
\stick{he had one of these little sticks in his}
\stick{hand, and with a rusty nail he was}
\stick{etching another day of misery to add}
\stick{to the heap.  As I darkened the little}
\stick{light he had, he lifted up a hopeless}
\catch{eye}
\stick{eye towards the door, then cast it}
\stick{down\tskk shook his head, and went on}
\stick{with his work of affliction.  I heard}
\stick{his chains upon his legs, as he turn’d}
\stick{his body to lay his little stick upon the}
\stck{bundle\tskk He gave a deep sigh\tskk I saw}
\stick{the iron enter into his soul\tskk I burst}
\stick{into tears\tskk I could not sustain the}
\stick{picture of confinement which my}
\stick{fancy had drawn\tskk I started up from}
\stick{my chair, and calling La Fleur, I bid}
\stick{him bespeak me a \i{remise}, and have}
\stick{it ready at the door of the hotel by}

\head{32pt}{48}{THE ADDRESS}
\head{24pt}{48}{VERSAILLES}

\vskip 6pt


\initial{I}{should} not like to have my
enemy take a view of my mind when I am
going to ask protection of any man; for
which reason I generally endeavour to
protect myself; but this going to Monsieur
Le Duc de C\astv\ was an act of
compulsion; had it been an act of choice,
I should have done it, I suppose, like
other people.

How many mean plans of dirty address, as I
went along, did my servile heart form!  I
deserved the Bastile for every one of
them.

Then nothing would serve me when I got
within sight of Versailles, but putting
words and sentences together, and
conceiving attitudes and tones to wreath
myself into Monsieur le Duc de C\astv’s
good graces.\tskk This will do, said
I.\tskk Just as well, retorted I again, as
a coat carried up to him by an adventurous
tailor, without taking his measure.  Fool!
continued I\tskk see Monsieur le Duc’s
face first\tskk observe what character is
written in it\tskk take notice in what
posture he stands to hear you\tskk mark
the turns and expressions of his body and
limbs\tskk and for the tone,\tskk the
first sound which comes from his lips will
give it you; and from all these together
you’ll compound an address at once upon
the spot, which cannot disgust the
Duke\tskk the ingredients are his own,
and most likely to go down.

Well! said I, I wish it well over.\tskk
Coward again! as if man to man was not
equal throughout the whole surface of the
globe; and if in the field\tskk why not
face to face in the cabinet too?  And
trust me, Yorick, whenever it is not so,
man is false to himself and betrays his
own succours ten times where nature does
it once.  Go to the Duc de C\anon\ with
the Bastile in thy looks\tskk my life for
it, thou wilt be sent back to Paris in
half an hour with an escort.

I believe so, said I.\tskk Then I’ll go to
the Duke, by heaven! with all the gaiety
and debonairness in the world.\tskk 

\tskk And there you are wrong again,
replied I.\tskk A heart at ease, Yorick,
flies into no extremes\tskk ’tis ever on
its centre.\tskk Well! well! cried I, as
the coachman turn’d in at the gates, I
find I shall do very well: and by the time
he had wheel’d round the court, and
brought me up to the door, I found myself
so much the better for my own lecture,
that I neither ascended the steps like a
victim to justice, who was to part with
life upon the top most\tskk nor did I
mount them with a skip and a couple of
strides, as I do when I fly up, Eliza! to
thee to meet it.

As I entered the door of the saloon I was
met by a person, who possibly might be the
\i{maître d’hôtel}, but had more the air
of one of the under secretaries, who told
me the Duc de C\anon\ was busy.\tskk I am
utterly ignorant, said I, of the forms of
obtaining an audience, being an absolute
stranger, and what is worse in the present
conjuncture of affairs, being an
Englishman too.\tskk He replied, that did
not increase the difficulty.\tskk I made
him a slight bow, and told him, I had
something of importance to say to Monsieur
le Duc.  The secretary look’d towards the
stairs, as if he was about to leave me to
carry up this account to some one.\tskk
But I must not mislead you, said I\tskk
for what I have to say is of no manner of
importance to Monsieur le Duc de
C\anon\tskk but of great importance to
myself.\tskk \i{C’est une autre affaire},
replied he.\tskk Not at all, said I, to a
man of gallantry.\tskk But pray, good sir,
continued I, when can a stranger hope to
have access?\tskk In not less than two
hours, said he, looking at his watch.  The
number of equipages in the court-yard
seemed to justify the calculation, that I
could have no nearer a prospect\tskk and
as walking backwards and forwards in the
saloon, without a soul to commune with,
was for the time as bad as being in the
Bastile itself, I instantly went back to
my remise, and bid the coachman drive me
to the \i{Cordon Bleu}, which was the
nearest hotel.

I think there is a fatality in it\tskk I
seldom go to the place I set out for.




\head{32pt}{48}{LE PATISSIER}
\head{24pt}{48}{VERSAILLES}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{B}{efore} I had got half way down
the street I changed my mind: as I am at
Versailles, thought I, I might as well
take a view of the town; so I pull’d the
cord, and ordered the coachman to drive
round some of the principal streets.\tskk
I suppose the town is not very large, said
I.\tskk The coachman begg’d pardon for
setting me right, and told me it was very
superb, and that numbers of the first
dukes and marquises and counts had
hotels.\tskk The Count de B\anon, of whom
the bookseller at the Quai de Conti had
spoke so handsomely the night before, came
instantly into my mind.\tskk And why
should I not go, thought I, to the Count
de B\anon, who has so high an idea of
English books and English men\tskk and
tell him my story? so I changed my mind a
second time.\tskk In truth it was the
third; for I had intended that day for
Madame de R\tskk , in the Rue St. Pierre,
and had devoutly sent her word by her
Fille de Chambre that I would
assuredly wait upon her\tskk but I am
governed by circumstances\tskk I cannot
govern them: so seeing a man standing with
a basket on the other side of the street,
as if he had something to sell, I bid La
Fleur go up to him, and enquire for the
Count’s hotel.

La Fleur returned a little pale; and told
me it was a Chevalier de St.  Louis
selling pâtés.\tskk It is impossible, La
Fleur, said I.\tskk La Fleur could no more
account for the phenomenon than myself;
but persisted in his story: he had seen
the croix set in gold, with its red
ribband, he said, tied to his
buttonhole\tskk and had looked into the
basket and seen the pâtés which the
Chevalier was selling; so could not be
mistaken in that.

Such a reverse in man’s life awakens a
better principle than curiosity: I could
not help looking for some time at him as I
sat in the remise\tskk the more I look’d
at him, his croix, and his basket, the
stronger they wove themselves into my
brain.\tskk I got out of the remise, and
went towards him.

He was begirt with a clean linen apron
which fell below his knees, and with a
sort of a bib that went half way up his
breast; upon the top of this, but a little
below the hem, hung his croix.  His basket
of little pâtés was covered over with a
white damask napkin; another of the same
kind was spread at the bottom; and there
was a look of \i{propreté} and neatness
throughout, that one might have bought his
pâtés of him, as much from appetite as
sentiment.

He made an offer of them to neither; but
stood still with them at the corner of an
hotel, for those to buy who chose it
without solicitation.

He was about forty-eight\tskk of a sedate
look, something approaching to gravity.  I
did not wonder.\tskk I went up rather to
the basket than him, and having lifted up
the napkin, and taking one of his pâtés
into my hand\tskk I begg’d he would
explain the appearance which affected me.

He told me in a few words, that the best
part of his life had passed in the
service, in which, after spending a small
patrimony, he had obtained a company and
the croix with it; but that, at the
conclusion of the last peace, his regiment
being reformed, and the whole corps, with
those of some other regiments, left
without any provision, he found himself in
a wide world without friends, without a
livre\tskk and indeed, said he, without
anything but this\tskk (pointing, as he
said it, to his croix).\tskk The poor
Chevalier won my pity, and he finished the
scene with winning my esteem too.

The king, he said, was the most generous
of princes, but his generosity could
neither relieve nor reward everyone, and
it was only his misfortune to be amongst
the number.  He had a little wife, he
said, whom he loved, who did the
\i{pâtisserie}; and added, he felt no
dishonour in defending her and himself
from want in this way\tskk unless
Providence had offer’d him a better.

It would be wicked to withhold a pleasure
from the good, in passing over what
happen’d to this poor Chevalier of St.
Louis about nine months after.

It seems he usually took his stand near
the iron gates which lead up to the
palace, and as his croix had caught the
eyes of numbers, numbers had made the same
enquiry which I had done.\tskk He had told
them the same story, and always with so
much modesty and good sense, that it had
reach’d at last the king’s ears\tskk who,
hearing the Chevalier had been a gallant
officer, and respected by the whole
regiment as a man of honour and
integrity\tskk he broke up his little
trade by a pension of fifteen hundred
livres a year.

As I have told this to please the reader,
I beg he will allow me to relate another,
out of its order, to please myself\tskk
the two stories reflect light upon each
other\tskk and ’tis a pity they should be
parted.




\head{32pt}{48}{THE SWORD}
\head{24pt}{48}{RENNES}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{W}{hen} states and empires have
their periods of declension, and feel in
their turns what distress and poverty
is\tskk I stop not to tell the causes
which gradually brought the house
d’E\anon, in Brittany, into decay.  The
Marquis d’E\anon\ had fought up against
his condition with great firmness; wishing
to preserve, and still shew to the world,
some little fragments of what his
ancestors had been\tskk their
indiscretions had put it out of his power.
There was enough left for the little
exigencies of \i{obscurity}.\tskk But he
had two boys who looked up to him for
\i{light}\tskk he thought they deserved
it.  He had tried his sword\tskk it could
not open the way\tskk the \i{mounting}
was too expensive\tskk and simple economy
was not a match for it\tskk there was no
resource but commerce.

In any other province in France, save
Brittany, this was smiting the root for
ever of the little tree his pride and
affection wish’d to see re-blossom.\tskk
But in Brittany, there being a provision
for this, he avail’d himself of it; and,
taking an occasion when the states were
assembled at Rennes, the Marquis, attended
with his two boys, entered the court; and
having pleaded the right of an ancient law
of the duchy, which, though seldom
claim’d, he said, was no less in force, he
took his sword from his side\tskk Here,
said he, take it; and be trusty guardians
of it, till better times put me in
condition to reclaim it.

The president accepted the Marquis’s
sword: he staid a few minutes to see it
deposited in the archives of his
house\tskk and departed.

The Marquis and his whole family embarked
the next day for Martinico, and in about
nineteen or twenty years of successful
application to business, with some
unlook’d for bequests from distant
branches of his house, return home to
reclaim his nobility, and to support it.

It was an incident of good fortune which
will never happen to any traveller but a
Sentimental one, that I should be at
Rennes at the very time of this solemn
requisition: I call it solemn\tskk it was
so to me.

The Marquis entered the court with his
whole family: he supported his lady\tskk
his eldest son supported his sister, and
his youngest was at the other extreme of
the line next his mother\tskk he put his
handkerchief to his face twice.\tskk 

\tskk There was a dead silence.  When the
Marquis had approached within six paces of
the tribunal, he gave the Marchioness to
his youngest son, and advancing three
steps before his family\tskk he reclaim’d
his sword.  His sword was given him, and
the moment he got it into his hand he drew
it almost out of the scabbard\tskk ’twas
the shining face of a friend he had once
given up\tskk he look’d attentively along
it, beginning at the hilt, as if to see
whether it was the same\tskk when,
observing a little rust which it had
contracted near the point, he brought it
near his eye, and bending his head down
over it\tskk I think\tskk I saw a tear
fall upon the place.  I could not be
deceived by what followed.

\lqq I shall find,\rqq\ said he, \lqq some \i{other
way} to get it off.\rqq 

When the Marquis had said this, he
returned his sword into its scabbard, made
a bow to the guardians of it\tskk and,
with his wife and daughter, and his two
sons following him, walk’d out.

O, how I envied him his feelings!

\initial{I}{found} no difficulty in
getting admittance to Monsieur le Count de
B\anon.  The set of Shakespears was laid
upon the table, and he was tumbling them
over.  I walk’d up close to the table, and
giving first such a look at the books as
to make him conceive I knew what they
were\tskk I told him I had come without
any one to present me, knowing I should
meet with a friend in his apartment, who,
I trusted, would do it for me\tskk it is
my countryman, the great Shakespear, said
I, pointing to his works\tskk \i{et ayez
la bonté}, \i{mon cher ami},
apostrophizing his spirit, added I, \i{de
me faire cet honneur-là}.\tskk 

The Count smiled at the singularity of the
introduction; and seeing I look’d a little
pale and sickly, insisted upon my taking
an arm-chair; so I sat down; and to save
him conjectures upon a visit so out of all
rule, I told him simply of the incident in
the bookseller’s shop, and how that had
impelled me rather to go to him with the
story of a little embarrassment I was
under, than to any other man in
France.\tskk And what is your
embarrassment? let me hear it, said the
Count.  So I told him the story just as I
have told it the reader.

\tskk And the master of my hotel, said I,
as I concluded it, will needs have it,
Monsieur le Count, that I shall be sent to
the Bastile\tskk but I have no
apprehensions, continued I\tskk for, in
falling into the hands of the most
polish’d people in the world, and being
conscious I was a true man, and not come
to spy the nakedness of the land, I scarce
thought I lay at their mercy.\tskk It does
not suit the gallantry of the French,
Monsieur le Count, said I, to shew it
against invalids.

An animated blush came into the Count de
B\anon’s cheeks as I spoke this.\tskk
\i{Ne craignez rien}\tskk Don’t fear, said
he.\tskk Indeed, I don’t, replied I
again.\tskk Besides, continued I, a little
sportingly, I have come laughing all the
way from London to Paris, and I do not
think Monsieur le Duc de Choiseul is such
an enemy to mirth as to send me back
crying for my pains.

\tskk My application to you, Monsieur le
Count de B\anon\ (making him a low bow),
is to desire he will not.

The Count heard me with great good nature,
or I had not said half as much\tskk and
once or twice said\tskk \i{C’est bien
dit}.  So I rested my cause there\tskk and
determined to say no more about it.

The Count led the discourse: we talk’d of
indifferent things\tskk of books, and
politics, and men\tskk and then of
women.\tskk God bless them all! said I,
after much discourse about them\tskk there
is not a man upon earth who loves them so
much as I do: after all the foibles I have
seen, and all the satires I have read
against them, still I love them; being
firmly persuaded that a man, who has not a
sort of affection for the whole sex, is
incapable of ever loving a single one as
he ought.

\i{Eh bien}!  \i{Monsieur l’Anglois}, said
the Count, gaily\tskk you are not come to
spy the nakedness of the land\tskk I
believe you\tskk \i{ni encore}, I dare
say, \i{that} of our women!\tskk But
permit me to conjecture\tskk if, \i{par
hazard}, they fell into your way, that the
prospect would not affect you.

I have something within me which cannot
bear the shock of the least indecent
insinuation: in the sportability of
chit-chat I have often endeavoured to
conquer it, and with infinite pain have
hazarded a thousand things to a dozen of
the sex together\tskk the least of which
I could not venture to a single one to
gain heaven.

Excuse me, Monsieur le Count, said I\tskk
as for the nakedness of your land, if I
saw it, I should cast my eyes over it with
tears in them\tskk and for that of your
women (blushing at the idea he had excited
in me) I am so evangelical in this, and
have such a fellow-feeling for whatever is
weak about them, that I would cover it
with a garment if I knew how to throw it
on\tskk But I could wish, continued I, to
spy the nakedness of their hearts, and
through the different disguises of
customs, climates, and religion, find out
what is good in them to fashion my own
by\tskk and therefore am I come.

It is for this reason, Monsieur le Count,
continued I, that I have not seen the
Palais Royal\tskk nor the
Luxembourg\tskk nor the Façade of the
Louvre\tskk nor have attempted to swell
the catalogues we have of pictures,
statues, and churches.\tskk I conceive
every fair being as a temple, and would
rather enter in, and see the original
drawings and loose sketches hung up in it,
than the Transfiguration of Raphael
itself.

The thirst of this, continued I, as
impatient as that which inflames the
breast of the connoisseur, has led me from
my own home into France\tskk and from
France will lead me through Italy\tskk
’tis a quiet journey of the heart in
pursuit of Nature, and those affections
which arise out of her, which make us love
each other\tskk and the world, better
than we do.

The Count said a great many civil things
to me upon the occasion; and added very
politely, how much he stood obliged to
Shakespear for making me known to
him.\tskk But \i{à propos}, said he\tskk
Shakespear is full of great things\tskk
he forgot a small punctilio of announcing
your name\tskk it puts you under a
necessity of doing it yourself.

\dropcap{T}{here} is not a more perplexing
affair in life to me, than to set about
telling any one who I am\tskk for there
is scarce any body I cannot give a better
account of than myself; and I have often
wished I could do it in a single
word\tskk and have an end of it.  It was
the only time and occasion in my life I
could accomplish this to any purpose\tskk
for Shakespear lying upon the table, and
recollecting I was in his books, I took up
Hamlet, and turning immediately to the
grave-diggers’ scene in the fifth act, I
laid my finger upon Yorick, and advancing
the book to the Count, with my finger all
the way over the name\tskk \i{Me voici}!
said I.

Now, whether the idea of poor Yorick’s
skull was put out of the Count’s mind by
the reality of my own, or by what magic he
could drop a period of seven or eight
hundred years, makes nothing in this
account\tskk ’tis certain the French
conceive better than they combine\tskk I
wonder at nothing in this world, and the
less at this; inasmuch as one of the first
of our own Church, for whose candour and
paternal sentiments I have the highest
veneration, fell into the same mistake in
the very same case\tskk \lqq He could not
bear,\rqq\ he said, \lqq to look into the sermons
wrote by the King of Denmark’s jester.\rqq 
Good, my Lord said I; but there are two
Yoricks.  The Yorick your Lordship thinks
of, has been dead and buried eight hundred
years ago; he flourished in Horwendillus’s
court\tskk the other Yorick is myself,
who have flourished, my Lord, in no
court.\tskk He shook his head.  Good God!
said I, you might as well confound
Alexander the Great with Alexander the
Coppersmith, my lord!\tskk \lqq ’Twas all
one,\rqq\ he replied.\tskk 

\tskk If Alexander, King of Macedon, could
have translated your Lordship, said I, I’m
sure your Lordship would not have said so.

The poor Count de B\anon\ fell but into
the same \i{error}.

\tskk \i{Et}, \i{Monsieur}, \i{est-il
Yorick}? cried the Count.\tskk \i{Je le
suis}, said I.\tskk \i{Vous}?\tskk
\i{Moi}\tskk \i{moi qui ai l’honneur de
vous parler}, \i{Monsieur le Comte}.\tskk
\i{Mon Dieu}! said he, embracing me\tskk
\i{Vous êtes Yorick}!

The Count instantly put the Shakespear
into his pocket, and left me alone in his
room.

rough for my feet, or too steep for my
strength, I get off it, to some smooth
velvet path, which Fancy has scattered
over with rosebuds of delights; and having
taken a few turns in it, come back
strengthened and refresh’d.\tskk When
evils press sore upon me, and there is no
retreat from them in this world, then I
take a new course\tskk I leave it,\tskk
and as I have a clearer idea of the
Elysian fields than I have of heaven, I
force myself, like Æneas, into them.\tskk
I see him meet the pensive shade of his
forsaken Dido, and wish to recognise
it\tskk I see the injured spirit wave her
head, and turn off silent from the author
of her miseries and dishonours\tskk I
lose the feelings for myself in hers, and
in those affections which were wont to
make me mourn for her when I was at
school.

\i{Surely this is not walking in a vain
shadow\tskk nor does man disquiet himself}
in vain \i{by it}\tskk he oftener does so
in trusting the issue of his commotions to
reason only.\tskk I can safely say for
myself, I was never able to conquer any
one single bad sensation in my heart so
decisively, as beating up as fast as I
could for some kindly and gentle sensation
to fight it upon its own ground.

When I had got to the end of the third act
the Count de B\anon\ entered, with my
passport in his hand.  Mons.\@ le Duc de
C\anon, said the Count, is as good a
prophet, I dare say, as he is a statesman.
\i{Un homme qui rit}, said the Duke, \i{ne
sera jamais dangereux}.\tskk Had it been
for any one but the king’s jester, added
the Count, I could not have got it these
two hours.\tskk \i{Pardonnez moi},
Monsieur le Count, said I\tskk I am not
the king’s jester.\tskk But you are
Yorick?\tskk Yes.\tskk \i{Et vous
plaisantez}?\tskk I answered, Indeed I did
jest\tskk but was not paid for it;\tskk
’twas intirely at my own expense.

We have no jester at court, Monsieur le
Count, said I; the last we had was in the
licentious reign of Charles II.\tskk
since which time our manners have been so
gradually refining, that our court at
present is so full of patriots, who wish
for \i{nothing} but the honours and wealth
of their country\tskk and our ladies are
all so chaste, so spotless, so good, so
devout\tskk there is nothing for a jester
to make a jest of.\tskk 

\i{Voilà un persiflage}! cried the Count.




\head{32pt}{48}{THE PASSPORT}
\head{24pt}{48}{VERSAILLES}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{A}{s} the passport was directed
to all lieutenant-governors, governors,
and commandants of cities, generals of
armies, justiciaries, and all officers of
justice, to let Mr. Yorick the king’s
jester, and his baggage, travel quietly
along, I own the triumph of obtaining the
passport was not a little tarnish’d by the
figure I cut in it.\tskk But there is
nothing unmix’d in this world; and some of
the gravest of our divines have carried it
so far as to affirm, that enjoyment itself
was attended even with a sigh\tskk and
that the greatest \i{they knew of}
terminated, \i{in a general way}, in
little better than a convulsion.

I remember the grave and learned
Bevoriskius, in his Commentary upon the
Generations from Adam, very naturally
breaks off in the middle of a note to give
an account to the world of a couple of
sparrows upon the out-edge of his window,
which had incommoded him all the time he
wrote, and at last had intirely taken him
off from his genealogy.

\tskk ’Tis strange! writes Bevoriskius;
but the facts are certain, for I have had
the curiosity to mark them down one by one
with my pen\tskk but the cock sparrow,
during the little time that I could have
finished the other half of this note, has
actually interrupted me with the
reiteration of his caresses
three-and-twenty times and a half.

How merciful, adds Bevoriskius, is heaven
to his creatures!

Ill fated Yorick! that the gravest of thy
brethren should be able to write that to
the world, which stains thy face with
crimson to copy, even in thy study.

But this is nothing to my travels.\tskk So
I twice\tskk twice beg pardon for it.




\head{32pt}{48}{CHARACTER}
\head{24pt}{48}{VERSAILLES}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{A}{nd} how do you find the
French? said the Count de B\anon, after
he had given me the passport.

The reader may suppose, that after so
obliging a proof of courtesy, I could not
be at a loss to say something handsome to
the enquiry.

\tskk \i{Mais passe}, \i{pour cela}.\tskk
Speak frankly, said he: do you find all
the urbanity in the French which the world
give us the honour of?\tskk I had found
every thing, I said, which confirmed
it.\tskk \i{Vraiment}, said the Count,
\i{les François sont polis}.\tskk To an
excess, replied I.

The Count took notice of the word
\i{excès}; and would have it I meant more
than I said.  I defended myself a long
time as well as I could against it.\tskk
He insisted I had a reserve, and that I
would speak my opinion frankly.

I believe, Monsieur le Count, said I, that
man has a certain compass, as well as an
instrument; and that the social and other
calls have occasion by turns for every key
in him; so that if you begin a note too
high or too low, there must be a want
either in the upper or under part, to fill
up the system of harmony.\tskk The Count
de B\anon\ did not understand music, so
desired me to explain it some other way.
A polish’d nation, my dear Count, said I,
makes every one its debtor: and besides,
Urbanity itself, like the fair sex, has so
many charms, it goes against the heart to
say it can do ill; and yet, I believe,
there is but a certain line of perfection,
that man, take him altogether, is
empower’d to arrive at\tskk if he gets
beyond, he rather exchanges qualities than
gets them.  I must not presume to say how
far this has affected the French in the
subject we are speaking of\tskk but,
should it ever be the case of the English,
in the progress of their refinements, to
arrive at the same polish which
distinguishes the French, if we did not
lose the \i{politesse du cœur}, which
inclines men more to humane actions than
courteous ones\tskk we should at least
lose that distinct variety and originality
of character, which distinguishes them,
not only from each other, but from all the
world besides.

I had a few of King William’s shillings,
as smooth as glass, in my pocket; and
foreseeing they would be of use in the
illustration of my hypothesis, I had got
them into my hand when I had proceeded so
far\tskk 

See, Monsieur le Count, said I, rising up,
and laying them before him upon the
table\tskk by jingling and rubbing one
against another for seventy years together
in one body’s pocket or another’s, they
are become so much alike, you can scarce
distinguish one shilling from another.

The English, like ancient medals, kept
more apart, and passing but few people’s
hands, preserve the first sharpnesses
which the fine hand of Nature has given
them\tskk they are not so pleasant to
feel\tskk but in return the legend is so
visible, that at the first look you see
whose image and superscription they
bear.\tskk But the French, Monsieur le
Count, added I (wishing to soften what I
had said), have so many excellences, they
can the better spare this\tskk they are a
loyal, a gallant, a generous, an
ingenious, and good temper’d people as is
under heaven\tskk if they have a
fault\tskk they are too \i{serious}.

\i{Mon Dieu}! cried the Count, rising out
of his chair.

\i{Mais vous plaisantez}, said he,
correcting his exclamation.\tskk I laid my
hand upon my breast, and with earnest
gravity assured him it was my most settled
opinion.

The Count said he was mortified he could
not stay to hear my reasons, being engaged
to go that moment to dine with the Duc de
C\tskk .

But if it is not too far to come to
Versailles to eat your soup with me, I
beg, before you leave France, I may have
the pleasure of knowing you retract your
opinion\tskk or, in what manner you
support it.\tskk But, if you do support
it, Monsieur Anglois, said he, you must do
it with all your powers, because you have
the whole world against you.\tskk I
promised the Count I would do myself the
honour of dining with him before I set out
for Italy\tskk so took my leave.




\head{32pt}{48}{THE TEMPTATION}
\head{24pt}{48}{PARIS}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{W}{hen} I alighted at the hotel,
the porter told me a young woman with a
bandbox had been that moment enquiring for
me.\tskk I do not know, said the porter,
whether she is gone away or not.  I took
the key of my chamber of him, and went
upstairs; and when I had got within ten
steps of the top of the landing before my
door, I met her coming easily down.

It was the fair Fille de Chambre I had
walked along the Quai de Conti with;
Madame de R\tskk  had sent her upon some
commission to a \i{marchande des modes}
within a step or two of the Hôtel de
Modene; and as I had fail’d in waiting
upon her, had bid her enquire if I had
left Paris; and if so, whether I had not
left a letter addressed to her.

As the fair Fille de Chambre was so
near my door, she returned back, and went
into the room with me for a moment or two
whilst I wrote a card.

It was a fine still evening in the latter
end of the month of May\tskk the crimson
window curtains (which were of the same
colour as those of the bed) were drawn
close\tskk the sun was setting, and
reflected through them so warm a tint into
the fair \i{fille de chambre’s} face\tskk
I thought she blush’d\tskk the idea of it
made me blush myself\tskk we were quite
alone; and that superinduced a second
blush before the first could get off.

There is a sort of a pleasing half guilty
blush, where the blood is more in fault
than the man\tskk ’tis sent impetuous
from the heart, and virtue flies after
it\tskk not to call it back, but to make
the sensation of it more delicious to the
nerves\tskk ’tis associated.\tskk 

But I’ll not describe it\tskk I felt
something at first within me which was not
in strict unison with the lesson of virtue
I had given her the night before.\tskk I
sought five minutes for a card\tskk I
knew I had not one.\tskk I took up a
pen.\tskk I laid it down again\tskk my
hand trembled\tskk the devil was in me.

I know as well as any one he is an
adversary, whom, if we resist, he will fly
from us\tskk but I seldom resist him at
all; from a terror, though I may conquer,
I may still get a hurt in the combat\tskk
so I give up the triumph for security;
and, instead of thinking to make him fly,
I generally fly myself.

The fair Fille de Chambre came close
up to the bureau where I was looking for a
card\tskk took up first the pen I cast
down, then offer’d to hold me the ink; she
offer’d it so sweetly, I was going to
accept it\tskk but I durst not;\tskk I
have nothing, my dear, said I, to write
upon.\tskk Write it, said she, simply,
upon anything.\tskk 

I was just going to cry out, Then I will
write it, fair girl! upon thy lips.\tskk 

If I do, said I, I shall perish\tskk so I
took her by the hand, and led her to the
door, and begg’d she would not forget the
lesson I had given her.\tskk She said,
indeed she would not\tskk and, as she
uttered it with some earnestness, she
turn’d about, and gave me both her hands,
closed together, into mine\tskk it was
impossible not to compress them in that
situation\tskk I wish’d to let them go;
and all the time I held them, I kept
arguing within myself against it\tskk and
still I held them on.\tskk In two minutes
I found I had all the battle to fight over
again\tskk and I felt my legs and every
limb about me tremble at the idea.

The foot of the bed was within a yard and
a half of the place where we were
standing.\tskk I had still hold of her
hands\tskk and how it happened I can give
no account; but I neither ask’d her\tskk
nor drew her\tskk nor did I think of the
bed\tskk but so it did happen, we both
sat down.

I’ll just shew you, said the fair \i{fille
de chambre}, the little purse I have been
making to-day to hold your crown.  So she
put her hand into her right pocket, which
was next me, and felt for it some
time\tskk then into the left.\tskk \lqq She
had lost it.\rqq \tskk I never bore
expectation more quietly\tskk it was in
her right pocket at last\tskk she pull’d
it out; it was of green taffeta, lined
with a little bit of white quilted satin,
and just big enough to hold the crown: she
put it into my hand\tskk it was pretty;
and I held it ten minutes with the back of
my hand resting upon her lap\tskk looking
sometimes at the purse, sometimes on one
side of it.

A stitch or two had broke out in the
gathers of my stock; the fair \i{fille de
chambre}, without saying a word, took out
her little housewife, threaded a small
needle, and sew’d it up.\tskk I foresaw it
would hazard the glory of the day; and, as
she pass’d her hand in silence across and
across my neck in the manœuvre, I felt the
laurels shake which fancy had wreath’d
about my head.

A strap had given way in her walk, and the
buckle of her shoe was just falling
off.\tskk See, said the \i{fille de
chambre}, holding up her foot.\tskk I
could not, for my soul but fasten the
buckle in return, and putting in the
strap\tskk and lifting up the other foot
with it, when I had done, to see both were
right\tskk in doing it too suddenly, it
unavoidably threw the fair \i{fille de
chambre} off her centre\tskk and
then\tskk 




\head{32pt}{48}{THE CONQUEST}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{Y}{es}\tskk and then\tskk .  Ye
whose clay-cold heads and luke-warm hearts
can argue down or mask your passions, tell
me, what trespass is it that man should
have them? or how his spirit stands
answerable to the Father of spirits but
for his conduct under them?

If Nature has so wove her web of kindness,
that some threads of love and desire are
entangled with the piece\tskk must the
whole web be rent in drawing them
out?\tskk Whip me such stoics, great
Governor of Nature! said I to myself\tskk
wherever thy providence shall place me for
the trials of my virtue\tskk whatever is
my danger\tskk whatever is my
situation\tskk let me feel the movements
which rise out of it, and which belong to
me as a man\tskk and, if I govern them as
a good one, I will trust the issues to thy
justice; for thou hast made us, and not we
ourselves.

As I finished my address, I raised the
fair Fille de Chambre up by the hand,
and led her out of the room\tskk she
stood by me till I locked the door and put
the key in my pocket\tskk and then,\tskk
the victory being quite decisive\tskk and
not till then, I press’d my lips to her
cheek, and taking her by the hand again,
led her safe to the gate of the hotel.




\head{32pt}{48}{THE MYSTERY}
\head{24pt}{48}{PARIS}

\vskip 6pt


If a man knows the heart, he will know it
was impossible to go back instantly to my
chamber\tskk it was touching a cold key
with a flat third to it upon the close of
a piece of music, which had call’d forth
my affections\tskk therefore, when I let
go the hand of the Fille de Chambre, I
remained at the gate of the hotel for some
time, looking at every one who pass’d
by\tskk and forming conjectures upon
them, till my attention got fix’d upon a
single object which confounded all kind of
reasoning upon him.

It was a tall figure of a philosophic,
serious, adust look, which passed and
repass’d sedately along the street, making
a turn of about sixty paces on each side
of the gate of the hotel\tskk the man was
about fifty-two\tskk had a small cane
under his arm\tskk was dress’d in a dark
drab-colour’d coat, waistcoat, and
breeches, which seem’d to have seen some
years service\tskk they were still clean,
and there was a little air of frugal
\i{propreté} throughout him.  By his
pulling off his hat, and his attitude of
accosting a good many in his way, I saw he
was asking charity: so I got a sous or two
out of my pocket ready to give him, as he
took me in his turn.\tskk He pass’d by me
without asking anything\tskk and yet did
not go five steps further before he ask’d
charity of a little woman.\tskk I was much
more likely to have given of the two.\tskk
He had scarce done with the woman, when he
pull’d off his hat to another who was
coming the same way.\tskk An ancient
gentleman came slowly\tskk and, after him,
a young smart one.\tskk He let them both
pass, and ask’d nothing.  I stood
observing him half an hour, in which time
he had made a dozen turns backwards and
forwards, and found that he invariably
pursued the same plan.

There were two things very singular in
this, which set my brain to work, and to
no purpose\tskk the first was, why the
man should \i{only} tell his story to the
sex\tskk and, secondly,\tskk what kind of
story it was, and what species of
eloquence it could be, which soften’d the
hearts of the women, which he knew ’twas
to no purpose to practise upon the men.

There were two other circumstances, which
entangled this mystery\tskk the one was,
he told every woman what he had to say in
her ear, and in a way which had much more
the air of a secret than a petition\tskk
the other was, it was always
successful.\tskk He never stopp’d a woman,
but she pull’d out her purse, and
immediately gave him something.

I could form no system to explain the
phenomenon.

I had got a riddle to amuse me for the
rest of the evening; so I walk’d upstairs
to my chamber.




\head{32pt}{48}{THE CASE OF CONSCIENCE}
\head{24pt}{48}{PARIS}

\vskip 6pt


\initial{I}{was} immediately followed up
by the master of the hotel, who came into
my room to tell me I must provide lodgings
elsewhere.\tskk How so, friend?  said
I.\tskk He answered, I had had a young
woman lock’d up with me two hours that
evening in my bedchamber, and ’twas
against the rules of his house.\tskk Very
well, said I, we’ll all part friends
then\tskk for the girl is no worse,\tskk
and I am no worse\tskk and you will be
just as I found you.\tskk It was enough,
he said, to overthrow the credit of his
hotel.\tskk \i{Voyez vous}, Monsieur, said
he, pointing to the foot of the bed we had
been sitting upon.\tskk I own it had
something of the appearance of an
evidence; but my pride not suffering me to
enter into any detail of the case, I
exhorted him to let his soul sleep in
peace, as I resolved to let mine do that
night, and that I would discharge what I
owed him at breakfast.

I should not have minded, Monsieur, said
he, if you had had twenty girls\tskk ’Tis
a score more, replied I, interrupting him,
than I ever reckon’d upon\tskk Provided,
added he, it had been but in a
morning.\tskk And does the difference of
the time of the day at Paris make a
difference in the sin?\tskk It made a
difference, he said, in the scandal.\tskk
I like a good distinction in my heart; and
cannot say I was intolerably out of temper
with the man.\tskk I own it is necessary,
resumed the master of the hotel, that a
stranger at Paris should have the
opportunities presented to him of buying
lace and silk stockings and ruffles, \i{et
tout cela}\tskk and ’tis nothing if a
woman comes with a band-box.\tskk O, my
conscience! said I, she had one but I
never look’d into it.\tskk Then Monsieur,
said he, has bought nothing?\tskk Not one
earthly thing, replied I.\tskk Because,
said he, I could recommend one to you who
would use you \i{en conscience}.\tskk But
I must see her this night, said I.\tskk He
made me a low bow, and walk’d down.

Now shall I triumph over this \i{maître
d’hôtel}, cried I\tskk and what then?
Then I shall let him see I know he is a
dirty fellow.\tskk And what then?  What
then?\tskk I was too near myself to say it
was for the sake of others.\tskk I had no
good answer left\tskk there was more of
spleen than principle in my project, and I
was sick of it before the execution.

In a few minutes the grisette came in with
her box of lace.\tskk I’ll buy nothing,
however, said I, within myself.

The grisette would shew me
everything.\tskk I was hard to please: she
would not seem to see it; she opened her
little magazine, and laid all her laces
one after another before me\tskk unfolded
and folded them up again one by one with
the most patient sweetness.\tskk I might
buy\tskk or not;\tskk she would let me
have everything at my own price\tskk the
poor creature seem’d anxious to get a
penny; and laid herself out to win me, and
not so much in a manner which seem’d
artful, as in one I felt simple and
caressing.

If there is not a fund of honest
gullibility in man, so much the
worse\tskk my heart relented, and I gave
up my second resolution as quietly as the
first.\tskk Why should I chastise one for
the trespass of another?  If thou art
tributary to this tyrant of an host,
thought I, looking up in her face, so much
harder is thy bread.

If I had not had more than four louis
d’ors in my purse, there was no such thing
as rising up and shewing her the door,
till I had first laid three of them out in
a pair of ruffles.

\tskk The master of the hotel will share
the profit with her\tskk no matter,\tskk
then I have only paid as many a poor soul
has \i{paid} before me, for an act he
\i{could} not do, or think of.




\head{32pt}{48}{THE RIDDLE}
\head{24pt}{48}{PARIS}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{W}{hen} La Fleur came up to wait
upon me at supper, he told me how sorry
the master of the hotel was for his
affront to me in bidding me change my
lodgings.

A man who values a good night’s rest will
not lie down with enmity in his heart, if
he can help it.\tskk So I bid La Fleur
tell the master of the hotel, that I was
sorry on my side for the occasion I had
given him\tskk and you may tell him, if
you will, La Fleur, added I, that if the
young woman should call again, I shall not
see her.

This was a sacrifice not to him, but
myself, having resolved, after so narrow
an escape, to run no more risks, but to
leave Paris, if it was possible, with all
the virtue I enter’d it.

\i{C’est déroger à noblesse},
\i{Monsieur}, said La Fleur, making me a
bow down to the ground as he said it.\tskk
\i{Et encore}, \i{Monsieur}, said he, may
change his sentiments\tskk and if (\i{par
hazard}) he should like to amuse
himself\tskk I find no amusement in it,
said I, interrupting him.\tskk 

\i{Mon Dieu}! said La Fleur\tskk and took
away.

In an hour’s time he came to put me to
bed, and was more than commonly
officious\tskk something hung upon his
lips to say to me, or ask me, which he
could not get off: I could not conceive
what it was, and indeed gave myself little
trouble to find it out, as I had another
riddle so much more interesting upon my
mind, which was that of the man’s asking
charity before the door of the hotel.\tskk
I would have given anything to have got to
the bottom of it; and that, not out of
curiosity\tskk ’tis so low a principle of
enquiry, in general, I would not purchase
the gratification of it with a two-sous
piece\tskk but a secret, I thought, which
so soon and so certainly soften’d the
heart of every woman you came near, was a
secret at least equal to the philosopher’s
stone; had I both the Indies, I would have
given up one to have been master of it.

I toss’d and turn’d it almost all night
long in my brains to no manner of purpose;
and when I awoke in the morning, I found
my spirits as much troubled with my
dreams, as ever the King of Babylon had
been with his; and I will not hesitate to
affirm, it would have puzzled all the wise
men of Paris as much as those of Chaldea
to have given its interpretation.




\head{32pt}{48}{LE DIMANCHE}
\head{24pt}{48}{PARIS}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{I}{t} was Sunday; and when La
Fleur came in, in the morning, with my
coffee and roll and butter, he had got
himself so gallantly array’d, I scarce
knew him.

I had covenanted at Montreuil to give him
a new hat with a silver button and loop,
and four louis d’ors, \i{pour s’adoniser},
when we got to Paris; and the poor fellow,
to do him justice, had done wonders with
it.

He had bought a bright, clean, good
scarlet coat, and a pair of breeches of
the same.\tskk They were not a crown
worse, he said, for the wearing.\tskk I
wish’d him hang’d for telling me.\tskk
They look’d so fresh, that though I knew
the thing could not be done, yet I would
rather have imposed upon my fancy with
thinking I had bought them new for the
fellow, than that they had come out of the
Rue de Friperie.

This is a nicety which makes not the heart
sore at Paris.

He had purchased, moreover, a handsome
blue satin waistcoat, fancifully enough
embroidered\tskk this was indeed
something the worse for the service it had
done, but ’twas clean scour’d\tskk the
gold had been touch’d up, and upon the
whole was rather shewy than
otherwise\tskk and as the blue was not
violent, it suited with the coat and
breeches very well: he had squeez’d out of
the money, moreover, a new bag and a
solitaire; and had insisted with the
\i{fripier} upon a gold pair of garters to
his breeches knees.\tskk He had purchased
muslin ruffles, \i{bien brodées}, with
four livres of his own money\tskk and a
pair of white silk stockings for five
more\tskk and to top all, nature had
given him a handsome figure, without
costing him a sous.

He entered the room thus set off, with his
hair dressed in the first style, and with
a handsome bouquet in his breast.\tskk In
a word, there was that look of festivity
in everything about him, which at once put
me in mind it was Sunday\tskk and, by
combining both together, it instantly
struck me, that the favour he wish’d to
ask of me the night before, was to spend
the day as every body in Paris spent it
besides.  I had scarce made the
conjecture, when La Fleur, with infinite
humility, but with a look of trust, as if
I should not refuse him, begg’d I would
grant him the day, \i{pour faire le galant
vis-à-vis de sa maîtresse}.

Now it was the very thing I intended to do
myself vis-à-vis Madame de R\tskk .\tskk I
had retained the remise on purpose for it,
and it would not have mortified my vanity
to have had a servant so well dress’d as
La Fleur was, to have got up behind it: I
never could have worse spared him.

But we must \i{feel}, not argue in these
embarrassments.\tskk The sons and
daughters of Service part with liberty,
but not with nature, in their contracts;
they are flesh and blood, and have their
little vanities and wishes in the midst of
the house of bondage, as well as their
task-masters\tskk no doubt, they have set
their self-denials at a price\tskk and
their expectations are so unreasonable,
that I would often disappoint them, but
that their condition puts it so much in my
power to do it.

\i{Behold}\tskk \i{Behold}, \i{I am thy
servant}\tskk disarms me at once of the
powers of a master.\tskk 

Thou shalt go, La Fleur! said I.

\tskk And what mistress, La Fleur, said I,
canst thou have picked up in so little a
time at Paris?  La Fleur laid his hand
upon his breast, and said ’twas a
\i{petite demoiselle}, at Monsieur le
Count de B\anon’s.\tskk La Fleur had a
heart made for society; and, to speak the
truth of him, let as few occasions slip
him as his master\tskk so that somehow or
other\tskk but how,\tskk heaven
knows\tskk he had connected himself with
the demoiselle upon the landing of the
staircase, during the time I was taken up
with my passport; and as there was time
enough for me to win the Count to my
interest, La Fleur had contrived to make
it do to win the maid to his.  The family,
it seems, was to be at Paris that day, and
he had made a party with her, and two or
three more of the Count’s household, upon
the boulevards.

Happy people! that once a week at least
are sure to lay down all your cares
together, and dance and sing and sport
away the weights of grievance, which bow
down the spirit of other nations to the
earth.

\dropcap{L}{a Fleur} had left me something
to amuse myself with for the day more than
I had bargain’d for, or could have enter’d
either into his head or mine.

He had brought the little print of butter
upon a currant leaf: and as the morning
was warm, and he had a good step to bring
it, he had begg’d a sheet of waste paper
to put betwixt the currant leaf and his
hand.\tskk As that was plate sufficient, I
bade him lay it upon the table as it was;
and as I resolved to stay within all day,
I ordered him to call upon the
\i{traîteur}, to bespeak my dinner, and
leave me to breakfast by myself.

When I had finished the butter, I threw
the currant-leaf out of the window, and
was going to do the same by the waste
paper\tskk but stopping to read a line
first, and that drawing me on to a second
and third\tskk I thought it better worth;
so I shut the window, and drawing a chair
up to it, I sat down to read it.

It was in the old French of Rabelais’s
time, and for aught I know might have been
wrote by him\tskk it was moreover in a
Gothic letter, and that so faded and gone
off by damps and length of time, it cost
me infinite trouble to make anything of
it.\tskk I threw it down; and then wrote a
letter to Eugenius\tskk then I took it up
again, and embroiled my patience with it
afresh\tskk and then to cure that, I
wrote a letter to Eliza.\tskk Still it
kept hold of me; and the difficulty of
understanding it increased but the desire.

I got my dinner; and after I had
enlightened my mind with a bottle of
Burgundy; I at it again\tskk and, after
two or three hours poring upon it, with
almost as deep attention as ever Gruter or
Jacob Spon did upon a nonsensical
inscription, I thought I made sense of it;
but to make sure of it, the best way, I
imagined, was to turn it into English, and
see how it would look then\tskk so I went
on leisurely, as a trifling man does,
sometimes writing a sentence\tskk then
taking a turn or two\tskk and then
looking how the world went, out of the
window; so that it was nine o’clock at
night before I had done it.\tskk I then
began and read it as follows.




\head{32pt}{48}{THE FRAGMENT}
\head{24pt}{48}{PARIS}

\vskip 6pt


\tskk NOW, as the notary’s wife disputed
the point with the notary with too much
heat\tskk I wish, said the notary,
(throwing down the parchment) that there
was another notary here only to set down
and attest all this.\tskk 

\tskk And what would you do then,
Monsieur? said she, rising hastily
up.\tskk The notary’s wife was a little
fume of a woman, and the notary thought it
well to avoid a hurricane by a mild
reply.\tskk I would go, answered he, to
bed.\tskk You may go to the devil,
answer’d the notary’s wife.

Now there happening to be but one bed in
the house, the other two rooms being
unfurnished, as is the custom at Paris,
and the notary not caring to lie in the
same bed with a woman who had but that
moment sent him pell mell to the devil,
went forth with his hat and cane and short
cloak, the night being very windy, and
walk’d out, ill at ease, towards the Pont
Neuf.

Of all the bridges which ever were built,
the whole world who have pass’d over the
Pont Neuf must own, that it is the
noblest\tskk the finest,\tskk the
grandest\tskk the lightest,\tskk the
longest\tskk the broadest, that ever
conjoin’d land and land together upon the
face of the terraqueous globe.

[\i{By this it seems as if the author of
the fragment had not been a Frenchman}.]

The worst fault which divines and the
doctors of the Sorbonne can allege against
it is, that if there is but a capfull of
wind in or about Paris, ’tis more
blasphemously \i{sacre Dieu’d} there than
in any other aperture of the whole
city\tskk and with reason good and
cogent, Messieurs; for it comes against
you without crying \i{garde d’eau}, and
with such unpremeditable puffs, that of
the few who cross it with their hats on,
not one in fifty but hazards two livres
and a half, which is its full worth.

The poor notary, just as he was passing by
the sentry, instinctively clapp’d his cane
to the side of it, but in raising it up,
the point of his cane catching hold of the
loop of the sentinel’s hat, hoisted it
over the spikes of the ballustrade clear
into the Seine.\tskk 

\tskk ’\i{Tis an ill wind}, said a
boatman, who catched it, \i{which blows
nobody any good}.

The sentry, being a Gascon, incontinently
twirled up his whiskers, and levell’d his
arquebuss.

Arquebusses in those days went off with
matches; and an old woman’s paper lantern
at the end of the bridge happening to be
blown out, she had borrow’d the sentry’s
match to light it\tskk it gave a moment’s
time for the Gascon’s blood to run cool,
and turn the accident better to his
advantage.\tskk ’\i{Tis an ill wind}, said
he, catching off the notary’s castor, and
legitimating the capture with the
boatman’s adage.

The poor notary crossed the bridge, and
passing along the Rue de Dauphine into the
fauxbourgs of St. Germain, lamented
himself as he walked along in this
manner\tskk 

Luckless man that I am! said the notary,
to be the sport of hurricanes all my
days\tskk to be born to have the storm of
ill language levell’d against me and my
profession wherever I go; to be forced
into marriage by the thunder of the church
to a tempest of a woman\tskk to be driven
forth out of my house by domestic winds,
and despoil’d of my castor by pontific
ones!\tskk to be here, bareheaded, in a
windy night, at the mercy of the ebbs and
flows of accidents!\tskk Where am I to lay
my head?\tskk Miserable man! what wind in
the two-and-thirty points of the whole
compass can blow unto thee, as it does to
the rest of thy fellow-creatures, good?

As the notary was passing on by a dark
passage, complaining in this sort, a voice
call’d out to a girl, to bid her run for
the next notary.\tskk Now the notary being
the next, and availing himself of his
situation, walk’d up the passage to the
door, and passing through an old sort of a
saloon, was usher’d into a large chamber,
dismantled of everything but a long
military pike\tskk a breastplate,\tskk a
rusty old sword, and bandoleer, hung up,
equidistant, in four different places
against the wall.

An old personage who had heretofore been a
gentleman, and unless decay of fortune
taints the blood along with it, was a
gentleman at that time, lay supporting his
head upon his hand in his bed; a little
table with a taper burning was set close
beside it, and close by the table was
placed a chair\tskk the notary sat him
down in it; and pulling out his inkhorn
and a sheet or two of paper which he had
in his pocket, he placed them before him;
and dipping his pen in his ink, and
leaning his breast over the table, he
disposed everything to make the
gentleman’s last will and testament.

Alas!  \i{Monsieur le Notaire}, said the
gentleman, raising himself up a little, I
have nothing to bequeath, which will pay
the expense of bequeathing, except the
history of myself, which I could not die
in peace, unless I left it as a legacy to
the world: the profits arising out of it I
bequeath to you for the pains of taking it
from me.\tskk It is a story so uncommon,
it must be read by all mankind\tskk it
will make the fortunes of your house.\tskk
The notary dipp’d his pen into his
inkhorn.\tskk Almighty Director of every
event in my life! said the old gentleman,
looking up earnestly, and raising his
hands towards heaven\tskk Thou, whose
hand has led me on through such a
labyrinth of strange passages down into
this scene of desolation, assist the
decaying memory of an old, infirm, and
broken-hearted man\tskk direct my tongue
by the spirit of thy eternal truth, that
this stranger may set down nought but what
is written in that BOOK, from whose
records, said he, clasping his hands
together, I am to be condemn’d or
acquitted!\tskk the notary held up the
point of his pen betwixt the taper and his
eye.\tskk 

It is a story, \i{Monsieur le Notaire},
said the gentleman, which will rouse up
every affection in nature\tskk it will
kill the humane, and touch the heart of
Cruelty herself with pity.\tskk 

\tskk The notary was inflamed with a
desire to begin, and put his pen a third
time into his ink-horn\tskk and the old
gentleman, turning a little more towards
the notary, began to dictate his story in
these words\tskk 

\tskk And where is the rest of it, La
Fleur? said I, as he just then enter’d the
room.

\dropcap{W}{hen} La Fleur came up close to
the table, and was made to comprehend what
I wanted, he told me there were only two
other sheets of it, which he had wrapped
round the stalks of a bouquet to keep it
together, which he had presented to the
demoiselle upon the boulevards.\tskk Then
prithee, La Fleur, said I, step back to
her to the Count de B\anon’s hotel, and
see if thou canst get it.\tskk There is no
doubt of it, said La Fleur\tskk and away
he flew.

In a very little time the poor fellow came
back quite out of breath, with deeper
marks of disappointment in his looks than
could arise from the simple irreparability
of the fragment.  \i{Juste Ciel}! in less
than two minutes that the poor fellow had
taken his last tender farewell of her\tskk
his faithless mistress had given his
\i{gage d’amour} to one of the Count’s
footmen\tskk the footman to a young
sempstress\tskk and the sempstress to a

it.\tskk Our misfortunes were involved
together\tskk I gave a sigh,\tskk and La

\stick{\hfill\footnotesize\fnast Nosegay.\hfill}

\tskk How perfidious! cried La Fleur.\tskk
How unlucky! said I.

\tskk I should not have been mortified,

\dropcap{T}{he} man who either disdains or
fears to walk up a dark entry may be an
excellent good man, and fit for a hundred
things, but he will not do to make a good
Sentimental Traveller.\tskk I count little
of the many things I see pass at broad
noonday, in large and open streets.\tskk
Nature is shy, and hates to act before
spectators; but in such an unobserved
corner you sometimes see a single short
scene of hers worth all the sentiments of
a dozen French plays compounded
together\tskk and yet they are absolutely
fine\tskk and whenever I have a more
brilliant affair upon my hands than
common, as they suit a preacher just as
well as a hero, I generally make my sermon
out of ’em\tskk and for the text,\tskk
\lqq Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and
Pamphylia,\rqq \tskk is as good as any one in
the Bible.

There is a long dark passage issuing out
from the Opera Comique into a narrow
street; ’tis trod by a few who humbly wait
for a \i{fiacre}, {649} or wish to get off
quietly o’foot when the opera is done.  At
the end of it, towards the theatre, ’tis
lighted by a small candle, the light of
which is almost lost before you get
half-way down, but near the door\tskk ’tis
more for ornament than use: you see it as
a fixed star of the least magnitude; it
burns\tskk but does little good to the
world, that we know of.

{649}  Hackney coach.

In returning along this passage, I
discerned, as I approached within five or
six paces of the door, two ladies standing
arm-in-arm with their backs against the
wall, waiting, as I imagined, for a
\i{fiacre}\tskk as they were next the
door, I thought they had a prior right; so
edged myself up within a yard or little
more of them, and quietly took my
stand.\tskk I was in black, and scarce
seen.

The lady next me was a tall lean figure of
a woman, of about thirty-six; the other of
the same size and make, of about forty:
there was no mark of wife or widow in any
one part of either of them\tskk they
seem’d to be two upright vestal sisters,
unsapped by caresses, unbroke in upon by
tender salutations.\tskk I could have
wish’d to have made them happy\tskk their
happiness was destin’d that night, to come
from another quarter.

A low voice, with a good turn of
expression, and sweet cadence at the end
of it, begg’d for a twelve-sous piece
betwixt them, for the love of heaven.  I
thought it singular that a beggar should
fix the quota of an alms\tskk and that the
sum should be twelve times as much as what
is usually given in the dark.\tskk They
both seemed astonished at it as much as
myself.\tskk Twelve sous! said one.\tskk A
twelve-sous piece! said the other\tskk
and made no reply.

The poor man said, he knew not how to ask
less of ladies of their rank; and bow’d
down his head to the ground.

Poo! said they\tskk we have no money.

The beggar remained silent for a moment or
two, and renew’d his supplication.

\tskk Do not, my fair young ladies, said
he, stop your good ears against me.\tskk
Upon my word, honest man! said the
younger, we have no change.\tskk Then God
bless you, said the poor man, and multiply
those joys which you can give to others
without change!\tskk I observed the elder
sister put her hand into her pocket.\tskk
I’ll see, said she, if I have a sous.  A
sous! give twelve, said the supplicant;
Nature has been bountiful to you, be
bountiful to a poor man.

\tskk I would friend, with all my heart,
said the younger, if I had it.

My fair charitable! said he, addressing
himself to the elder\tskk what is it but
your goodness and humanity which makes
your bright eyes so sweet, that they
outshine the morning even in this dark
passage? and what was it which made the
Marquis de Santerre and his brother say so
much of you both as they just passed by?

The two ladies seemed much affected; and
impulsively, at the same time they both
put their hands into their pocket, and
each took out a twelve-sous piece.

The contest betwixt them and the poor
supplicant was no more\tskk it was
continued betwixt themselves, which of the
two should give the twelve-sous piece in
charity\tskk and, to end the dispute,
they both gave it together, and the man
went away.

\initial{I}{stepped} hastily after him: it
was the very man whose success in asking
charity of the women before the door of
the hotel had so puzzled me\tskk and I
found at once his secret, or at least the
basis of it\tskk ’twas flattery.

Delicious essence! how refreshing art thou
to Nature! how strongly are all its powers
and all its weaknesses on thy side! how
sweetly dost thou mix with the blood, and
help it through the most difficult and
tortuous passages to the heart!

The poor man, as he was not straiten’d for
time, had given it here in a larger dose:
’tis certain he had a way of bringing it
into a less form, for the many sudden
cases he had to do with in the streets:
but how he contrived to correct, sweeten,
concentre, and qualify it\tskk I vex not
my spirit with the enquiry\tskk it is
enough the beggar gained two twelve-sous
pieces\tskk and they can best tell the
rest, who have gained much greater matters
by it.

\dropcap{W}{e} get forwards in the world,

receiving them; you take a withering twig,

Monsieur le Count de B\anon, merely
because he had done me one kindness in the
affair of my passport, would go on and do
me another, the few days he was at Paris,
in making me known to a few people of
rank; and they were to present me to
others, and so on.

I had got master of my \i{secret} just in
time to turn these honours to some little
account; otherwise, as is commonly the
case, I should have dined or supp’d a
single time or two round, and then, by
\i{translating} French looks and attitudes
into plain English, I should presently
have seen, that I had hold of the
\i{couvert} {652} of some more
entertaining guest; and in course should
have resigned all my places one after
another, merely upon the principle that I
could not keep them.\tskk As it was,
things did not go much amiss.

{652}  Plate, napkin, knife, fork and
spoon.

I had the honour of being introduced to
the old Marquis de B\tskk : in days of
yore he had signalized himself by some
small feats of chivalry in the \i{Cour
d’Amour}, and had dress’d himself out to
the idea of tilts and tournaments ever
since.\tskk The Marquis de B\tskk  wish’d
to have it thought the affair was
somewhere else than in his brain.  \lqq He
could like to take a trip to England,\rqq\ and
asked much of the English ladies.\tskk
Stay where you are, I beseech you,
Monsieur le Marquis, said I.\tskk \i{Les
Messieurs Anglois} can scarce get a kind
look from them as it is.\tskk The Marquis
invited me to supper.

Monsieur P\tskk , the farmer-general, was
just as inquisitive about our taxes.  They
were very considerable, he heard.\tskk If
we knew but how to collect them, said I,
making him a low bow.

I could never have been invited to Mons.
P\tskk ’s concerts upon any other terms.

I had been misrepresented to Madame de
Q\tskk  as an \i{esprit}.\tskk Madame de
Q\tskk  was an \i{esprit} herself: she
burnt with impatience to see me, and hear
me talk.  I had not taken my seat, before
I saw she did not care a sous whether I
had any wit or no\tskk I was let in, to
be convinced she had.  I call heaven to
witness I never once opened the door of my
lips.

Madame de V\tskk  vow’d to every creature
she met\tskk \lqq She had never had a more
improving conversation with a man in her
life.\rqq 

There are three epochas in the empire of a
French woman.\tskk She is coquette\tskk
then deist\tskk then \i{dévote}: the
empire during these is never lost\tskk
she only changes her subjects when
thirty-five years and more have unpeopled
her dominion of the slaves of love, she
re-peoples it with slaves of
infidelity\tskk and then with the slaves
of the church.

Madame de V\tskk  was vibrating betwixt
the first of those epochas: the colour of
the rose was fading fast away\tskk she
ought to have been a deist five years
before the time I had the honour to pay my
first visit.

She placed me upon the same sofa with her,
for the sake of disputing the point of
religion more closely.\tskk In short
Madame de V\tskk  told me she believed
nothing.\tskk I told Madame de V\tskk  it
might be her principle, but I was sure it
could not be her interest to level the
outworks, without which I could not
conceive how such a citadel as hers could
be defended\tskk that there was not a
more dangerous thing in the world than for
a beauty to be a deist\tskk that it was a
debt I owed my creed not to conceal it
from her\tskk that I had not been five
minutes sat upon the sofa beside her, but
I had begun to form designs\tskk and what
is it, but the sentiments of religion, and
the persuasion they had excited in her
breast, which could have check’d them as
they rose up?

We are not adamant, said I, taking hold of
her hand\tskk and there is need of all
restraints, till age in her own time
steals in and lays them on us.\tskk But my
dear lady, said I, kissing her hand\tskk
’tis too\tskk too soon.

I declare I had the credit all over Paris
of unperverting Madame de V\tskk .\tskk
She affirmed to Monsieur D\tskk  and the
Abbé M\tskk , that in one half hour I had
said more for revealed religion, than all
their Encyclopædia had said against
it.\tskk I was listed directly into Madame
de V\tskk ’s \i{coterie}\tskk and she put
off the epocha of deism for two years.

I remember it was in this \i{coterie}, in
the middle of a discourse, in which I was
shewing the necessity of a \i{first}
cause, when the young Count de Faineant
took me by the hand to the farthest corner
of the room, to tell me my \i{solitaire}
was pinn’d too straight about my
neck.\tskk It should be \i{plus badinant},
said the Count, looking down upon his
own\tskk but a word, Monsieur Yorick,
\i{to the wise}\tskk 

And \i{from the wise}, Monsieur le Count,
replied I, making him a bow\tskk \i{is
enough}.

The Count de Faineant embraced me with
more ardour than ever I was embraced by
mortal man.

For three weeks together I was of every
man’s opinion I met.\tskk \i{Pardi}! \i{ce
Monsieur Yorick a autant d’esprit que nous
autres}.\tskk \i{Il raisonne bien}, said
another.\tskk \i{C’est un bon enfant},
said a third.\tskk And at this price I
could have eaten and drank and been merry
all the days of my life at Paris; but
’twas a dishonest \i{reckoning}\tskk I
grew ashamed of it.\tskk It was the gain
of a slave\tskk every sentiment of honour
revolted against it\tskk the higher I
got, the more was I forced upon my
\i{beggarly system}\tskk the better the
\i{coterie}\tskk the more children of
Art\tskk I languish’d for those of
Nature: and one night, after a most vile
prostitution of myself to half a dozen
different people, I grew sick\tskk went
to bed\tskk order’d La Fleur to get me
horses in the morning to set out for
Italy.

\initial{I}{never} felt what the distress
of plenty was in any one shape till
now\tskk to travel it through the
Bourbonnois, the sweetest part of
France\tskk in the heyday of the vintage,
when Nature is pouring her abundance into
every one’s lap, and every eye is lifted
up\tskk a journey, through each step of
which Music beats time to \i{Labour}, and
all her children are rejoicing as they
carry in their clusters: to pass through
this with my affections flying out, and
kindling at every group before me\tskk
and every one of them was pregnant with
adventures.\tskk 

Just heaven!\tskk it would fill up twenty
volumes\tskk and alas! I have but a few
small pages left of this to crowd it
into\tskk and half of these must be taken
up with the poor Maria my friend, Mr.
Shandy, met with near Moulines.

The story he had told of that disordered
maid affected me not a little in the
reading; but when I got within the
neighbourhood where she lived, it returned
so strong into the mind, that I could not
resist an impulse which prompted me to go
half a league out of the road, to the
village where her parents dwelt, to
enquire after her.

’Tis going, I own, like the Knight of the
Woeful Countenance in quest of melancholy
adventures.  But I know not how it is, but
I am never so perfectly conscious of the
existence of a soul within me, as when I
am entangled in them.

The old mother came to the door; her looks
told me the story before she open’d her
mouth.\tskk She had lost her husband; he
had died, she said, of anguish, for the
loss of Maria’s senses, about a month
before.\tskk She had feared at first, she
added, that it would have plunder’d her
poor girl of what little understanding was
left\tskk but, on the contrary, it had
brought her more to herself\tskk still,
she could not rest.\tskk Her poor
daughter, she said, crying, was wandering
somewhere about the road.

Why does my pulse beat languid as I write
this? and what made La Fleur, whose heart
seem’d only to be tuned to joy, to pass
the back of his hand twice across his
eyes, as the woman stood and told it?  I
beckoned to the postilion to turn back
into the road.

When we had got within half a league of
Moulines, at a little opening in the road
leading to a thicket, I discovered poor
Maria sitting under a poplar.  She was
sitting with her elbow in her lap, and her
head leaning on one side within her
hand\tskk a small brook ran at the foot
of the tree.

I bid the postilion go on with the chaise
to Moulines\tskk and La Fleur to bespeak
my supper\tskk and that I would walk
after him.

She was dress’d in white, and much as my
friend described her, except that her hair
hung loose, which before was twisted
within a silk net.\tskk She had superadded
likewise to her jacket, a pale green
ribband, which fell across her shoulder to
the waist; at the end of which hung her
pipe.\tskk Her goat had been as faithless
as her lover; and she had got a little dog
in lieu of him, which she had kept tied by
a string to her girdle: as I looked at her
dog, she drew him towards her with the
string.\tskk \lqq Thou shalt not leave me,
Sylvio,\rqq\ said she.  I look’d in Maria’s
eyes and saw she was thinking more of her
father than of her lover, or her little
goat; for, as she utter’d them, the tears
trickled down her cheeks.

I sat down close by her; and Maria let me
wipe them away as they fell, with my
handkerchief.\tskk I then steep’d it in my
own\tskk and then in hers,\tskk and then
in mine\tskk and then I wip’d hers
again\tskk and as I did it, I felt such
undescribable emotions within me, as I am
sure could not be accounted for from any
combinations of matter and motion.

I am positive I have a soul; nor can all
the books with which materialists have
pester’d the world ever convince me to the
contrary.

\dropcap{W}{hen} Maria had come a little
to herself, I ask’d her if she remembered
a pale thin person of a man, who had sat
down betwixt her and her goat about two
years before?  She said she was unsettled
much at that time, but remembered it upon
two accounts\tskk that ill as she was,
she saw the person pitied her; and next,
that her goat had stolen his handkerchief,
and she had beat him for the theft\tskk
she had wash’d it, she said, in the brook,
and kept it ever since in her pocket to
restore it to him in case she should ever
see him again, which, she added, he had
half promised her.  As she told me this,
she took the handkerchief out of her
pocket to let me see it; she had folded it
up neatly in a couple of vine leaves, tied
round with a tendril\tskk on opening it,
I saw an S. marked in one of the corners.

She had since that, she told me, stray’d
as far as Rome, and walk’d round St.
Peter’s once\tskk and return’d back;\tskk
that she found her way alone across the
Apennines\tskk had travell’d over all
Lombardy, without money\tskk and through
the flinty roads of Savoy without
shoes\tskk how she had borne it, and how
she had got supported, she could not
tell\tskk but \i{God tempers the wind},
said Maria, \i{to the shorn lamb}.

Shorn indeed! and to the quick, said I:
and wast thou in my own land, where I have
a cottage, I would take thee to it, and
shelter thee: thou shouldst eat of my own
bread and drink of my own cup\tskk I
would be kind to thy Sylvio\tskk in all
thy weaknesses and wanderings I would seek
after thee and bring thee back\tskk when
the sun went down I would say my prayers:
and when I had done thou shouldst play thy
evening song upon thy pipe, nor would the
incense of my sacrifice be worse accepted
for entering heaven along with that of a
broken heart!

Nature melted within me, as I utter’d
this; and Maria observing, as I took out
my handkerchief, that it was steep’d too
much already to be of use, would needs go
wash it in the stream.\tskk And where will
you dry it, Maria? said I.\tskk I’ll dry
it in my bosom, said she\tskk ’twill do
me good.

And is your heart still so warm, Maria?
said I.

I touch’d upon the string on which hung
all her sorrows\tskk she look’d with
wistful disorder for some time in my face;
and then, without saying any thing, took
her pipe and play’d her service to the
Virgin.\tskk The string I had touched
ceased to vibrate\tskk in a moment or two
Maria returned to herself\tskk let her
pipe fall\tskk and rose up.

And where are you going, Maria? said
I.\tskk She said, to Moulines.\tskk Let us
go, said I, together.\tskk Maria put her
arm within mine, and lengthening the
string, to let the dog follow\tskk in
that order we enter’d Moulines.

\dropcap{T}{hough} I hate salutations and
greetings in the market-place, yet, when
we got into the middle of this, I stopp’d
to take my last look and last farewell of
Maria.

Maria, though not tall, was nevertheless
of the first order of fine forms\tskk
affliction had touched her looks with
something that was scarce earthly\tskk
still she was feminine\tskk and so much
was there about her of all that the heart
wishes, or the eye looks for in woman,
that could the traces be ever worn out of
her brain, and those of Eliza out of mine,
she should \i{not only eat of my bread and
drink of my own cup}, but Maria should lie
in my bosom, and be unto me as a daughter.

Adieu, poor luckless maiden!\tskk Imbibe
the oil and wine which the compassion of a
stranger, as he journeyeth on his way, now
pours into thy wounds\tskk the Being, who
has twice bruised thee, can only bind them
up for ever.




\head{32pt}{48}{THE BOURBONNNOIS}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{T}{here} was nothing from which I
had painted out for my self so joyous a
riot of the affections, as in this journey
in the vintage, through this part of
France; but pressing through this gate, of
sorrow to it, my sufferings have totally
unfitted me.  In every scene of festivity,
I saw Maria in the background of the
piece, sitting pensive under her poplar;
and I had got almost to Lyons before I was
able to cast a shade across her.

\tskk Dear Sensibility! source inexhausted
of all that’s precious in our joys, or
costly in our sorrows! thou chainest thy
martyr down upon his bed of straw\tskk and
’tis thou who lift’st him up to
Heaven!\tskk Eternal Fountain of our
feelings!\tskk ’tis here I trace thee\tskk
and this is thy \lqq \i{divinity which stirs
within me};\rqq \tskk not that, in some sad
and sickening moments, \lqq \i{my soul shrinks
back upon herself}, \i{and startles at
destruction};\rqq \tskk mere pomp of
words!\tskk but that I feel some generous
joys and generous cares beyond
myself\tskk all comes from thee,
great\tskk great SENSORIUM of the world!
which vibrates, if a hair of our heads but
falls upon the ground, in the remotest
desert of thy creation.\tskk Touch’d with
thee, Eugenius draws my curtain when I
languish\tskk hears my tale of symptoms,
and blames the weather for the disorder of
his nerves.  Thou giv’st a portion of it
sometimes to the roughest peasant who
traverses the bleakest mountains\tskk he
finds the lacerated lamb of another’s
flock.\tskk This moment I behold him
leaning with his head against his crook,
with piteous inclination looking down upon
it!\tskk Oh! had I come one moment sooner!
it bleeds to death!\tskk his gentle heart
bleeds with it.\tskk 

Peace to thee, generous swain!\tskk I see
thou walkest off with anguish\tskk but
thy joys shall balance it\tskk for, happy
is thy cottage\tskk and happy is the
sharer of it\tskk and happy are the lambs
which sport about you!




\head{32pt}{48}{THE SUPPER}

\vskip 6pt


\initial{A}{shoe} coming loose from the
fore foot of the thill-horse, at the
beginning of the ascent of mount Taurira,
the postilion dismounted, twisted the shoe
off, and put it in his pocket; as the
ascent was of five or six miles, and that
horse our main dependence, I made a point
of having the shoe fastened on again, as
well as we could; but the postilion had
thrown away the nails, and the hammer in
the chaise box being of no great use
without them, I submitted to go on.

He had not mounted half a mile higher,
when, coming to a flinty piece of road,
the poor devil lost a second shoe, and
from off his other fore foot.  I then got
out of the chaise in good earnest; and
seeing a house about a quarter of a mile
to the left hand, with a great deal to do
I prevailed upon the postilion to turn up
to it.  The look of the house, and of
every thing about it, as we drew nearer,
soon reconciled me to the disaster.\tskk
It was a little farm-house, surrounded
with about twenty acres of vineyard, about
as much corn\tskk and close to the house,
on one side, was a \i{potagerie} of an
acre and a half, full of everything which
could make plenty in a French peasant’s
house\tskk and, on the other side, was a
little wood, which furnished wherewithal
to dress it.  It was about eight in the
evening when I got to the house\tskk so I
left the postilion to manage his point as
he could\tskk and, for mine, I walked
directly into the house.

The family consisted of an old grey-headed
man and his wife, with five or six sons
and sons-in-law, and their several wives,
and a joyous genealogy out of them.

They were all sitting down together to
their lentil-soup; a large wheaten loaf
was in the middle of the table; and a
flagon of wine at each end of it promised
joy through the stages of the repast\tskk
’twas a feast of love.

The old man rose up to meet me, and with a
respectful cordiality would have me sit
down at the table; my heart was set down
the moment I enter’d the room; so I sat
down at once like a son of the family; and
to invest myself in the character as
speedily as I could, I instantly borrowed
the old man’s knife, and taking up the
loaf, cut myself a hearty luncheon; and,
as I did it, I saw a testimony in every
eye, not only of an honest welcome, but of
a welcome mix’d with thanks that I had not
seem’d to doubt it.

Was it this? or tell me, Nature, what else
it was that made this morsel so
sweet\tskk and to what magic I owe it,
that the draught I took of their flagon
was so delicious with it, that they remain
upon my palate to this hour?

If the supper was to my taste\tskk the
grace which followed it was much more so.




\head{32pt}{48}{THE GRACE}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{W}{hen} supper was over, the old
man gave a knock upon the table with the
haft of his knife, to bid them prepare for
the dance: the moment the signal was
given, the women and girls ran altogether
into a back apartment to tie up their
hair\tskk and the young men to the door
to wash their faces, and change their
sabots; and in three minutes every soul
was ready upon a little esplanade before
the house to begin.\tskk The old man and
his wife came out last, and placing me
betwixt them, sat down upon a sofa of turf
by the door.

The old man had some fifty years ago been
no mean performer upon the
\i{vielle}\tskk and at the age he was
then of, touch’d it well enough for the
purpose.  His wife sung now and then a
little to the tune\tskk then
intermitted\tskk and join’d her old man
again, as their children and
grand-children danced before them.

It was not till the middle of the second
dance, when, from some pauses in the
movements, wherein they all seemed to look
up, I fancied I could distinguish an
elevation of spirit different from that
which is the cause or the effect of simple
jollity.  In a word, I thought I beheld
\i{Religion} mixing in the dance\tskk
but, as I had never seen her so engaged, I
should have look’d upon it now as one of
the illusions of an imagination which is
eternally misleading me, had not the old
man, as soon as the dance ended, said,
that this was their constant way; and that
all his life long he had made it a rule,
after supper was over, to call out his
family to dance and rejoice; believing, he
said, that a cheerful and contented mind
was the best sort of thanks to heaven that
an illiterate peasant could pay\tskk 

Or a learned prelate either, said I.




\head{32pt}{48}{THE CASE OF DELICACY}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{W}{hen} you have gained the top
of Mount Taurira, you run presently down
to Lyons\tskk adieu, then, to all rapid
movements!  ’Tis a journey of caution; and
it fares better with sentiments, not to be
in a hurry with them; so I contracted with
a \i{voiturin} to take his time with a
couple of mules, and convoy me in my own
chaise safe to Turin, through Savoy.

Poor, patient, quiet, honest people! fear
not: your poverty, the treasury of your
simple virtues, will not be envied you by
the world, nor will your valleys be
invaded by it.\tskk Nature! in the midst
of thy disorders, thou art still friendly
to the scantiness thou hast created: with
all thy great works about thee, little
hast thou left to give, either to the
scythe or to the sickle\tskk but to that
little thou grantest safety and
protection; and sweet are the dwellings
which stand so shelter’d.

Let the way-worn traveller vent his
complaints upon the sudden turns and
dangers of your roads\tskk your
rocks\tskk your precipices;\tskk the
difficulties of getting up\tskk the
horrors of getting down\tskk mountains
impracticable\tskk and cataracts, which
roll down great stones from their summits,
and block his road up.\tskk The peasants
had been all day at work in removing a
fragment of this kind between St. Michael
and Madane; and, by the time my
\i{voiturin} got to the place, it wanted
full two hours of completing before a
passage could any how be gain’d: there was
nothing but to wait with patience\tskk
’twas a wet and tempestuous night; so that
by the delay, and that together, the
\i{voiturin} found himself obliged to put
up five miles short of his stage at a
little decent kind of an inn by the
roadside.

I forthwith took possession of my
bedchamber\tskk got a good fire\tskk
order’d supper; and was thanking heaven it
was no worse, when a \i{voiturin} arrived
with a lady in it and her servant maid.

As there was no other bed-chamber in the
house, the hostess\tskk without much
nicety, led them into mine, telling them,
as she usher’d them in, that there was
nobody in it but an English
gentleman\tskk that there were two good
beds in it, and a closet within the room
which held another.  The accent in which
she spoke of this third bed, did not say
much for it\tskk however, she said there
were three beds and but three people, and
she durst say, the gentleman would do
anything to accommodate matters.\tskk I
left not the lady a moment to make a
conjecture about it\tskk so instantly made
a declaration that I would do anything in
my power.

As this did not amount to an absolute
surrender of my bed-chamber, I still felt
myself so much the proprietor, as to have
a right to do the honours of it\tskk so I
desired the lady to sit down\tskk pressed
her into the warmest seat\tskk called for
more wood\tskk desired the hostess to
enlarge the plan of the supper, and to
favour us with the very best wine.

The lady had scarce warm’d herself five
minutes at the fire, before she began to
turn her head back, and give a look at the
beds; and the oftener she cast her eyes
that way, the more they return’d
perplexd\tskk I felt for her\tskk and for
myself: for in a few minutes, what by her
looks, and the case itself, I found myself
as much embarrassed as it was possible the
lady could be herself.

That the beds we were to lie in were in
one and the same room, was enough simply
by itself to have excited all this\tskk
but the position of them, for they stood
parallel, and so very close to each other
as only to allow space for a small wicker
chair betwixt them, rendered the affair
still more oppressive to us\tskk they
were fixed up moreover near the fire; and
the projection of the chimney on one side,
and a large beam which cross’d the room on
the other, formed a kind of recess for
them that was no way favourable to the
nicety of our sensations\tskk if anything
could have added to it, it was that the
two beds were both of them so very small,
as to cut us off from every idea of the
lady and the maid lying together; which in
either of them, could it have been
feasible, my lying beside them, though a
thing not to be wish’d, yet there was
nothing in it so terrible which the
imagination might not have pass’d over
without torment.

As for the little room within, it offer’d
little or no consolation to us: ’twas a
damp, cold closet, with a half dismantled
window-shutter, and with a window which
had neither glass nor oil paper in it to
keep out the tempest of the night.  I did
not endeavour to stifle my cough when the
lady gave a peep into it; so it reduced
the case in course to this
alternative\tskk That the lady should
sacrifice her health to her feelings, and
take up with the closet herself, and
abandon the bed next mine to her
maid\tskk or that the girl should take
the closet, \&c., \&c.

The lady was a Piedmontese of about
thirty, with a glow of health in her
cheeks.  The maid was a Lyonoise of
twenty, and as brisk and lively a French
girl as ever moved.\tskk There were
difficulties every way\tskk and the
obstacle of the stone in the road, which
brought us into the distress, great as it
appeared whilst the peasants were removing
it, was but a pebble to what lay in our
ways now.\tskk I have only to add, that it
did not lessen the weight which hung upon
our spirits, that we were both too
delicate to communicate what we felt to
each other upon the occasion.

We sat down to supper; and had we not had
more generous wine to it than a little inn
in Savoy could have furnish’d, our tongues
had been tied up, till necessity herself
had set them at liberty\tskk but the lady
having a few bottles of Burgundy in her
voiture, sent down her \i{fille de
chambre} for a couple of them; so that by
the time supper was over, and we were left
alone, we felt ourselves inspired with a
strength of mind sufficient to talk, at
least, without reserve upon our situation.
We turn’d it every way, and debated and
considered it in all kinds of lights in
the course of a two hours’ negotiation; at
the end of which the articles were settled
finally betwixt us, and stipulated for in
form and manner of a treaty of peace\tskk
and I believe with as much religion and
good faith on both sides as in any treaty
which has yet had the honour of being
handed down to posterity.

They were as follow\tskk 

First, as the right of the bed-chamber is
in Monsieur\tskk and he thinking the bed
next to the fire to be the warmest, he
insists upon the concession on the lady’s
side of taking up with it.

Granted, on the part of Madame; with a
proviso, That as the curtains of that bed
are of a flimsy transparent cotton, and
appear likewise too scanty to draw close,
that the Fille de Chambre shall fasten
up the opening, either by corking pins, or
needle and thread, in such manner as shall
be deem’d a sufficient barrier on the side
of Monsieur.

2dly.  It is required on the part of
Madame, that Monsieur shall lie the whole
night through in his \i{robe de chambre}.

Rejected: inasmuch as Monsieur is not
worth a \i{robe de chambre}; he having
nothing in his portmanteau but six shirts
and a black silk pair of breeches.

The mentioning the silk pair of breeches
made an intire change of the article\tskk
for the breeches were accepted as an
equivalent for the \i{robe de chambre};
and so it was stipulated and agreed upon,
that I should lie in my black silk
breeches all night.

3dly.  It was insisted upon and stipulated
for by the lady, that after Monsieur was
got to bed, and the candle and fire
extinguished, that Monsieur should not
speak one single word the whole night.

Granted; provided Monsieur’s saying his
prayers might not be deemed an infraction
of the treaty.

There was but one point forgot in this
treaty, and that was the manner in which
the lady and myself should be obliged to
undress and get to bed\tskk there was but
one way of doing it, and that I leave to
the reader to devise; protesting as I do
it, that if it is not the most delicate in
nature, ’tis the fault of his own
imagination\tskk against which this is
not my first complaint.

Now, when we were got to bed, whether it
was the novelty of the situation, or what
it was, I know not; but so it was, I could
not shut my eyes; I tried this side, and
that, and turn’d and turn’d again, till a
full hour after midnight; when Nature and
patience both wearing out\tskk O, my God!
said I.

\tskk You have broke the treaty, Monsieur,
said the lady, who had no more slept than
myself.\tskk I begg’d a thousand
pardons\tskk but insisted it was no more
than an ejaculation.  She maintained ’twas
an intire infraction of the treaty\tskk I
maintain’d it was provided for in the
clause of the third article.

The lady would by no means give up her
point, though she weaken’d her barrier by
it; for in the warmth of the dispute, I
could hear two or three corking pins fall
out of the curtain to the ground.

Upon my word and honour, Madame, said
I\tskk stretching my arm out of bed by
way of asseveration.\tskk 

(I was going to have added, that I would
not have trespassed against the remotest
idea of decorum for the world)\tskk 

But the Fille de Chambre hearing there
were words between us, and fearing that
hostilities would ensue in course, had
crept silently out of her closet, and it
being totally dark, had stolen so close to
our beds, that she had got herself into
the narrow passage which separated them,
and had advanced so far up as to be in a
line betwixt her mistress and me\tskk 

So that when I stretch’d out my
hand, I caught hold of the Fille de
Chambre’s
