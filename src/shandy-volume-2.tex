\initial[lines=3,lraise=0,nindent=0.6pt]{I}{Have} 
begun a new book, on purpose\break
that I might have room enough to\break 
\tight{explain the nature of the perplexities}\break
\stick{in which my uncle \toby was involved,}
\stick{from the many discourses and interroga-}
\stick{tions about the siege of \i{Namur}, where}
he received his wound.

I must remind the reader, in case he\break
\stick{has read the history of King \i{William}’s}
\natch{wars,} 
\stick{wars,\tsk but if he has not,\tsk I then inform}
\stick{him, that one of the most memorable at-}
\stick{tacks in that siege, was that which was}
\stick{made by the \i{English} and \i{Dutch} upon the}
\stick{point of the advanced counterscarp, be-}
\stick{tween the gate of \i{St.\@ Nicolas}, which inclo-}
\stick{sed the great sluice or water-stop, where} 
\stick{the \i{English} were terribly exposed to the}
\stick{shot of the counter-guard and demi-}
\stick{bastion of \i{St.\@ Roch:} The issue of which}
\stick{hot dispute, in three words, was this;}
\stick{That the \i{Dutch} lodged themselves upon}
\stick{the counter-guard,\tsk and that the \i{English}} 
\stick{made themselves masters of the covered}
\stick{way before \i{St.\@ Nicolas}’\/s gate, notwith-}
\stick{standing the gallantry of the \i{French} offi-}
\stick{cers, who exposed themselves upon the}
glacis sword in hand.

As this was the principal attack of\break
\stick{which my uncle \toby was an eye-witness}
\natch{at} 
\stick{at \i{Namur},\tsh the army of the besiegers}
\stick{being cut off, by the confluence of the}
\stick{\i{Maes} and \i{Sambre}, from seeing much of}
\stick{each other’s operations,\tsk my uncle \toby}
\stick{was generally more eloquent and parti-}
\stick{cular in his account of it; and the many}
\stick{perplexities he was in, arose out of the}
\stick{almost insurmountable difficulties he}
\stick{found in telling his story intelligibly,}
\stick{and giving such clear ideas of the differ-}
\stick{ences and distinctions between the scarp} 
\stick{and counterscarp,\tsh the glacis and co-}
\stick{vered way,\tsh the half-moon and rave-}
\stick{lin,\tsh as to make his company fully}
\stick{comprehend where and what he was} 
about.

Writers themselves are too apt to con-\break
\stick{found these terms;\tsh so that you will}
\stick{the less wonder, if in his endeavours to}
\stick{explain them, and in opposition to ma-}
\natch{ny}
\stick{ny misconceptions, that my uncle \toby}
\stick{did oft times puzzle his visiters, and}
sometimes himself too.

To speak the truth, unless the compa-\break
\stick{ny my father led up stairs were tolerably}
\stick{clear-headed, or my uncle \toby was in}
\stick{one of his best explanatory moods, ’twas}
\stick{a difficult thing, do what he could, to}
keep the discourse free from obscurity.

What rendered the account of this\break
\stick{affair the more intricate to my uncle}
\stick{\toby, was this,\tsk that in the attack of the}
\stick{counterscarp before the gate of \i{St.\@ Ni-}}
\stick{\i{colas}, extending itself from the bank of}
\stick{the \i{Maes}, quite up to the great water-}
\stick{stop;\tsk the ground was cut and cross-cut}
\stick{with such a multitude of dykes, drains,} 
\stick{rivulets, and sluices, on all sides,\tsk and} 
\stick{he would get so sadly bewilder’d and set}
\natch{fast}
\stick{fast amongst them, that frequently he}
\stick{could neither get backwards or for-}
\stick{wards to save his life; and was oft times}
\stick{obliged to give up the attack upon that} 
very account only.

These perplexing rebuffs gave my\break
\stick{uncle \i{Toby Shandy} more perturbations}
\stick{than you would imagine; and as my}
\stick{father’s kindness to him was continually}
\stick{dragging up fresh friends and fresh in-} 
\stick{quirers,\tsk he had but a very uneasy task} 
of it.

No doubt my uncle \toby had great
\stick{command of himself,\tsk and could guard} 
\stick{appearances, I believe, as well as most}
\stick{men;\tsk yet any one may imagine, that}
\stick{when he could not retreat out of the ra-}
\stick{velin without getting into the half-moon,}
\stick{or get out of the covered way without}
\natch{falling}
\stick{falling down the counterscarp, nor cross} 
\stick{the dyke without danger of slipping into}
\stick{the ditch, but that he must have fretted}
\stick{and fumed inwardly:\tsk He did so;\tsk and}
\stick{these little and hourly vexations, which} 
\stick{may seem trifling and of no account to} 
\stick{the man who has not read \i{Hippocrates},}
\stick{yet, whoever has read \i{Hippocrates}, or}
\stick{Dr.\@ \i{James Mackenzie}, and has considered}
\stick{well the effects which the passions and}
\stick{affections of the mind have upon the di-}
\stick{gestion,\tsk (Why not of a wound as well} 
\stick{as of a dinner?)\tsk may easily conceive} 
\stick{what sharp paroxisms and exacerbations} 
\stick{of his wound my uncle \toby must have}
undergone upon that score only.

\tsk My uncle \toby could not philoso-\break
\stick{phize upon it;\tsk ’twas enough he felt it}
\stick{was so,\tsk and having sustained the pain}
\stick{and sorrows of it for three months toge-}
\natch{ther,}
\stick{ther, he was resolved some way or other} 
to extricate himself.

He was one morning lying upon his\break
\stick{back in his bed, the anguish and nature}
\stick{of the wound upon his groin suffering} 
\stick{him to lye in no other position, when a}
\stick{thought came into his head, that if he}
\stick{could purchase such a thing, and have it}
\stick{pasted down upon a board, as a large}
\stick{map of the fortifications of the town and}
\stick{citadel of \i{Namur}, with its environs, it}
\stick{might be a means of giving him ease.\tsk}
\stick{I take notice of his desire to have the}
\stick{environs along with the town and cita-}
\stick{del, for this reason,\tsk because my uncle} 
\stick{\toby's wound was got in one of the tra-}
\stick{verses, about thirty toises from the re-}
\stick{turning angle of the trench, opposite to}
\stick{the salient angle of the demi-bastion of}
\stick{\i{St.\@ Roch};\tsh so that he was pretty con-}
\natch{fident}
\stick{fident he could stick a pin upon the iden-}
\stick{tical spot of ground where he was stand-}
ing in when the stone struck him.

All this succeeded to his wishes, and\break
\stick{not only freed him from a world of sad} 
\stick{explanations, but, in the end, it prov’d}
\stick{the happy means, as you will read, of}
\stick{procuring my uncle \toby his \s{Hobby-}}
\s{Horse}.

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  II.}

\dropcap{T}{here} is nothing so foolish, when\break
you are at the expence of making\break
\stick{an entertainment of this kind, as to or-}
\stick{der things so badly, as to let your cri-}
\stick{ticks and gentry of refined taste run it}
\stick{down: Nor is there any thing so likely}
\natch{to}
\stick{to make them do it, as that of leaving}
\stick{them out of the party, or, what is full as} 
\stick{offensive, of bestowing your attention}
\stick{upon the rest of your guests in so parti-}
\stick{cular a way, as if there was no such}
\stick{thing as a critick (\,by occupation\,) at}
table.

\tsh I guard against both; for, in\break
\stick{the first place, I have left half a dozen}
\stick{places purposely open for them;\tsk and,}
\stick{in the next place, I pay them all court,\tsk}
\stick{Gentlemen, I kiss your hands,\tsh I pro-}
\stick{test no company could give me half the}
\stick{pleasure,\tsk by my soul I am glad to see}
\stick{you,\tsh I beg only you will make no}
\stick{strangers of yourselves, but sit down}
\stick{without any ceremony, and fall on hear-}
tily.\patch{I}

I said I had left six places, and I was\break
\stick{upon the point of carrying my complai-}
\stick{sance so far, as to have left a seventh}
\stick{open for them,\tsk and in this very spot I}
\stick{stand on; but being told by a critick,}
\stick{(tho’ not by occupation,\tsk but by nature)} 
\stick{that I had acquitted myself well enough,}
\stick{I shall fill it up directly, hoping, in the} 
\stick{mean time, that I shall be able to make} 
a great deal of more room next year.

\tsh How, in the name of wonder!\break
\stick{could your uncle \toby, who, it seems,}
\stick{was a military man, and whom you have} 
\stick{represented as no fool,\tsk be at the same} 
\stick{time such a confused, pudding-headed,}
muddle-headed, fellow, as\tsk Go look.

So, Sir Critick, I could have replied;\break
\stick{but I scorn it.\tsh ’Tis language un-}
\stick{urbane,\tsk and only befitting the man}
\natch{who}
\stick{who cannot give clear and satisfactory}
\stick{accounts of things, or dive deep enough}
\stick{into the first causes of human ignorance}
\stick{and confusion. It is moreover the re-}
\stick{ply valiant,\tsk and therefore I reject it;}
\stick{for tho’ it might have suited my uncle} 
\stick{\toby's character as a soldier excellently}
\stick{well,\tsk and had he not accustomed him-}
\stick{self, in such attacks, to whistle the \i{Lilla}-}
\stick{\i{bullero},\tsk as he wanted no courage, ’tis} 
\stick{the very answer he would have given;}
\stick{yet it would by no means have done for}
\stick{me. You see as plain as can be, that I}
\stick{write as a man of erudition;\tsk that even}
\stick{my similies, my allusions, my illustra-}
\stick{tions, my metaphors, are erudite,\tsk and}
\stick{that I must sustain my character properly,}
\stick{and contrast it properly too,\tsk else what}
\stick{would become of me?  Why, Sir, I}
\stick{should be undone;\tsk at this very mo-}
\stick{ment that I am going here to fill up one}
\natch{place}
\stick{place against a critick,\tsk I should have}
made an opening for a couple.

\tsh Therefore I answer thus:

Pray, Sir, in all the reading which you\break
\stick{have ever read, did you ever read such a} 
\stick{book as \i{Locke}’s Essay upon the Human}
\stick{Understanding?\tsh Don’t answer me} 
\stick{rashly,\tsk because many, I know, quote the}
\stick{book, who have not read it,\tsk and many}
\stick{have read it who understand it not:\tsk If} 
\stick{either of these is your case, as I write to} 
\stick{instruct, I will tell you in three words}
\stick{what the book is.\tsk It is a history.\tsk A}
\stck{history! of who? what? where? when?}
\stick{Don’t hurry yourself.\tsk It is a history-}
\stick{book, Sir, (which may possibly recom-}
\stick{mend it to the world) of what passes in a}
\stick{man’s own mind; and if you will say so}
\stick{much of the book, and no more, believe}
\natch{me,}
\stick{me, you will cut no contemptible figure}
in a metaphysic circle.

But this by the way.

Now if you will venture to go along\break
\stick{with me, and look down into the bottom} 
\stick{of this matter, it will be found that the}
\stick{cause of obscurity and confusion, in the}
mind of a man, is threefold.

Dull organs, dear Sir, in the first place.\break
\stck{Secondly, slight and transient impressions}
\stick{made by objects when the said organs are}
\stick{not dull. And, thirdly, a memory like}
\stick{unto a sieve, not able to retain what it has}
\stick{received.\tsk Call down \i{Dolly} your cham-}
\stick{ber-maid, and I will give you my cap}
\stick{and bell along with it, if I make not this}
\stick{matter so plain that \i{Dolly} herself shall}
\stick{understand it as well as \i{Malbranch.}\tsh}
\natch{When}
\stick{When \i{Dolly} has indited her epistle to}
\stick{\i{Robin}, and has thrust her arm into the}
\stick{bottom of her pocket hanging by her}
\stick{right-side;\tsk take that opportunity to}
\stick{recollect that the organs and faculties of}
\stick{perception, can, by nothing in this world,}
\stick{be so aptly typified and explained as by}
\stick{that one thing which \i{Dolly}’s hand is in}
\stick{search of.\tsk Your organs are not so dull}
\stick{that I should inform you,\tsk ’tis an inch,}
Sir, of red seal-wax.

\tight{When this is melted and dropped upon}\break
\stick{the letter, if \i{Dolly} fumbles too long for}
\stick{her thimble, till the wax is over harden’d,}
\stick{it will not receive the mark of her thim-}
\stick{ble from the usual impulse which was}
\stick{wont to imprint it. Very well: If \i{Dolly}’s} 
\stick{wax, for want of better, is bees-wax, or} 
\stick{of a temper too soft,\tsk tho’ it may re-}
\stick{ceive,\tsk it will not hold the impression,}
\natch{how}
\stick{how hard soever \i{Dolly} thrusts against it;} 
\stick{and last of all, supposing the wax good,}
\stick{and eke the thimble, but applied there-}
\stick{to in careless haste, as her Mistress rings}
\stick{the bell;\tsh in any one of these three}
\stick{cases, the print, left by the thimble, will}
\stick{be as unlike the prototype as a brass-}
jack.

Now you must understand that not\break
\stick{one of these was the true cause of the}
\stick{confusion in my uncle \toby's discourse;}
\stick{and it is for that very reason I enlarge}
\stick{upon them so long, after the manner of}
\stick{great physiologists\tsk to shew the world,}
what it did \i{not} arise from.

What it did arise from, I have hinted\break
\stick{above, and a fertile source of obscurity}
\stick{it is,\tsk and ever will be,\tsk and that is the} 
\stick{unsteady uses of words which have per-} 
\natch{plexed} 
\stick{plexed the clearest and most exalted un-}
derstandings.

It is ten to one (at \i{Arthur}’s) whether\break
\stick{you have ever read the literary histories} 
\stick{of past ages;\tsk if you have,\tsk what ter-}
\stick{rible battles, ’yclept logomachies, have} 
\stick{they occasioned and perpetuated with so}
\stick{much gall and ink-shed,\tsk that a good}
\stick{natured man cannot read the accounts}
of them without tears in his eyes.

\tight{Gentle critick! when thou hast weigh’d}\break
\stck{all this, and consider’d within thyself how}
\stick{much of thy own knowledge, discourse,} 
\stick{and conversation has been pestered and}
\stick{disordered, at one time or other, by this,}
\stick{and this only:\tsh What a pudder and}
\stick{racket in \s{Councils} about \g{οὐσία} and \g{ὑπό}-}
\stck{\g{στασις}; and in the \s{Schools} of the learned}
\stick{about power and about spirit;\tsk about}
\natch{essences,}
\stick{essences, and about quintessences;\tsh}
\stick{about substances, and about space.\tsh}
\stick{What confusion in greater \s{Theatres}}
\stick{from words of little meaning, and as in-}
\stick{determinate a sense;\tsk when thou consi-}
\stick{ders this, thou wilt not wonder at my}
\stick{uncle \toby's perplexities,\tsk thou wilt drop}
\stick{a tear of pity upon his scarp and his coun-}
\stick{terscarp;\tsk his glacis and his covered-}
\stick{way;\tsk his ravelin and his half-moon:}
\stick{’Twas not by ideas,\tsh by heaven!}
his life was put in jeopardy by words.

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  III.}

\dropcap{W}{hen} my uncle \toby got his map\break
of \i{Namur} to his mind, he began\break
\stick{immediately to apply himself, and with} 
\stick{the utmost diligence, to the study of it;} 
\stick{for nothing being of more importance}
\natch{to}
\stick{to him than his recovery, and his reco-}
\stick{very depending, as you have read, up-}
\stick{on the passions and affections of his} 
\stick{mind, it behoved him to take the nicest} 
\stick{care to make himself so far master of his} 
\stick{subject, as to be able to talk upon it} 
without emotion.

In a fortnight’s close and painful ap-
\stick{plication, which, by the bye, did my} 
\stick{uncle \toby's wound, upon his groin, no}
\stick{good,\tsk he was enabled, by the help of}
\stick{some marginal documents at the feet of} 
\stck{the elephant, together with \i{Gobesius}’s mi-}
\stick{litary architecture and pyroballogy, tran-}
\stick{slated from the \i{Flemish}, to form his dis-}
\stick{course with passable perspicuity; and}
\stick{before he was two full months gone,\tsk}
\stick{he was right eloquent upon it, and could} 
\stick{make not only the attack of the advan-}
\natch{ced}
\stick{ced counterscarp with great order;\tsh}
\stick{but having, by that time, gone much}
\stick{deeper into the art, than what his first}
\stick{motive made necessary,\tsk my uncle \i{Toby}}
\stick{was able to cross the \i{Maes} and \i{Sambre};}
\stick{make diversions as far as \i{Vauban}’s line,} 
\stick{the abbey of \i{Salsines}, \etc and give his} 
\stick{visiters as distinct a history of each of} 
\stick{their attacks, as of that of the gate of}
\stick{\i{St.\@ Nicolas}, where he had the honour to}
receive his wound.

But the desire of knowledge, like the
\stck{thirst of riches, increases ever with the ac-}
\stick{quisition of it. The more my uncle \i{Toby}}
\stick{pored over his map, the more he took a}
\stick{liking to it;\tsk by the same process and}
\stick{electrical assimilation, as I told you, thro’}
\stick{which I ween the souls of connoisseurs}
\stick{themselves, by long friction and incum-}
\stick{bition, have the happiness, at length, to}
\natch{get}
\stick{get all be-virtu’d,\tsk be-pictur’d,\tsk be-}
butterflied, and be-fiddled.

The more my uncle \toby drank of this\break
\stck{sweet fountain of science, the greater was}
\stick{the heat and impatience of his thirst,}
\stick{so that, before the first year of his con-}
\stick{finement had well gone round, there was}
\stick{scarce a fortified town in \i{Italy} or \i{Flanders},}
\stick{of which, by one means or other, he had}
\stick{not procured a plan, reading over as he}
\stick{got them, and carefully collating there-}
\stick{with the histories of their sieges, their de-}
\stick{molitions, their improvements, and new}
\stick{works, all which he would read with that} 
\stick{intense application and delight, that he}
\stick{would forget himself, his wound, his con-}
finement, his dinner.

In the second year my uncle \toby pur-\break
\stick{chased \i{Ramelli} and \i{Cataneo}, translated}
\natch{from}
\stick{from the \i{Italian};\tsk likewise \i{Stevinus},}
\stick{\i{Moralis}, the Chevalier \i{de Ville}, \i{Lorini},} 
\stick{\i{Cochorn}, \i{Sheeter}, the Count \i{de Pagan},} 
\stick{the Marshal \i{Vauban}, Mons.\@ \i{Blondel}, with}
\stick{almost as many more books of military}
\stick{architecture, as Don \i{Quixote} was found} 
\stick{to have of chivalry, when the curate and}
barber invaded his library.

Towards the beginning of the third\break
\stick{year, which was in \i{August}, ninety-nine,}
\stick{my uncle \toby found it necessary to un-}
\stick{derstand a little of projectiles:\tsk And ha-}
\stick{ving judged it best to draw his know-}
\stick{ledge from the fountain-head, he began}
\stick{with \i{N.\@ Tartaglia}, who it seems was the} 
\stick{first man who detected the imposition of} 
\stick{a canon-ball’s doing all that mischief}
\stick{under the notion of a right line.\tsk This}
\stick{\i{N.\@ Tartaglia} proved to my uncle \toby to}
be an impossible thing.\patch{\tsk Endless}

\tsh Endless is the Search of\break 
Truth!

No sooner was my uncle \toby satisfied\break
\stick{which road the cannon-ball did not go,}
\stck{but he was insensibly led on, and resolved}
\stick{in his mind to enquire and find out}
\stick{which road the ball did go: For which} 
\stick{purpose he was obliged to set off afresh} 
\stick{with old \i{Maltus}, and studied him devout-}
\stick{ly.\tsk He proceeded next to \i{Galileo} and}
\stick{\i{Torricellius}, wherein, by certain geome-}
\stick{trical rules, infallibly laid down, he found} 
\stick{the precise path to be a \s{Parabola},\tsk or}
\stick{else an \s{Hyperbola},\tsk and that the pa-}
\stick{rameter, or \i{latus rectum}, of the conic sec-}
\stick{tion of the said path, was to the quantity}
\stick{and amplitude in a direct \i{ratio}, as the} 
\stick{whole line to the sine of double the angle} 
\stick{of incidence, form’d by the breech upon} 
\stick{an horizontal plane;\tsk and that the semi-}
\natch{parameter,}
\stick{parameter,\tsh stop! my dear uncle}
\stick{\i{Toby}\tsh stop!\tsh go not one foot further} 
\stick{into this thorny and bewilder’d track,\tsk}
\stick{intricate are the steps!  intricate are the}
\stick{mases of this labyrinth! intricate are the}
\stck{troubles which the pursuit of this bewitch-}
\stick{ing phantom, \s{Knowledge}, will bring}
\stick{upon thee.\tsk O my uncle! fly\tsk fly\tsk}
\stick{fly from it as from a serpent.\tsk Is it fit,}
\stick{good-natur’d man!\@ thou should’st sit up,}
\stick{with the wound upon thy groin, whole}

\initial[nindent=0pt]{I}{Would}
not give a groat for that man’s\break

\stick{fore I forthwith put an end to the chap-}

\tsh Writers of my stamp have\break

\stick{Where an exact copying makes our} 
\stick{pictures less striking, we choose the less}

\stick{This is to be understood \i{cum grano salis};}
\natch{but}

\stick{made more for the sake of letting the}
\stick{apostrophe cool, than any thing else,\tsk}
\stick{’tis not very material whether upon any}
\stick{other score the reader approves of it or}
not.

In the latter end of the third year, my\break
\stick{uncle \toby perceiving that the parameter}
\stick{and semi-parameter of the conic section,}
\stick{angered his wound, he left off the study} 
\stick{of projectiles in a kind of a huff, and}
\stick{betook himself to the practical part of}
\stick{fortification only; the pleasure of which,}
\stick{like a spring held back, returned upon}
him with redoubled force.

It was in this year that my uncle be-\break

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  V.}

\dropcap{W}{hen} a man gives himself up to\break 
the government of a ruling pas-\break
\stick{sion,\tsfill or, in other words, when his}
\stick{\s{Hobby-Horse} grows head-strong,\tsk}
farewell cool reason and fair discretion!

My uncle \toby's wound was near well,\break
\stick{and as soon as the surgeon recovered his} 
\stick{surprize, and could get leave to say as}
\stick{much\tsk he told him, ’twas just beginning}
\stick{to incarnate; and that if no fresh exfolia-}
\stick{tion happen’d, which there was no signs}
\stick{of,\tsk it would be dried up in five or six}
\natch{weeks.}
\stick{weeks. The sound of as many olym-}
\stick{piads twelve hours before, would have}
\stick{convey’d an idea of shorter duration to}
\stick{my uncle \toby's mind.\tsh The succession}
\stick{of his ideas was now rapid,\tsk he broil’d} 
\stick{with impatience to put his design in} 
\stick{execution;\tsk and so, without consulting}
\stick{further with any soul living,\tsk which,} 
\stick{by the bye, I think is right, when you} 
\stick{are predetermined to take no one soul’s}
\stick{advice,\tsk he privately ordered \trim, his}
\stick{man, to pack up a bundle of lint and}
\stick{dressings, and hire a chariot and four to}
\stick{be at the door exactly by twelve o’clock}
\stick{that day, when he knew my father would} 
\stick{be upon ’Change.\tsk So leaving a bank-}
\stick{note upon the table for the surgeon’s} 
\stick{care of him, and a letter of tender thanks} 
\stick{for his brother’s,\tsk he pack’d up his}
\stick{maps, his books of fortification, his in-}
\stick{struments, \etc\tsk and, by the help of a}
\natch{crutch,}
\stick{crutch on one side, and \trim on the}
\stick{other,\tsh my uncle \toby embark’d for}
\i{Shandy-Hall}.

The reason, or rather the rise, of this\break
sudden demigration, was as follows:

The table in my uncle \toby's room,\break
\stick{and at which, the night before this} 
\stick{change happened, he was sitting with his}
\stick{maps, \etc about him,\tsk being somewhat}
\stick{of the smallest, for that infinity of great}
\stick{and small instruments of knowledge}
\stick{which usually lay crouded upon it;\tsk he}
\stick{had the accident, in reaching over for}
\stick{his tobacco-box, to throw down his com-}
\stick{passes, and in stooping to take the com-}
\stick{passes up, with his sleeve he threw down}
\stick{his case of instruments and snuffers;\tsk}
\stick{and as the dice took a run against him,}
\stick{in his endeavouring to catch the snuffers}
\natch{in}
\stick{in falling,\tsh he thrust Monsieur \i{Blondel}} 
\stick{off the table and Count \i{de Pagan} o’\,top}
of him.

’Twas to no purpose for a man, lame\break
\stick{as my uncle \toby was, to think of redres-}
\stick{sing all these evils by himself,\tsk he rung}
\stick{his bell for his man \trim;\tsk \i{Trim!} quoth} 
\stick{my uncle \toby, pri’thee see what confu-}
\stick{sion I have here been making.\tsk I must}
\stick{have some better contrivance, \trim.\tsk}
\stick{Can’st not thou take my rule and mea-}
\stick{sure the length and breadth of this table,}
\stick{and then go and bespeak me one as big} 
\stick{again?\tsk Yes, an’ please your Honour,} 
\stick{replied \trim, making a bow;\tsk but I}
\stick{hope your Honour will be soon well}
\stick{enough to get down to your country seat,}
\stick{where,\tsk as your Honour takes so much}
\stick{pleasure in fortification, we could ma-}
nage this matter to a T.\patch{I}

I must here inform you, that this ser-\break
\stick{vant of my uncle \toby's, who went by} 
\stick{the name of \trim, had been a Corporal}
\stick{in my uncle’s own company,\tsh his real}
\stick{name was \i{James Butler},\tsk but having} 
\stick{got the nick-name of \trim in the regi-}
\stck{ment, my uncle \toby, unless when he hap-}
\stick{pened to be very angry with him, would} 
never call him by any other name.

The poor fellow had been disabled\break
\stick{for the service, by a wound on his left} 
\stick{knee by a musket-bullet, at the battle of}
\stick{\i{Landen}, which was two years before the}
\stick{affair of \i{Namur};\tsk and as the fellow was}
\stick{well beloved in the regiment, and a}
\stick{handy fellow into the bargain, my uncle}
\stick{\toby took him for his servant, and of ex-}
\stick{cellent use was he, attending my uncle}
\stick{\toby in the camp and in his quarters as}
\stick{valet, groom, barber, cook, sempster,}
\natch{and}
\stick{and nurse; and indeed, from first to last,} 
\stick{waited upon him and served him with}
great fidelity and affection.

My uncle \toby loved the man in re-\break
\stick{turn, and what attached him more to}
\stick{him still, was the similitude of their}
\stick{knowledge:\tsk For Corporal \trim, (for} 
\stick{so, for the future, I shall call him) by}
\stick{four years occasional attention to his}
\stick{Master’s discourse upon fortified towns,}
\stick{and the advantage of prying and peeping}
\stick{continually into his Master’s plans, \etc}
\stick{exclusive and besides what he gained}
\stick{\s{Hobby-Horsically}, as a body-servant,}
\stick{\i{Non Hobby-Horsical per se};\tsk had be-}
\stick{come no mean proficient in the science;}
\stick{and was thought, by the cook and cham-}
\stick{ber-maid, to know as much of the na-}
\stick{ture of strong-holds as my uncle \toby}
himself.\patch{I}

I have but one more stroke to give to
\stick{finish Corporal \trim's character,\tsk and it}
\stick{is the only dark line in it.\tsk The fellow} 
\stick{lov’d to advise,\tsk or rather to hear him-}
\stick{self talk; his carriage, however, was so}
\stick{perfectly respectful, ’twas easy to keep}
\stick{him silent when you had him so; but set}
\stick{his tongue a-going,\tsk you had no hold} 
\stick{of him;\tsk he was voluble;\tsk the eternal} 
\stick{interlardings of \i{your Honour}, with the}
\stck{respectfulness of Corporal \trim's manner,}
\stick{interceding so strong in behalf of his}
\stick{elocution,\tsk that tho’ you might have} 
\stick{been incommoded,\tsk you could not well}
\stick{be angry. My uncle \toby was seldom} 
\stick{either the one or the other with him,\tsk}
\stick{or, at least, this fault, in \trim, broke no}
\stick{squares with ’em. My uncle \toby, as} 
\stick{I said, loved the man;\tsk and besides, as} 
\stick{he ever looked upon a faithful servant,\tsk}
\stick{but as a humble friend,\tsk he could not}
\natch{bear}
\stick{bear to stop his mouth.\tsh Such was Cor-}
poral \trim.

If I durst presume, continued \trim,\break 
\stick{to give your Honour my advice, and}
\stick{speak my opinion in this matter.\tsk Thou}
\stick{art welcome, \trim, quoth my uncle}
\stck{\toby,\tsk speak,\tsh speak what thou thinkest}
\stick{upon the subject, man, without fear.}
\stick{Why then, replied \trim, (not hanging}
\stick{his ears and scratching his head like a}
\stick{country lout, but) stroking his hair back} 
\stick{from his forehead, and standing erect as} 
\stick{before his division.\tsh I think, quoth}
\stick{\trim, advancing his left, which was his}
\stick{lame leg, a little forwards,\tsk and point-}
\stick{ing with his right hand open towards a}
\stck{map of \i{Dunkirk}, which was pinn’d against}
\stick{the hangings,\tsk I think, quoth Corporal}
\stick{\trim, with humble submission to your}
\stick{Honour’s better judgment,\tsh that these}
\natch{ravelins,}
\stick{ravelins, bastions, curtins, and horn-}
\stick{works, make but a poor, contemptible,}
\stick{fiddle faddle piece of work of it here}
\stick{upon paper, compared to what your Ho-}
\stick{nour and I could make of it, were we in} 
\stick{the country by ourselves, and had but a}
\stick{rood, or a rood and a half of ground to}
\stick{do what we pleased with: As summer is}
\stick{coming on, continued \trim, your Ho-}
\stick{nour might sit out of doors, and give me}
\stick{the nography\tsh (call it ichnography,}
\stick{quoth my uncle)\tsk of the town or cita-}
\stick{del, your Honour was pleased to sit down}
\stick{before,\tsk and I will be shot by your Ho-}
\stick{nour upon the glacis of it, if I did not}
\stick{fortify it to your Honour’s mind.\tsk I dare}
\stick{say thou would’st, \trim, quoth my uncle.}
\stick{\tsk For if your Honour, continued the} 
\stick{Corporal, could but mark me the poly-}
\stick{gon, with its exact lines and angles.\tsh}
\stick{That I could do very well, quoth my}
\natch{uncle.}
\stick{uncle.\tsk I would begin with the fossé,}
\stick{and if your Honour could tell me the} 
\stick{proper depth and breadth,\tsk I can to a}
\stick{hair’s breadth, \trim, replied my uncle,\tsk}
\stick{I would throw out the earth upon this} 
\stick{hand towards the town for the scarp,\tsk}
\stick{and on that hand towards the campaign}
\stick{for the counterscarp.\tsk Very right, \trim;} 
\stick{quoth my uncle \toby.\tsk And when I had} 
\stick{sloped them to your mind,\tsk an’ please} 
\stick{your Honour, I would face the glacis, as}
\stick{the finest fortifications are done in \i{Flan-}}
\stick{\i{ders}, with sods,\tsk and as your Honour}
\stick{knows they should be,\tsk and I would}
\stick{make the walls and parapets with sods}
\stick{too;\tsk The best engineers call them ga-}
\stick{zons, \trim, said my uncle \toby;\tsk Whe-}
\stick{ther they are gazons or sods, is not much}
\stick{matter, replied \trim, your Honour knows}
\stick{they are ten times beyond a facing either}
\stick{of brick or stone;\tsh I know they are,}
\natch{\trim}
\stck{\trim, in some respects,\tsh quoth my uncle}
\stick{\toby, nodding his head;\tsk for a cannon-}
\stick{ball enters into the gazon right onwards,} 
\stick{without bringing any rubbish down with}
\stick{it, which might fill the fossé, (as was the}
\stick{case at \i{St.\@ Nicolas}’s \i{Gate)}\sic and facilitate}
the passage over it.

Your Honour understands these mat-\break
\stick{ters, replied Corporal \trim, better than}
\stick{any officer in his Majesty’s service;\tsk}
\stick{but would your Honour please to let the}
\stick{bespeaking of the table alone, and let us} 
\stick{but go into the country, I would work}
\stick{under your Honour’s directions like a} 
\stick{horse, and make fortifications for you}
\stick{something like a tansy, with all their}
\stick{batteries, saps, ditches, and palisadoes,} 
\stick{that it should be worth all the world’s}
riding twenty miles to go and see it.
\patch{My}

My uncle \toby blushed as red as scar-
\stick{let as \trim went on;\tsk but it was not a}
\stick{blush of guilt,\tsk of modesty,\tsk or of an-}
\stick{ger;\tsk it was a blush of joy;\tsk he was} 
\stick{fired with Corporal \trim's project and}
\stick{description.\tsk \i{Trim!} said my uncle \toby,} 
\stick{thou hast said enough.\tsk We might be-}
\stick{gin the campaign, continued \trim, on}
\stick{the very day that his Majesty and the}
\stick{Allies take the field, and demolish them} 
\stick{town by town as fast as\tsh \trim, quoth}
\stick{my uncle \toby, say no more.\tsk Your Ho-}
\stick{nour, continued \trim, might sit in your} 
\stick{arm-chair (\,pointing to it\,) this fine}
\stick{weather, giving me your orders, and I}
\stick{would\tsh Say no more, \trim, quoth my} 
\stick{uncle \toby.\tsh Besides, your Honour}
\stick{would get not only pleasure and good}
\stick{pastime,\tsk but good air, and good exer-}
\stick{cise, and good health,\tsk and your Ho-}
\stick{nour’s wound would be well in a month.}
\natch{Thou}
\stick{Thou hast said enough, \trim,\tsk quoth}
\stick{my uncle \toby (putting his hand into}
\stick{his breeches-pocket)\tsh I like thy project}
\stick{mightily;\tsk And if your Honour pleases,} 
\stick{I’ll, this moment, go and buy a pioneer’s}
\stick{spade to take down with us, and I’ll be-}
\stck{speak a shovel and a pick-ax, and a couple}
\stick{of\tsh Say no more, \trim, quoth my}
\stick{uncle \toby, leaping up upon one leg,}
\stick{quite overcome with rapture,\tsk and}
\stick{thrusting a guinea into \trim's hand,\tsk}
\stick{\trim, said my uncle \toby, say no more;\tsk}
\stick{but go down, \trim, this moment, my}
\stick{lad, and bring up my supper this in-} 
stant.

\trim ran down and brought up his
\stick{Master’s supper,\tsk to no purpose:\tsh}
\stick{\trim's plan of operation ran so in my}
\stick{uncle \toby's head, he could not taste}
\stick{it.\tsk \trim, quoth my uncle \toby, get me}
\natch{to}
to-bed;\tsk ’twas all one.\tsk Corporal \trim's
description had fired his imagination,\tsk\break
my uncle \toby could not shut his eyes.\tsk\break
The more he consider’d it, the more 
bewitching the scene appeared to him;\tsk\break
so that, two full hours before day-light, he had
come to a final determination,\break
and had concerted the whole plan of his\break
and Corporal \trim's decampment.

My uncle \toby had a little neat coun-\break
try-house of his own, in the village where my father’s estate lay at \i{Shandy},
which had been left him by an old uncle,\break with a small estate of
about one hundred pounds a year. Behind this house, and contiguous
to it, was a kitchen-garden of about half an acre;\tsk and at the
bottom of the garden, and cut off from it\break
by a tall yew hedge, was a bowling-\break 
green, containing just about as much
\natch{ground}
ground as Corporal
\trim wished for;\tsk\break
so that as \trim uttered the
words, \lqq A rood and a half of ground to do what\break
they would with:”\tsh this identical bowling-green instantly presented
itself, \stck{and became curiously painted, all at once,} upon the retina
of my uncle \toby's fancy;\break\tsh which was the physical
cause of making him change colour, or at least, of heightening his
blush to that immo-\break
derate degree I spoke of.

Never did lover post down to a belov’d mistress with more heat
and expectation, than my uncle \toby did, to enjoy this\break
self-same thing in private;\tsk I say in pri-\break
\stick{vate;\tsh for it was sheltered from the} house, as
I told you, by a tall yew hedge, and was covered on the other three
sides, from mortal sight, by rough holly and thickset flowering
shrubs;\tsk so that the
\natch{idea}
idea of not being seen, did not a little contribute to the
idea of pleasure pre-conceived in my uncle \toby's
mind.\tsk\break 
\stick{Vain thought! however thick it was}
planted about,\tsh or private soever it\break 
might seem,\tsk to think, dear uncle \toby, 
of enjoying a thing which took up a\break
whole rood and a half of ground,\tsk and\break
not have it known!

\tight{How my uncle \toby and Corporal \trim} managed this
matter,\tsk with the history of their campaigns, which were no
way barren of events,\tsh may make no unin-\break teresting
under-plot in the epitasis and working up of this drama.\tsk At
present the scene must drop,\tsk and change for the parlour
fire-side.\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

\quad\tsh What can they be doing,\break
brother? said my father.\tsk I think, re-\break
plied my uncle \toby,\tsk taking, as I told you,
his pipe from his mouth, and striking the ashes out of it as he
began his sentence;\tsh I think, replied he,\tsk it
would not be amiss, brother, if we rung the\break bell.

Pray, what’s all that racket over our heads,
\i{Obadiah?}\tsk quoth my father;\tsk\break
my brother and I can scarce hear ourselves speak.

Sir, answer’d \i{Obadiah}, making a bow
towards his left-shoulder,\tsk my Mistress
is taken very badly;\tsk and where’s \i{Susannah}
running down the garden there,
\natch{as}
as if they were going to ravish her?\tsh\break
Sir, she is running the shortest cut into the town, replied
\i{Obadiah}, to fetch the old midwife.\tsh Then saddle a
horse, quoth my father, and do you go direct\-ly for Dr.\@
\i{Slop}, the man-midwife, with all our services,\tsk and
let him know your Mistress is fallen into labour,\tsk and that I
desire he will return with you with all speed.

It is very strange, says my father, addressing himself to my
uncle \toby, as \i{Obadiah} shut the door,\tsh as
there is so expert an operator as \drslop so
near\tsk\break that my wife should persist to the very last in
this obstinate humour of hers, in trusting the life of my child,
who has had one misfortune already, to the ignorance of an old
woman;\tsh and not only the life of my child, brother,\tsh but
her own
\natch{life}
life, and with it the lives of all the children I might,
peradventure, have begot out of her hereafter.

Mayhap, brother, replied my uncle\break
\toby, my sister does it to save the expence:\tsk A
pudding’s end,\tsk replied my father,\tsh the doctor must be
paid the same for inaction as action,\tsk if not better,\tsk
to keep him in temper.

\noindent
\stick{\indent\tsh Then it can be out of no-}
\stick{thing in the whole world, quoth my}
\stick{uncle \toby, in the simplicity of his heart,}
\stick{\tsk but \s{Modesty}:\tsk My sister, I dare}
\stick{say, added he, does not care to let a}
\stick{man come so near her \wastiv. I will}
\stick{not say whether my uncle \toby had com-}
\stick{pleted the sentence or not;\tsh ’tis for} 
\stick{his advantage to suppose he had,\tsh}
\stick{as, I think, he could have added no}
\natch{\s{One}
}
\stick{\lss{\textsc{One Word}} which would have im-}
proved it.

If, on the contrary, my uncle \toby had 
\stick{not fully arrived at the period’s end,\tsk}
\stick{then the world stands indebted to the} 
\stick{sudden snapping of my father’s tobacco-}
\stick{pipe, for one of the neatest examples of}
\stick{that ornamental figure in oratory, which}
\stick{Rhetoricians stile the \i{Aposiopesis.}\tsk Just}
\stick{heaven! how does the \i{Poco piu} and the} 
\stick{\i{Poco meno} of the \i{Italian} artists;\tsk the in-}
\stick{sensible \s{more} or \textscl{less}, determine the} 
\stick{precise line of beauty in the sentence, as}
\stick{well as in the statue! How do the slight} 
\stick{touches of the chisel, the pencil, the pen,} 
\stick{the fiddle-stick, \i{et cætera},\tsk give the true} 
\stick{swell, which gives the true pleasure!\tsk O} 
\stick{my countrymen!\tsk be nice;\tsk be cau-}
\stick{tious of your language;\tsh and never,}
\stick{O! never let it be forgotten upon what}
\natch{small}
\stick{small particles your eloquence and your} 
fame depend.

\tsh \lqq My sister, mayhap,” quoth my
\stick{uncle \toby, \lqq does not choose to let a}
\stick{\lqq man come so near her \wastiv” Make}
\stick{this dash,\tsk ’tis an Aposiopesis:\tsk Take}
\stick{the dash away, and write \i{Backside},\tsh}
\stick{’tis Bawdy.\tsk Scratch Backside out, and}
\stick{put \i{Cover’d-way} in,\tsk ’tis a Metaphor;\tsk}
\stick{and, I dare say, as fortification ran so} 
\stick{much in my uncle \toby's head, that if he}
\stick{had been left to have added one word to}
the sentence,\tsh that word was it.

But whether that was the case or not
\stick{the case;\tsk or whether the snapping of} 
\stick{my father’s tobacco-pipe, so critically,}
\stick{happened thro’ accident or anger,\tsk will}
be seen in due time.\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  VII.}

\dropcap{T}{ho}’ my father was a good natural
philosopher,\tsk yet he was something of a moral philosopher
too; for which reason, when his tobacco-pipe\break snapp’d short
in the middle,\tsk he had nothing to do,\tsk as such,\tsk
but to have taken hold of the two pieces, and thrown them
gently upon the back of the fire.\tsh\break He did no such
thing;\tsh he threw them with all the violence in the
world;\tsk and, to give the action still more
emphasis,\tsk\break he started upon both his legs to\break
do it.

This look’d something like heat;\tsh\break
and the manner of his reply to what\break
my uncle \toby was saying, prov’d it\break
was so.\patch{\lqq Not}

\tsh \lqq Not choose,” quoth my father,
\stick{repeating my uncle \toby's words, \lqq to let}
\stick{\lqq a man come so near her.”\tsh By hea-}
\stick{ven, brother \i{Toby!} you would try the}
\stick{patience of a \i{Job};\tsk and I think I have}
\stick{the plagues of one already, without it.}
\stick{\tsh Why?\tsk Where?\tsk Wherein?\tsh}
\stick{Wherefore?\tsh Upon what account? re-} 
\stick{plied my uncle \toby: in the utmost asto-}
\stick{nishment.\tsh To think, said my father,}
\stick{of a man living to your age, brother,} 
\stick{and knowing so little about women!\tsh}
\stick{I know nothing at all about them,\tsk re-}
\stick{plied my uncle \toby; and I think, con-}
\stick{tinued he, that the shock I received the}
\stick{year after the demolition of \i{Dunkirk}, in}
\stick{my affair with widow \i{Wadman};\tsk which}
\stick{shock you know I should not have re-}
\stick{ceived, but from my total ignorance of} 
\stick{the sex,\tsk has given me just cause to say,}
\stick{That I neither know, nor do pretend to}
\natch{know,}
\stick{know, any thing about ’em, or their}
\stick{concerns either.\tsh Methinks, brother,}
\stick{replied my father, you might, at least,}
\stick{know so much as the right end of a}
woman from the wrong.

It is said in \i{Aristotle}’s \i{Master-Piece},\break
\stick{\lqq That when a man doth think of any}

\stick{\lqq upon the ground;\tsh but that when he}
\stick{\lqq thinketh of something that is to come,}

My uncle \toby, I suppose, thought of neither, for he
look’d horizontally.\tsk\break
Right end,\tsk quoth my uncle \toby, muttering the two words low to himself, and fixing his
two eyes insensibly as he muttered them, upon a small crevice,

quoth my uncle, I know no more which it is, than the man in the
moon;\tsk and if I was to think, continued my uncle
\toby (keeping his eyes still fix’d upon the bad joint)
this month together, I am sure I should not be able to find it
out.

Then brother \toby, replied my father, I will tell you.

Every thing in this world, continued my father (filling a fresh
pipe)\tsk every thing in this earthly world, my dear

has two hands,\tsk\break

\s{Analogy}, replied my father, is the certain

tobacco-pipe) in two,\tsk and, at the same time, crushed the head
of as notable and curious a dissertation as ever was
engendered in the womb of speculation;\tsk it was some months
before my father could get an opportunity to be safely
deliver’d of
it:\tsk And, at this hour, it is a thing\break
\stick{full as problematical as the subject of the}
\stick{dissertation itself,\tsk (considering the con-}
\stck{fusion and distresses of our domestic mis-}

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  VIII.}

\dropcap{I}{t} is about an hour and a
half’s tole\-rable good reading since my uncle \toby rung
the bell, when \i{Obadiah} was\break
order’d to saddle a horse, and go for\break 
\drslop the man-midwife;\tsk so that no one can say,
with reason, that I have not allowed \i{Obadiah} time enough,
poetically \stck{speaking, and considering the emergency} too, both to go
and come;\tsh tho’,\break
morally and truly speaking, the man\break
perhaps, has scarce had time to get on\break
his boots.

If the hypercritic will go upon this; and is resolved after all
to take a pen-
\natch{dulum,}
\stick{dulum, and measure the true distance}
\stick{betwixt the ringing of the bell, and the} 
\stick{rap at the door;\tsk and, after finding it}
\stick{to be no more than two minutes, thirteen} 
\stick{seconds, and three fifths,\tsk should take} 
\stick{upon him to insult over me for such a} 
\stick{breach in the unity, or rather probability,}
\stick{of time;\tsk I would remind him, that the} 
\stick{idea of duration, and of its simple modes,} 
\stick{is got merely from the train and succes-}
\stick{sion of our ideas,\tsk and is the true scho-}
\stick{lastic pendulum,\tsh and by which, as a} 
\stick{scholar, I will be tried in this matter,\tsk}
\stick{abjuring and detesting the jurisdiction of}
all other pendulums whatever.

I would, therefore, desire him to consider that it is but poor
eight miles from \i{Shandy-Hall} to \drslop, the
man-mid\-wife’s house;\tsk and that whilst \i{Obadiah} has
been going those said miles and back,
\natch{I}
I have brought my uncle \toby from \i{Namur}, 
quite across all \i{Flanders}, into \i{England}:\tsk
That I have had him ill upon my\break
\stick{hands near four years;\tsk and have since}
\stick{travelled him and Corporal \trim, in a} 
\stick{chariot and four, a journey of near two} 
\stick{hundred miles down into \i{Yorkshire};\tsk all}
\stick{which put together, must have prepared} 
\stick{the reader’s imagination for the entrance}
\stick{of \drslop upon the stage,\tsk as much, at} 
\stick{least (I hope) as a dance, a song, or a} 
concerto between the acts.

If my hypercritic is intractable,\tsk al-\break
\stick{ledging, that two minutes and thirteen}
\stick{seconds are no more than two minutes} 
\stick{and thirteen seconds,\tsk when I have said}
\stick{all I can about them;\tsk and that this}
\stick{plea, tho’ it might save me dramatically,} 
\stick{will damn me biographically, rendering}
\stick{my book, from this very moment, a pro-}
\natch{fess’d}
\stick{fess’d \s{Romance}, which, before, was a}
\stick{book apocryphal:\tsk If I am thus pres-}
\stick{sed.\tsk I then put an end to the whole}
\stick{objection and controversy about it all at}
\stick{once,\tsk by acquainting him, that \i{Obadiah}}
\stick{had not got above threescore yards from} 
\stick{the stable-yard before he met with Dr.}
\stick{\i{Slop};\tsk and indeed he gave a dirty proof}
\stick{that he had met with him,\tsk and was}
\stick{within an ace of giving a tragical one}
too.  

Imagine to yourself;\tsk but this had\break
better begin a new chapter.

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  IX.}

\initial[findent=1pt, nindent=6pt]{I}{Magine} to yourself a little, squat, uncourtly figure of a Doctor
\i{Slop}, of\break
about four feet and a half perpendicular
\natch{height,}
height, with a breadth of back, and a sesqui\-pedality of belly, which might have done honour to a serjeant in
the horse-guards.

Such were the out-lines of Dr.\@ \i{Slop}’s figure, which,\tsk if you have read
\i{Ho\-garth}’s analysis of beauty, and if you have not, I wish you would;\tsk
you must know,\break may as certainly be caracatur’d, and convey’d to the mind by three
strokes as three hundred.

Imagine such a one,\tsk for such, I say,
\stick{were the out-lines of Dr.\@ \i{Slop}’s figure,} 
\stick{coming slowly along, foot by foot, wad-}
\stick{dling thro’ the dirt upon the vertebræ} 
\stick{of a little diminutive pony,\tsk of a pretty}
\stick{colour;\tsk but of strength,\tsk alack!\tsh}
\stick{scarce able to have made an amble of it,}
\stick{under such a fardel, had the roads been}
\natch{in}
\stick{in an ambling condition.\tsh They were}
\stick{not.\tsh Imagine to yourself, \i{Obadiah}}
\stick{mounted upon a strong monster of a}
\stick{coach-horse, prick’d into a full gallop,}
\stick{and making all practicable speed the ad-}
verse way.

Pray, Sir, let me interest you a mo-\break ment in this description.

Had \drslop beheld \i{Obadiah} a mile\break
off, posting in a narrow lane directly to-\break
wards him, at that monstrous rate,\tsh\break
\stick{splashing and plunging like a devil thro’}
\stick{thick and thin, as he approach’d, would}
\stck{not such a phænomenon, with such a vor-}
\stick{tex of mud and water moving along with}
\stick{it, round its axis,\tsk have been a subject}
\stick{of juster apprehension to \drslop in his}
\stick{situation, than the \i{worst} of \i{Whiston}’s co-}
\stick{mets?\tsk To say nothing of the \textsc{Nucleus};}
\natch{that}
\stick{that is, of \i{Obadiah} and the coach-horse.}
\stick{\tsh In my idea, the vortex alone of}
\stick{’em was enough to have involved and} 
\stick{carried, if not the doctor, at least the}
\stick{doctor’s pony quite away with it. What}
\stick{then do you think must the terror and} 
\stick{hydrophobia of \drslop have been, when}
\stick{you read (which you are just going to} 
\stick{do) that he was advancing thus warily}
\stick{along towards \i{Shandy-Hall}, and had ap-}
\stick{proach’d to within sixty yards of it, and}
\stick{within five yards of a sudden turn, made}
\stick{by an acute angle of the garden-wall,}
\stick{\tsk and in the dirtiest part of a dirty lane,}
\stick{\tsk when \i{Obadiah} and his coach-horse} 
\stick{turn’d the corner, rapid, furious,\tsk pop,}
\stick{\tsk full upon him!\tsk Nothing, I think,}
\stick{in nature, can be supposed more terrible,}
\stick{than such a Rencounter,\tsk so imprompt!} 
\stick{so ill prepared to stand the shock of it as} 
\drslop was!
\patch{What}

What could \drslop do?\tsh He cross’d
\stick{himself ✝︎ \tsk Pugh!\tsk but the doctor,}
\stick{Sir, was a Papist.\tsk No matter; he had}
\stick{better have kept hold of the pummel.}
\stick{He had so;\tsk nay, as it happened, he had} 
\stick{better have done nothing at all;\tsk for in}
\stick{crossing himself he let go his whip,\tsk}
\stick{and in attempting to save his whip be-}
\stick{twixt his knee and his saddle’s skirt, as}
\stick{it slipp’d, he lost his stirrup,\tsk in losing} 
\stick{which, he lost his seat;\tsk and in the}
\stick{multitude of all these losses (which, by}
\stick{the bye, shews what little advantage}
\stick{there is in crossing) the unfortunate doc-}
\stick{tor lost his presence of mind. So that}
\stick{without waiting for \i{Obadiah}’s onset, he}
\stick{left his pony to its destiny, tumbling off} 
\stick{it diagonally, something in the stile and}
\stick{manner of a pack of wool, and without} 
\stick{any other consequence from the fall, save} 
\stick{that of being left (as it would have been)}
\natch{with}
\stick{with the broadest part of him sunk about}
twelve inches deep in the mire.

\i{Obadiah} pull’d off his cap twice to Dr.\@
\i{Slop};\tsh once as he was falling,\tsk and then again
when he saw him seated.\tsk Ill-\break timed
complaisance!\tsh had not the fel\-low better have stopp’d his
horse, and got\break off and help’d him?\tsk Sir, he did all that
his situation would allow;\tsk but the\break
\s{Momentum} of the coach-horse was so great, that \i{Obadiah} could not do it
all at once;\tsh he rode in a circle three times round \drslop,
before he could fully accomplish it any how;\tsk and at the last, when
he did stop his beast, ’twas done with such an explosion of
mud, that \i{Obadiah} had better have been a league
off.\break
In short, never was a \drslop so beluted, and so
transubstantiated, since that affair\break
came into fashion.\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  X.}

\dropcap{W}{hen} \drslop entered the back-\break
\tight{parlour, where my father and my}\break
\stick{uncle \toby were discoursing upon the na-}\break
\stick{ture of women,\tsh it was hard to deter-}
\stick{mine whether Dr.\@ \i{Slop}’s figure, or Dr.}
\stck{\i{Slop}’s presence, occasioned more surprize}
\stick{to them; for as the accident happened so}
\stick{near the house, as not to make it worth} 
\stick{while for \i{Obadiah} to remount him,\tsk}
\stick{\i{Obadiah} had led him in as he was, \i{un-}}
\stick{\i{wiped}, \i{unappointed}, \i{unanealed}, with all his}
\stick{stains and blotches on him.\tsh He}
\stick{stood like \i{Hamlet}’s ghost, motionless and}
\stick{speechless, for a full minute and a half,}
at the parlour door \i{(\sic Obadiah} still hold-
\stick{ing his hand) with all the majesty of mud.} 
\stick{His hinder parts, upon which he had re-}
\stick{ceived his fall, totally besmear’d,\tsk and}
\natch{in}
in every other part of him, blotched over in such a manner with
\i{Obadiah}’s explosion, that you would have sworn
(without mental reservation) that every grain of it had taken
effect.

Here was a fair opportunity for my 
\stick{uncle \toby to have triumph’d over my}
\stick{father in his turn;\tsk for no mortal, who} 
\stick{had beheld \drslop in that pickle, could}
\stick{have dissented from so much, at least, of}
\stick{my uncle \toby's opinion, \lqq That may-}
\stick{\lqq hap his sister might not care to let}
\stick{\lqq such a \drslop come so near her}
\stick{\lqq \wastiv\;” \quad But it was the \i{Argu-}}
\stick{\i{mentum ad hominem}; and if my uncle}
\stick{\toby was not very expert at it, you may}
\stick{think, he might not care to use it.\tsk}
\stick{No; the reason was,\tsk ’twas not his na-}
ture to insult.\patch{Dr.}

Dr.\@ \i{Slop}’s presence at that time, was no less
problematical than the mode of it; tho’, it is certain, one
moment’s reflection in my father might have solved it; for he
had apprized \drslop but the week before, that my mother was at her full reckoning;
and as the doctor had heard nothing since, ’twas natural and
very political too in him, to have taken a ride to
\i{Shandy-Hall}, as he did, merely\break to see how matters went
on.

But my father’s mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in
the investigation; running, like the hypercritic’s,
altogether
\stick{upon the ringing of the bell and the} 
\stick{rap upon the door,\tsk measuring their di-}
\stick{stance,\tsk and keeping his mind so intent} 
\stick{upon the operation, as to have power to}
\stick{think of nothing else,\tsk common-place} 
\stick{infirmity of the greatest mathematicians!}
\natch{work-}
working with might and main at the de\-monstration,
and so wasting all their\break strength upon it, that they have none left
in them to draw the corollary, to do\break good with.

The ringing of the bell, and the rap upon the door, struck
likewise strong\break
upon the sensorium of my uncle \toby,\tsk\break 
but it excited a very different train of
thoughts;\tsk the two irreconcileable pulsations instantly
brought \i{Stevinus}, the\break
\stick{great engineer, along with them, into}
my uncle \toby's mind:\tsk What business
\i{Stevinus} had in this affair,\tsk is the greatest
problem of all;\tsh it shall be solved,\tsk\break
but not in the next chapter.

\initial[findent=1pt]{W}{Riting}, when properly managed, (as
you may be sure I think mine is) is but a different name for
conversation: As no one, who knows what he is about in good
company, would venture to talk all;\tsk so no author, who
understands the just boundaries of decorum and good breeding, would
presume to think all: The truest respect which you can pay to the
reader’s understanding, is to halve this matter amicably, and
leave him something to imagine, in his turn,\break
as well as yourself.

For my own part, I am eternally paying him compliments of this
kind, and do all that lies in my power to keep his\break
imagination as busy as my own.\patch{’Tis}

’Tis his turn now;\tsk I have given an ample description of Dr.\@ \i{Slop}’s sad
overthrow, and of his sad appearance in the back-parlour;\tsk his
imagination must now go on with it for a while.

Let the reader imagine then, that \drslop has told his
tale;\tsk and in what words, and with what aggravations his fancy
chooses:\tsk Let him suppose, that \i{Obadiah} has told his
tale also, and with such rueful looks of affected concern,\break
as he thinks best will contrast the two\break
figures as they stand by each other:\tsk\break
Let him imagine, that my father has\break
stepp’d up stairs to see my mother.\tsk\break 
And, to conclude this work of imagination,\tsk let him
imagine the doctor wash’d,\break
\tsk rubb’d down,\tsk condoled with,\tsk\break
felicitated,\tsk got into a pair of \i{Obadiah}’s\break
pumps, stepping forwards towards the
\natch{door,}
door, upon the very point of entering\break
upon action.

Truce!\tsk truce, good Dr.\@ \i{Slop!}\tsk stay thy
obstetric hand;\tsk return it safe into thy bosom to keep
it warm;\tsk little dost thou know what obstacles;\tsk
little dost thou think what hidden causes retard its
operation!\tsk Hast thou, \drslop,\tsk hast thou
been intrusted with the secret ar-\break
\stick{ticles of the solemn treaty which has} 
brought thee into this place?\tsk Art thou aware
that, at this instant, a daughter of \i{Lucina} is put
obstetrically over thy head?\break
Alas! ’tis too true.\tsk
Besides, great son of \i{Pilumnus!} what canst thou
do?\tsh\break
Thou hast come forth unarm’d;\tsk thou hast left thy

\tsh Make great haste, \i{Obadiah}, quoth 
\stick{my father, and I’ll give thee a crown;\tsh}
\stick{and, quoth my uncle \toby, I’ll give him} 
another.

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  XII.}

\dropcap{Y}{our} sudden and unexpected ar-\break
rival, quoth my uncle \toby, ad-\break
dressing himself to \drslop,
(all three of them sitting down to the fire together, as my uncle
\toby began to speak)\tsk in-\break
stantly brought the great \i{Stevinus} into\break
my head, who, you must know, is a fa-
\natch{vourite}
\stick{vourite author with me.\tsh Then,}
added my father, making use of the ar\-gument \i{Ad
Crumenam},\tsh I will lay\break
twenty guineas to a single crown piece (which will serve to
give away to \i{Obadiah} when he gets back) that this
same \i{Stevinus} was some engineer or other,\tsk\break
or has wrote something or other, either directly or indirectly,
upon the science of\break
fortification.

He has so,\tsk replied my uncle \toby.\tsk\break
I knew it, said my father;\tsk tho’, for the soul of me, I cannot see what kind
of connection there can be betwixt Dr.\@ \i{Slop}’s sudden
coming, and a discourse upon fortification;\tsk yet I
fear’d it.\tsk\break
Talk of what we will, brother,\tsk or let the occasion be
never so foreign or unfit for the subject,\tsk you are sure
to bring it in: I would not, brother \toby, con-
\natch{tinued}
tinued my father,\tsh I declare I would not have my head
so full of curtins and horn-works.\tsh That, I dare say, you
would not, quoth \drslop, interrupting him, and
laughing most immoderately at\break
his pun.

\i{Dennis} the critic could not detest and abhor a pun, or
the insinuation of a pun, more cordially than my father;\tsh he
would grow testy upon it at any time;\tsk\break
\stick{but to be broke in upon by one, in a} 
\stick{serious discourse, was as bad, he would}
\stick{say, as a fillip upon the nose;\tsh he saw}
no difference.

Sir, quoth my uncle \toby, addressing himself to \drslop,\tsk 
the curtins my brother \i{Shandy} mentions
here, have no-\break
\stick{thing to do with bed-steads;\tsk tho’, I} know,
\i{Du Cange} says, \lqq That bed-cur-
\natch{\lqq tains,}
\stick{\lqq tains, in all probability, have taken}
\stick{\lqq their name from them;”\tsk nor have}
\stck{the horn-works, he speaks of, any thing in}
\stick{the world to do with the horn-works of}
\stick{cuckoldom:\tsk But the \i{curtin}, Sir, is the}
\stick{word we use in fortification, for that part} 
\stick{of the wall or rampart which lies between}
\stick{the two bastions and joins them.\tsh Be-}
\stick{siegers seldom offer to carry on their at-}
\stick{tacks directly against the curtin, for this}
\stick{reason, because they are so well \i{flanked}.}
\stick{(’Tis the case of other curtins, quoth Dr.}
\stick{\i{Slop}, laughing). However, continued my}
\stick{uncle \toby, to make them sure, we ge-}
\stick{nerally choose to place ravelins before} 
\stick{them, taking care only to extend them} 
\stick{beyond the fossé or ditch:\tsh The com-}
\stick{mon men, who know very little of for-}
\stick{tification, confound the ravelin and the} 
\stick{half-moon together,\tsk tho’ they are very} 
\stick{different things;\tsk not in their figure or}
\natch{con-}
\stick{construction, for we make them exactly} 
aliks\sic\ in all points;\tsk for they always con-\break
\stick{sist of two faces, making a salient angle,} 
\stick{with the gorges, not straight, but in} 
\stick{form of a crescent;\tsk Where then lies the} 
\stick{difference? (quoth my father, a little}
\stck{testily.)\tsk In their situations, answered my} 
\stick{uncle \i{Toby:}\tsk For when a ravelin, bro-}
\stick{ther, stands before the curtin, it is a ra-}
\stick{velin; and when a ravelin stands before} 
\stick{a bastion, then the ravelin is not a rave-}
\stick{lin;\tsk it is a half-moon;\tsk a half-moon} 
\stick{likewise is a half-moon, and no more, so}
\stick{long as it stands before its bastion;\tsk but}
\stick{was it to change place, and get before the}
\stick{curtin,\tsk ’twould be no longer a half-}
\stick{moon; a half-moon, in that case, is not}
\stick{a half-moon;\tsk ’tis no more than a rave-}
\stick{lin.\tsk I think, quoth my father, that the} 
\stick{noble science of defence has its weak} 
sides,\tsk as well as others.\patch{\tsk As}

\tsk As for the horn-works (high! ho! sigh’d my father)
which, continued my uncle \toby, my brother was speaking of,
they are a very considerable part of an 
\stick{outwork;\tsh they are called by the \i{French}}
engineers, \i{Ouvrage à
corne}, and we gene\-rally make them to cover such places as we
suspect to be weaker than the rest;\tsk\break 
’tis form’d by two
epaulments or demi-bastions\tsk they are very pretty, and
if you will take a walk, I’ll engage to shew you one well
worth your trouble.\tsh I own, continued my uncle \toby,
when we crown them,\tsk they are much stronger, but
then they are very expensive, and take up a great deal of
ground; so that,\break
in my opinion, they are most of use to\break
cover or defend the head of a camp;\break
otherwise the double tenaille\tsh By\break
the mother who bore us!\tsh brother
\natch{\toby,}
\stick{\toby, quoth my father, not able to hold}
\stick{out any longer,\tsk you would provoke a} 
\stick{saint;\tsk here have you got us, I know not} 
\stck{how, not only souse into the middle of the} 
\stick{old subject again:\tsk But so full is your}
\stick{head of these confounded works, that}
\stick{tho’ my wife is this moment in the pains}
\stick{of labour,\tsk and you hear her cry out,\tsk}
\stick{yet nothing will serve you but to carry}
\stick{off the man-midwife.\tsh \i{Accoucheur},\tsk}
\stick{if you please, quoth Dr.\@ \i{Slop.}\tsk With all} 
\stick{my heart, replied my father, I don’t care}
\stick{what they call you,\tsh but I wish the}
\stick{whole science of fortification, with all its}
\stick{inventors, at the devil;\tsk it has been the}
\stick{death of thousands,\tsk and it will be} 
\stick{mine, in the end.\tsk I would not, I would}
\stick{not, brother \toby, have my brains so full}
\stck{of saps, mines, blinds, gabions, palisadoes,} 
\stick{ravelins, half-moons, and such trum-}
\natch{pery,}
\stick{pery, to be proprietor of \i{Namur}, and of}
all the towns in \i{Flanders} with it.

My uncle \toby was a man patient of
\stick{injuries;\tsk not from want of courage,\tsk I}
\stick{have told you in the fifth chapter of this}
\stick{second book, \lqq That he was a man of}
\stick{\lqq courage:”\tsk And will add here, that}
\stick{where just occasions presented, or called} 
\stick{it forth,\tsk I know no man under whose}
\stick{arm I would have sooner taken shelter;}
\stick{nor did this arise from any insensibility}
\stick{or obtuseness of his intellectual parts;\tsk}
\stick{for he felt this insult of my father’s as} 
\stick{feelingly as a man could do;\tsk but he}
\stick{was of a peaceful, placid nature,\tsk no}
\stick{jarring element in it,\tsk all was mix’d up}
\stick{so kindly within him; my uncle \i{Toby}}
\stick{had scarce a heart to retaliate upon}
a fly.\patch{\tsk Go}

\tsk Go\tsk says he, one day at dinner, to
\stick{an over-grown one which had buzz’d} 
\stick{about his nose, and tormented him cruel-}
\stick{ly all dinner-time,\tsk and which, after in-}
\stick{finite attempts, he had caught at last, as}
\stick{it flew by him;\tsk I’ll not hurt thee, says}
\stick{my uncle \toby, rising from his chair, and}
\stick{going a-cross the room, with the fly in}
\stick{his hand,\tsk I’ll not hurt a hair of thy} 
\stick{head:\tsk Go, says he, lifting up the sash,}
\stick{and opening his hand as he spoke, to let}
\stick{it escape;\tsk go poor devil, get thee gone,}
\stick{why should I hurt thee?\tsh This world} 
\stick{surely is wide enough to hold both thee}
and me.

I was but ten years old when this hap-
\stick{pened;\tsk but whether it was, that the} 
\stick{action itself was more in unison to my} 
\stick{nerves at that age of pity, which instant-}
\stick{ly set my whole frame into one vibration}
\natch{of}
\stick{of most pleasurable sensation;\tsk or how} 
\stick{far the manner and expression of it might} 
\stick{go towards it;\tsk or in what degree, or}
\stick{by what secret magic,\tsk a tone of voice}
\stick{and harmony of movement, attuned by}
\stick{mercy, might find a passage to my heart,}
\stick{I know not;\tsk this I know, that the lesson}
\stick{of universal good-will then taught and} 
\stick{imprinted by my uncle \toby, has never} 
\stick{since been worn out of my mind: And} 
\stck{tho’ I would not depreciate what the study}
\stck{of the \i{Literæ humaniores}, at the university,}
\stick{have done for me in that respect, or dis-}
\stck{credit the other helps of an expensive edu-}
\stick{cation bestowed upon me, both at home}
\stick{and abroad since;\tsk yet I often think that} 
\stick{I owe one half of my philanthropy to} 
that one accidental impression.

\indent\fist This is to serve for parents and\break
governors instead of a whole volume\break 
upon the subject.\etp\patch{I}

I could not give the reader this stroke in my uncle
\toby's picture, by the instrument with which I drew
the other parts of it,\tsh that taking in no more than
\stick{the mere
\s{Hobby-Horsical} likeness;}\break\tsh this
is a part of his moral character. My father, in this patient
endurance of wrongs, which I mention, was very different, as the
reader must long ago have noted; he had a much more acute and quick
sensibility of nature, attended with a little soreness of temper;
tho’ this\break 
\stck{never transported him to any thing which} looked
like malignancy;\tsh yet in the little rubs and vexations of
life, ’twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty kind of
peevishness:\tsh He was, however, frank and generous in
his nature;\break
\stick{\tsh at all times open to conviction;}
and in the little ebullitions of this sub\-acid humour towards others, but
parti-
\natch{cularly}
\stick{cularly towards my uncle \toby, whom} 
\stick{he truly loved:\tsh he would feel more} 
\stick{pain, ten times told (except in the af-}
\stick{fair of my aunt \i{Dinah}, or where an hy-}
\stick{pothesis was concerned) than what he} 
ever gave.

The characters of the two brothers, in this view of them,
reflected light upon each other, and appear’d with great advantage
in this affair which arose about \i{Stevinus.}

I need not tell the reader, if he keeps a
\stick{\s{Hobby-Horse},\tsk that a man’s \textscl{Hobby-}}
\stick{\s{Horse} is as tender a part as he has}
\stick{about him; and that these unprovoked} 
\stick{strokes, at my uncle \toby's could not be}
\stick{unfelt by him.\tsk No;\tsk as I said above,}
\stick{my uncle \toby did feel them, and very}
sensibly too.\patch{Pray,}

Pray, Sir, what said he?\tsk How did\break
he behave?\tsk Oh, Sir!\tsk it was great:\break 
For as soon as my father had done in\-sulting his
\s{Hobby-Horse},\tsh he turned
his head, without the least emotion,\break
from \drslop, to whom he was addres\-sing his discourse, and look’d up into my
father’s face, with a countenance spread over with so much
good nature;\tsh so placid;\tsk so
fraternal;\tsk so inexpressibly tender towards
him;\tsk it penetrated my father to his heart: He rose up hastily
from his chair, and seizing hold of both my uncle
\toby's hands as he spoke:\tsh\break
Brother \toby, said he,\tsk I beg thy pardon;\tsk forgive, I pray thee,
this rash humour which my mother gave me.\tsk\break
\stick{My dear, dear brother, answer’d my} 
\stick{uncle \toby, rising up by my father’s help,} 
\stick{say no more about it;\tsk you are heartily}
\stick{welcome, had it been ten times as much,}
\natch{brother.}
\stick{brother. But ’tis ungenerous, replied}
\stick{my father, to hurt any man;\tsh a brother}
\stick{worse;\tsk but to hurt a brother of such}
\stick{gentle manners,\tsk so unprovoking,\tsk and}
\stick{so unresenting;\tsk ’tis base:\tsk By heaven,}
\stick{’tis cowardly.\tsh You are heartily wel-}
\stick{come, brother, quoth my uncle \toby,\tsk}
\stick{had it been fifty times as much.\tsh}
\stick{Besides, what have I to do, my dear \toby,}
\stick{cried my father, either with your amuse-}
\stick{ments or your pleasures, unless it was in}
\stick{my power (which it is not) to increase}
their measure?

\tsk Brother \i{Shandy}, answer’d my uncle
\stick{\toby, looking wistfully in his face,\tsk you} 
\stick{are much mistaken in this point;\tsk for} 
\stick{you do increase my pleasure very much,} 
\stick{in begetting children for the \i{Shandy} fa-}
\stick{mily at your time of life.\tsh But, by} 
\stick{that, Sir, quoth \drslop, Mr.\@ \i{Shandy} in-}

my father.

\toby, out of \i{principle.}\tsh In a fa-\break
mily-way, I suppose, quoth Dr.\@ \i{Slop.}\tsh\break
Pshaw!\tsk said my father,\tsk ’tis not worth\break
talking of.

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  XIV.}

\dropcap[findent=1pt]{A}{t} the end of the last chapter, my\break
father and my uncle \toby were\break
left both standing, like \i{Brutus} and \i{Cassius}\break
at the close of the scene making up their\break
accounts.\patch{As}

\tight{As my father spoke the three last words,}\break
\tsk he sat down;\tsk my uncle \toby
exactly followed his example, only, that before he took his chair, he rung the bell,
to order Corporal \trim, who was in waiting, to step home for
\i{Stevinus};\tsk my uncle 
\stck{\toby's house being no further off than the}
opposite side of the way.

Some men would have dropp’d the subject of
\i{Stevinus};\tsk but my uncle \toby had no resentment
in his heart, and he went on with the subject, to shew my father
that he had none.

Your sudden appearance, \drslop,\break
quoth my uncle,
resuming the discourse, instantly brought \i{Stevinus} into my
head. (My father, you may be sure, did not offer to lay any more
wagers upon \i{Ste\-vinus}’s head.)\tsh Because, continued my
\natch{uncle}
\stick{uncle \toby, the celebrated sailing chariot,}
\stick{which belonged to Prince \i{Maurice}, and}
\stick{was of such wonderful contrivance and}
\stick{velocity, as to carry half a dozen peo-}
\stick{ple thirty \i{German} miles, in I don’t know} 
\stick{how few minutes,\tsh was invented by}
\stick{\i{Stevinus}, that great mathematician and} 
engineer.

You might have spared your servant
\stick{the trouble, quoth \drslop (as the fellow}
\stick{is lame) of going for \i{Stevinus}’s account} 
\stick{of it, because, in my return from \i{Leyden}}
\stick{thro’ the \i{Hague}, I walked as far as \i{Schev}-}
\stick{\i{ling}, which is two long miles, on purpose}
to take a view of it.

\tsk That’s nothing, replied my uncle 
\stick{\toby, to what the learned \i{Peireskius} did,} 
\stick{who walked a matter of five hundred}
\stick{miles, reckoning from \i{Paris} to \i{Schevling},}
\natch{and}
\stick{and from \i{Schevling} to \i{Paris} back again,}
in order to see it,\tsk and nothing else.

Some men cannot bear to be out-gone.

The more fool \i{Peireskius}, replied Dr.
\stick{\i{Slop.} But mark, ’twas out of no con-}
\stick{tempt of \i{Peireskius} at all;\tsh but that}
\stick{\i{Peireskius}’s indefatigable labour in trudg-}
\stick{ing so far on foot, out of love for the} 
\stick{sciences, reduced the exploit of \drslop,}
\stick{in that affair, to nothing;\tsk the more fool} 
\stick{\i{Peireskius}, said he again:\tsk Why so?\tsk}
\stick{replied my father, taking his brother’s} 
\stick{part, not only to make reparation as fast}
\stick{as he could for the insult he had given} 
\stick{him, which sat still upon my father’s}
\stick{mind;\tsk but partly, that my father began} 
\stick{really to interest himself in the discourse.}
\stick{\tsk Why so?\tsk said he. Why is \i{Peireskius},}
or any man else, to be abused for an ap-
\natch{petite}
petite for that, or any other morsel of
sound knowledge? For notwithstand-\break
ing I know nothing of the chariot in\break
question, continued he, the inventor of it must have had a very mechanical head;\break
and tho’ I cannot guess upon what prin\-ciples of philosophy he has atchiev’d\break
it;\tsh yet certainly his machine has\break
been constructed upon solid ones, be\break
they what they will, or it could not\break
have answer’d at the rate my brother\break
mentions.

It answered, replied my uncle \toby,\break
as well, if not better; for, as \i{Peireskius}\break
elegantly expresses it, speaking of the\break
velocity of its motion, \i{Tam citus erat},\break
\i{quam erat ventus}; which, unless I have\break
forgot my Latin, is, \i{that it was as swift}\break 
\i{as the wind itself}.\patch{But}

But pray, \drslop, quoth my father,\break
interrupting my uncle (tho’ not with-\break
out begging pardon for it, at the same
time) upon what principles was this self-\break
same chariot set a-going?\tsk Upon very pretty principles to be sure, replied
Dr.\break
\stick{\i{Slop};\tsh and I have often wondered,}\break
continued he, evading
the question, why none of our gentry, who live upon large plains
like this of ours,\tsk (especially they whose wives are not past
child-bearing) attempt nothing of this kind; for it\break
would not only be infinitely expeditious\break
upon sudden calls, to which the sex is\break
subject,\tsk if the wind only served,\tsk but\break 
would be excellent good husbandry to\break
make use of the winds, which cost no-\break
thing, and which eat nothing, rather\break
than horses, which (the devil take ’em)\break 
both cost and eat a great deal.\patch{For}

For that very reason, replied my father,
\lqq Because they cost nothing, and\break
\lqq because they eat nothing,”\tsk the scheme\break
is bad;\tsk it is the
consumption of our products, as well as the manufactures of them,
which gives bread to the hungry, circulates trade,\tsk brings in
money, and supports the value of our lands;\tsk and tho’, I
own, if I was a prince, I would
ge\-nerously recompense the scientific head which brought
forth such contrivances;\break\tsk yet I
would as peremptorily suppress the use of them.

My father here had got into his element,\tsh and was going on
as pros\-per\-ously with his dissertation upon trade, as my uncle
\toby had before, upon his\break 
of fortification;\tsh but, to the loss\break
of much sound knowledge, the destinies in the morning had
decreed that no
\natch{dis-}
dissertation of any kind should be spun
\stick{by my father that day,\tsh for as}
\stick{he opened his mouth to begin the next}\break sentence,

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  XV.}

\dropcap{I}{n} popp’d Corporal \trim with
\i{Stevinus:}\tsk But ’twas too late,\tsk all the\break
\stk{discourse had been exhausted without him,}
and was running into a new channel.

\tsk You may take the book home again, \trim, said my
uncle \toby, nodding to\break him.

But pri’thee, Corporal, quoth my father, drolling,\tsk look
first into it, and see if thou canst spy aught of a
sailing\break
chariot in it.\patch{Corporal}

Corporal \trim, by being in the service,\break
\stick{had learned to obey,\tsk and not to re-}
\stick{monstrate,\tsk so taking the book to a}
\stick{side-table, and running over the leaves;} 
\stick{an’ please your Honour, said \trim, I can}
\stick{see no such thing;\tsk however, continued} 
\stick{the Corporal, drolling a little in his turn,} 
\stick{I’ll make sure work of it, an’ please your}
\stick{Honour;\tsk so taking hold of the two}
\stick{covers of the book, one in each hand,} 
\stick{and letting the leaves fall down, as he}
\stick{bent the covers back, he gave the book}
a good sound shake.

There is something fallen out, how-
\stick{ever, said \trim, an’ please your Honour;}
\stick{but it is not a chariot, or any thing like}
\stick{one:\tsk Pri’thee, Corporal, said my father,} 
\stick{smiling, what is it then?\tsk I think, an-}
\stick{swered \trim, stooping to take it up,\tsk}
\stick{’tis more like a sermon,\tsk for it begins,}
\natch{with}
\stick{with a text of scripture, and the chapter} 
\stick{and verse;\tsk and then goes on, not as a} 
chariot, but like a sermon directly.

The company smiled.

I cannot conceive how it is possible,\break
quoth my uncle \toby, for such a thing as\break
a sermon to have got into my \i{Stevinus.}

I think ’tis a sermon, replied \trim;\tsk\break
\stick{but if it please your Honours, as it is a}
\stick{fair hand, I will read you a page;\tsk for}
\stick{\trim, you must know, loved to hear}
himself read almost as well as talk.

I have ever a strong propensity, said 
\stick{my father, to look into things which} 
\stick{cross my way, by such strange fatalities}
\stick{as these;\tsk and as we have nothing bet-}
\stick{ter to do, at least till \i{Obadiah} gets back,}
\natch{I}
\stick{I should be obliged to you, brother, if}
\stick{\drslop has no objection to it, to order}
\stick{the Corporal to give us a page or two of}
\stick{it,\tsk if he is as able to do it, as he seems} 
\stick{willing. An’ please your Honour, quoth} 
\stick{\trim, I officiated two whole campaigns}
\stick{in \i{Flanders}, as clerk to the chaplain of}
\stick{the regiment.\tsk He can read it, quoth}
\stick{my uncle \toby, as well as I can.\tsk \trim,}
\stick{I assure you, was the best scholar in my} 
\stick{company, and should have had the next} 
\stick{halberd, but for the poor fellow’s mis-}
\stick{fortune. Corporal \trim laid his hand}
\stick{upon his heart, and made an humble bow} 
\stick{to his master;\tsk then laying down his hat} 
\stick{upon the floor, and taking up the sermon}
\stick{in his left-hand, in order to have his} 
\stick{right at liberty,\tsk he advanced, nothing} 
\stick{doubting, into the middle of the room,} 
\stick{where he could best see, and be best seen}
by, his audience.\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  XVI.}

\quad\tsh If you have any objection,\tsk said
\stick{my father, addressing himself to \drslop.}
\stick{Not in the least, replied \drslop;\tsk for}
\stick{it does not appear on which side of the} 
\stick{question it is wrote;\tsk it may be a} 
\stick{composition of a divine of our church,} 
\stick{as well as yours,\tsk so that we run equal}
\stick{risks.\tsh ’Tis wrote upon neither side,} 
\stick{quoth \trim, for ’tis only upon \i{Conscience},}
an’ please your Honours.

\trim's reason put his audience into
\stick{good humour,\tsk all but \drslop, who,}
\stick{turning his head about towards \trim,}
look’d a little angry.

Begin, \trim,\tsh and read distinctly, 
\stick{quoth my father;\tsk I will, an’ please your}
\natch{Honour,}
\stick{Honour, replied the Corporal, making a}
\stick{bow, and bespeaking attention with a}
slight movement of his right-hand.

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  XVII.}

\quad\tsh But before the Corporal begins,
\stick{I must first give you a description of his}
\stick{attitude;\tsh otherwise he will naturally} 
\stick{stand represented, by your imagination,} 
\stick{in an uneasy posture,\tsk stiff,\tsk perpendi-}
\stick{cular,\tsk dividing the weight of his body}
\stick{equally upon both legs;\tsh his eye fix’d,}
\stick{as if on duty;\tsk his look determined,\tsk}
\stick{clinching the sermon in his left-hand,}
\stick{like his firelock:\tsk In a word, you would} 
\stick{be apt to paint \trim, as if he was stand-}
\stick{ing in his platoon ready for action:\tsh}
\stick{His attitude was as unlike all this as you}
can conceive.\patch{He}

He stood before them with his body
\stick{swayed, and bent forwards just so far, as}
to make an angle of 85 degrees and a half upon the
plain of the horizon;\tsh\break which sound orators, to whom I address
this, know very well, to be the true per\-suasive angle of
incidence;\tsk in any other angle you may talk and
preach;\tsk ’tis certain,\tsk and it is done every
day;\tsk\break but with what effect,\tsk I leave the world to
judge!

The necessity of this precise angle of 85 degrees and a half to
a mathematical exactness,\tsk does it not shew us, by the
way,\tsk how the arts and sciences mutually befriend each other?

How the duce Corporal \trim, who\break
knew not so much as an acute angle\break
from an obtuse one, came to hit it so ex-
\natch{actly;}
actly;\tsh or whether it was chance or nature, or good
sense or imitation, \etc\break shall be commented upon in that part of
the cyclopædia of arts and sciences, where the instrumental
parts of the eloquence of the senate, the pulpit, the bar, the
coffee-house, the bed-chamber, and fire-side, fall under
consideration.

He stood,\tsh for I repeat it, to take
\stick{the picture of him in at one view, with}
\stick{his body sway’d, and somewhat bent} 
\stick{forwards,\tsk his right-leg firm under him,} 
\stick{sustaining seven\,-\,eighths of his whole}
\stick{weight,\tsk the foot of his left-leg, the de-}
\stick{fect of which was no disadvantage to his}
\stick{attitude, advanced a little,\tsk not lateral-}
\stick{ly, nor forwards, but in a line betwixt} 
\stick{them;\tsk his knee bent, but that not vio-}
\stick{lently,\tsk but so as to fall within the li-}
\stick{mits of the line of beauty;\tsk and I add,}
\natch{of}
\stick{of the line of science too;\tsk for consider,} 
\stick{it had one eighth part of his body to} 
\stick{bear up;\tsk so that in this case the posi-}
\stick{tion of the leg is determined,\tsk because}
\stick{the foot could be no further advanced,} 
\stick{or the knee more bent, than what would}
\stick{allow him mechanically, to receive an} 
\stick{eighth part of his whole weight under}
it,\tsk and to carry it too.

\indent\fist This I recommend to painters?\tsk\break
need I add,\tsk to orators?\tsk I think not;\break
for unless they practise it,\tsh they must\break
fall upon their noses.

So much for Corporal \trim's body and
legs.\tsk He held the sermon loosely,\tsk not carelessly, in
his left-hand, raised something above his stomach, and detach’d a
little from his breast;\tsh his right-arm
\stick{falling negligently by his side, as nature}
\natch{and}
\stick{and the laws of gravity ordered it,\tsh but}
\stick{with the palm of it open and turned to-}
\stick{wards his audience, ready to aid the sen-}
timent, in case it stood in need.

\tight{Corporal \trim's eyes and the muscles of}
\stick{his face were in full harmony with the} 
\stick{other parts of him;\tsk he look’d frank,\tsk}
\stick{unconstrained,\tsk something assured,\tsh}
but not bordering upon assurance.

Let not the critic ask how Corporal 
\stick{\trim could come by all this. I’ve told} 
\stick{him it shall be explained;\tsk but so he}
\stick{stood before my father, my uncle \toby,}
\stick{and \drslop,\tsk so swayed his body, so} 
\stick{contrasted his limbs, and with such an} 
\stick{oratorical sweep throughout the whole}
\stick{figure,\tsh a statuary might have modell’d} 
\stick{from it;\tsh nay, I doubt whether the} 
\stick{oldest Fellow of a College,\tsk or the \i{He}-}
\natch{\i{brew}
}
\stick{\i{brew} Professor himself, could have much}
mended it.

\trim made a bow, and read as follows:

[Certainly, \trim, quoth my father, interrupting him, you
give that sentence a very improper accent; for you curl up your
nose, man, and read it with such a sneering tone, as if the Parson
was going to abuse the Apostle.\patch{He}

He is, an’ please your Honour, replied \trim.\quad Pugh!
said my father, smiling.

Sir, quoth Dr.\@ \i{Slop, Trim} is certainly in the right; for
the writer (who I perceive is a Protestant) by the snappish
\stick{manner in which he takes up the Apostle,}
\stick{is certainly going to abuse him,\tsk if this}

\stick{him, if he went on at that rate, would} 
\stick{be flung into the Inquisition for his pains.}
\stick{God help him then, quoth my uncle} 
\stick{\toby. Amen, added \trim; for, heaven} 
\stick{above knows, I have a poor brother who}

\stick{went over a servant to \i{Lisbon},\tsk and then} 
\stick{married a \i{Jew}’s widow, who kept a small} 
\stck{shop, and sold sausages, which, some how} 
\stick{or other, was the cause of his being taken} 
\stick{in the middle of the night out of his} 
\stick{bed, where he was lying with his wife} 
\stick{and two small children, and carried di-}
\stick{rectly to the Inquisition, where, God help}
\stick{him, continued \trim, fetching a sigh from}

\stick{nest lad lies confined at this hour;\tsh}
\stick{he was as honest a soul, added \trim,}
\natch{(pulling}

\tsh The tears trickled down \trim's cheeks faster
than he could well wipe them away.\tsk A dead silence in the room

well, quoth my father.]

\lqq Now,\tsk as conscience is nothing else\break
\lqq but the knowledge which the mind has\break
\lqq within herself of this; and the judg-\break
\lqq ment, either of approbation or censure,\break
\lqq which it unavoidably makes upon the\break
\lqq successive actions of our lives; ’tis plain\break
\lqq you will say, from the very terms of\break
\lqq the proposition,\tsk whenever this inward\break
\lqq testimony goes against a man, and he\break
\lqq stands self-accused,\tsk that he must ne-\break
\lqq cessarily be a guilty man.\tsk And, on\break
\lqq the contrary, when the report is fa-\break
\lqq vourable on his side, and his heart con-
\natch{\lqq demns}
\lqq demns him not;\tsh that it is not a\break
\lqq matter of \i{trust}, as the Apostle intimates,\break
\lqq \tsk but a matter of \i{certainty} and fact,\break
\lqq that the conscience is good, and that\break
\lqq the man must be good also.”

[Then the Apostle is altogether in the 
\stick{wrong, I suppose, quoth \drslop, and}
\stick{the Protestant divine is in the right. Sir,}
\stick{have patience, replied my father, for I} 
\stick{think it will presently appear that St.\@ \i{Paul}}
\stick{and the Protestant divine are both of an}
\stick{opinion.\tsk As nearly so, quoth \drslop,} 
\stick{as east is to west;\tsk but this, continued}
\stick{he, lifting both hands, comes from the}
liberty of the press.

It is no more, at the worst, replied my
\stick{uncle \toby, than the liberty of the pulpit;} 
\stick{for it does not appear that the sermon is}
printed, or ever likely to be.\patch{Go}

Go on, \trim, quoth my father.]

\lqq At first sight this may seem to be a\break
\lqq true state of the case: and I make no\break
\lqq doubt but the knowledge of right and\break
\lqq wrong is so truly impressed upon the\break
\lqq mind of man,\tsk that did no such thing\break
\lqq ever happen, as that the conscience of\break
\lqq a man, by long habits of sin, might\break
\lqq (as the scripture assures it may) insen-\break
\lqq sibly become hard;\tsk and, like some\break
\lqq tender parts of his body, by much\break
\lqq stress and continual hard usage, lose,\break
\lqq by degrees, that nice sense and per-\break
\lqq ception with which God and nature\break 
\lqq endow’d it:\tsk Did this never happen;\break
\lqq \tsk or was it certain that self-love could\break
\lqq never hang the least bias upon the\break 
\lqq judgment;\tsk or that the little interests\break 
\lqq below, could rise up and perplex the\break
\lqq faculties of our upper regions, and
\natch{\lqq en-}
\lqq encompass them about with clouds and\break
\lqq thick darkness:\tsh Could no such\break
\lqq thing as favour and affection enter this\break
\lqq sacred \s{Court}:\tsk  Did \textscl{Wit} disdain to\break
\lqq take a bribe in it;\tsk or was asham’d to\break
\lqq shew its face as an advocate for an\break
\lqq unwarrantable enjoyment:\tsk Or, lastly,\break
\lqq were we assured, that \s{Interest} stood\break
\lqq always unconcern’d whilst the cause\break
\lqq was hearing\tsk and that passion never\break
\lqq got into the judgment-seat, and pro-\break
\lqq nounc’d sentence in the stead of reason,\break
\lqq which is supposed always to preside\break
\lqq and determine upon the case:\tsk Was\break
\lqq this truly so, as the objection must\break
\lqq suppose;\tsk no doubt then, the religious\break
\lqq and moral state of a man would be\break
\lqq exactly what he himself esteem’d it;\tsk\break
\lqq and the guilt or innocence of every\break
\lqq man’s life could be known, in general,\break
\lqq by no better measure, than the de-
\natch{\lqq grees}
\lqq grees of his own approbation and cen-\break
\lqq sure.

\lqq I own, in one case, whenever a man’s\break
\lqq conscience does accuse him (as it sel-\break
\lqq dom errs on that side) that he is guil-\break
\lqq ty; and, unless in melancholy and hy-\break
\lqq pocondriac cases, we may safely pro-\break
\lqq nounce upon it, that there is always\break
\lqq sufficient grounds for the accusation.

\lqq But the converse of the proposition\break
\lqq will not hold true;\tsh namely, that\break
\lqq whenever there is guilt, the conscience\break
\lqq must accuse; and if it does not, that\break
\lqq a man is therefore innocent.\tsk This is\break
\lqq not fact:\tsk So that the common con-\break
\lqq solation which some good christian or\break
\lqq other is hourly administering to him-\break
\lqq self,\tsk that he thanks God his mind\break
\lqq does not misgive him; and that, con-
\natch{\lqq sequently,}
\lqq sequently, he has a good conscience,\break
\lqq because he hath a quiet one,\tsk is falla-\break
\lqq cious;\tsk and as current as the inference\break
\lqq is, and as infallible as the rule appears\break
\lqq at first sight, yet, when you look nearer\break
\lqq to it, and try the truth of this rule\break
\lqq upon plain facts,\tsk you see it liable to\break
\lqq so much error from a false application;\break
\lqq \tsk the principle upon which it goes so\break
\lqq often perverted;\tsk the whole force of\break
\lqq it lost, and sometimes so vilely cast\break
\lqq away, that it is painful to produce the\break
\lqq common examples from human life\break
\lqq which confirm the account.

\lqq A man shall be vicious and utterly\break
\lqq debauched in his principles;\tsk excep-\break
\lqq tionable in his conduct to the world;\break
\lqq shall live shameless, in the open com-\break
\lqq mission of a sin which no reason or pre-\break
\lqq tence can justify;\tsk a sin, by which
\natch{\lqq con-}
\lqq contrary to all the workings of huma-\break
\lqq nity, he shall ruin for ever the deluded\break
\lqq partner of his guilt;\tsk rob her of her\break
\stick{\lqq best dowry; and not only cover her own}\break
\lqq head with dishonour,\tsk but involve a\break
\lqq whole virtuous family in shame and\break
\lqq sorrow for her sake. Surely, you will\break
\lqq think conscience must lead such a man\break
\lqq a troublesome life; he can have no\break
\lqq rest night or day from its reproaches.

\lqq Alas! \s{Conscience} had something\break
\lqq else to do, all this time, than break in\break
\lqq upon him; as \i{Elijah} reproached the\break
\lqq God \i{Baal},\tsh this domestic God \i{was}\break
\lqq \i{either talking, or pursuing, or was in a}\break
\lqq \i{journey, or peradventure he slept and}\break
\lqq \i{could not be awoke.}

\lqq Perhaps \s{He} was gone out in com-\break
\lqq pany with \s{Honour} to fight a duel;
\natch{\lqq to}
\lqq to pay off some debt at play;\tsh or\break
\lqq dirty annuity, the bargain of his lust;\break
\lqq Perhaps \s{Conscience} all this time was\break
\lqq engaged at home, talking loud against\break
\lqq petty larceny, and executing vengeance\break
\lqq upon some such puny crimes as his\break
\lqq fortune and rank of life secured him\break
\lqq against all temptation of committing;\break
\lqq so that he lives as merrily,” [If he was\break
of our church, tho’, quoth \drslop, he\break
could not]\tsk \lqq sleeps as soundly in his\break
\lqq bed;\tsk and at last meets death as un-\break
\lqq concernedly;\tsk perhaps much more so\break
\lqq than a much better man.”

All this is impossible with us, quoth Dr.\@
\i{Slop}, turning to my father,\tsk the case could
not happen in our church.\tsh It\break
happens in ours,
however, replied my father, but too often.\tsh I own,
quoth Dr.\break \i{Slop} (struck a little with my
father’s
\natch{frank}
frank acknowledgment)\tsk that a man in the
\i{Romish} church may live as badly;\tsk\break but
then he cannot easily die so.\tsh ’Tis little matter,
replied my father, with an air of indifference,\tsk how
a rascal dies.\tsk\break I mean, answer’d \drslop,
he would be denied the benefits of the last
sacraments.\break
\tsk Pray how many have you in all, said my uncle
\toby,\tsk for I always forget?\tsk\break
Seven, answered \drslop.\tsk
Humph!\tsk\break said my
uncle \toby;\tsk tho’ not accented as a note of
acquiescence,\tsk but as an interjection of that
particular species of surprize, when a man in looking
into a drawer, finds more of a thing than he
ex-\break pected.\tsk Humph! replied my uncle \toby.
\drslop, who had an ear, understood my uncle
\toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume
against the seven sacraments.\tsh Humph! replied Dr.\@
\i{Slop}, (stating my uncle \toby's
argument over
\natch{again}
again to him)\tsh Why, Sir, are there not
seven cardinal virtues?\tsh Seven mortal sins?\tsh Seven
golden candlesticks?\tsh Seven heavens?\tsh ’Tis\break
more than I know, replied my uncle\break
\toby.\tsh Are
there not seven wonders of the world?\tsh Seven days of
the creation?\tsh Seven planets?\tsh Seven plagues?\tsh
That there are, quoth my father, with a most affected
gravity. But pri’thee, continued he, go on with the rest
of thy characters, \trim.]

\lqq life without a sigh or a prayer.\,” [And
\natch{please}
please your honours, cried
\trim, I think this a viler man than the other.]

\lqq \tight{Shall not conscience rise up and sting}\break
\lqq him on such occasions?\tsh No; thank\break
\lqq God there is no occasion; \i{I pay every}\break
\lqq \i{man his own};\i{\tsk I have no fornication to}\break
\lqq \i{answer to my conscience};\i{\tsk no faithless}\break

\lqq A third is crafty and designing in\break
\lqq his nature. View his whole life;\tsk ’tis\break
\lqq nothing but a cunning contexture of\break
\lqq dark arts and unequitable subterfuges,\break
\lqq basely to defeat the true intent of all\break

\natch{\lqq You}
\lqq You will see such a one working out\break
\lqq a frame of little designs upon the ig-\break
\lqq norance and perplexities of the poor\break
\lqq and needy man;\tsk shall raise a fortune\break
\lqq upon the inexperience of a youth, or\break
\lqq the unsuspecting temper of his friend,\break
\lqq who would have trusted him with his\break
\lqq life.

\lqq When old age comes on, and re-\break
\lqq pentance calls him to look back upon\break
\lqq this black account, and state it over\break
\lqq again with his conscience,\tsh \s{Con}-\break
\lqq \s{science} looks into the \textscl{Statutes} at\break

[Here Corporal \trim and my uncle \toby exchanged
looks with each other.\tsk\break
Aye, \tsk aye, \i{Trim!} quoth my uncle \toby, shaking
his head,\tsk these are but sorry fortifications,
\trim.\tsh O! very poor work, answered \trim, to

\lqq A fourth man shall want even this\break
\lqq refuge;\tsk shall break through all this\break
\lqq ceremony of slow chicane;\tsk scorns\break
\lqq the doubtful workings of secret plots\break
\lqq and cautious trains to bring about his\break
\lqq purpose:\tsh See the bare-faced villain,\break
\lqq how he cheats, lies, perjures, robs,\break
\lqq murders.\tsh Horrid!\tsh But indeed\break
\lqq much better was not to be expected,\break
\lqq in the present case,\tsk the poor man\break
\lqq was in the dark!\tsk his priest had got
\natch{\lqq the}
\lqq the keeping of his conscience;\tsk and\break
\lqq all he would let him know of it, was,\break
\lqq That he must believe in the Pope;\tsk\break
\lqq go to Mass;\tsk cross himself;\tsk tell his\break
\lqq beads;\tsh be a good Catholic, and\break
\lqq that this, in all conscience, was enough\break
\lqq to carry him to heaven.  What;\tsk if\break
\lqq he perjures!\tsk Why;\tsk he had a men-\break
\lqq tal reservation in it.\tsk But if he is so\break
\lqq wicked and abandoned a wretch as\break
\lqq you represent him;\tsk if he robs,\tsk if\break
\lqq he stabs,\tsk will not conscience, on every 
\lqq such act, receive a wound itself? Aye,\break
\lqq \tsk but the man has carried it to con-\break
\lqq fession;\tsk the wound digests there,\break
\lqq and will do well enough, and in a\break
\lqq short time be quite healed up by ab-\break
\lqq solution. O Popery! what hast thou\break
\lqq to answer for?\tsk when, not content\break
\lqq with the too many natural and fatal\break
\lqq ways, thro’ which the heart of man is
\natch{\lqq every}
\lqq every day thus treacherous to itself\break
\lqq above all things;\tsk thou hast wilfully\break
\lqq set open the wide gate of deceit before\break
\lqq the face of this unwary traveller, too\break
\lqq apt, God knows, to go astray of him-\break
\lqq self; and confidently speak peace to\break
\lqq himself, when there is no peace.

\lqq Of this the common instances which\break
\lqq I have drawn out of life, are too no-\break
\lqq torious to require much evidence. If\break
\lqq any man doubts the reality of them,\break
\lqq or thinks it impossible for a man to be\break
\lqq such a bubble to himself,\tsk I must refer\break
\lqq him a moment to his own reflections,\break
\lqq and will then venture to trust my ap-\break
\lqq peal with his own heart.  

\lqq Let him consider in how different\break
\lqq a degree of detestation, numbers of\break
\lqq wicked actions stand \i{there}, tho’ equally
\natch{\lqq bad}
\lqq bad and vicious in their own natures;\break
\lqq \tsk he will soon find, that such of them,\break
\lqq as strong inclination and custom have\break
\lqq prompted him to commit, are gene-\break
\lqq rally dress’d out and painted with all\break
\lqq the false beauties, which a soft and a\break
\lqq flattering hand can give them;\tsk and\break
\lqq that the others, to which he feels no\break
\lqq propensity, appear, at once, naked and\break
\lqq deformed, surrounded with all the\break
\lqq true circumstances of folly and dis-\break
\lqq honour.

\lqq When \i{David} surprized \i{Saul} sleep-\break
\lqq ing in the cave, and cut off the skirt\break
\lqq of his robe,\tsk we read his heart smote\break
\lqq him for what he had done:\tsk But in\break
\lqq the matter of \i{Uriah}, where a faithful\break
\lqq and gallant servant, whom he ought\break
\lqq to have loved and honoured, fell to\break
\lqq make way for his lust,\tsk where con-
\natch{\lqq science}
\lqq science had so much greater reason to\break
\lqq take the alarm, his heart smote him\break
\lqq not.  A whole year had almost passed\break
\lqq from first commission of that crime,\break
\lqq to the time \i{Nathan} was sent to reprove\break
\lqq him; and we read not once of the least\break
\lqq sorrow or compunction of heart which\break
\lqq he testified, during all that time, for\break
\lqq what he had done.

\lqq Thus conscience, this once able mo-\break
\lqq nitor,\tsh placed on high as a judge\break
\lqq within us, and intended by our maker\break
\lqq as a just and equitable one too,\tsk by\break
\lqq an unhappy train of causes and impe-\break
\lqq diments, takes often such imperfect\break
\lqq cognizance of what passes,\tsh does its\break
\lqq office so negligently,\tsh sometimes so\break
\lqq corruptly,\tsk that it is not to be trusted\break
\lqq alone; and therefore we find there is\break
\lqq a necessity, an absolute necessity of
\natch{\lqq joining}
\lqq joining another principle with it to aid,\break
\lqq if not govern, its determinations.

\lqq So that if you would form a just\break
\lqq judgment of what is of infinite impor-\break
\lqq tance to you not to be misled in,\tsh\break
\lqq namely, in what degree of real merit\break
\lqq you stand either as an honest man, an\break
\lqq useful citizen, a faithful subject to your\break
\lqq king, or a good servant to your God,\tsk\break
\lqq call in religion and morality.\tsk Look,\break
\lqq \tsk What is written in the law of God?\break
\lqq \tsh How readest thou?\tsh Consult\break
\lqq calm reason and the unchangeable ob-\break
\lqq ligations of justice and truth;\tsk what\break
\lqq say they?

\lqq Let \lss{\textsc{Conscience}} determine the\break
\lqq matter upon these reports;\tsk and then\break
\lqq if thy heart condemns thee not, which\break
\lqq is the case the Apostle supposes,\tsh the
\natch{\lqq rule}
\lqq rule will be infallible;” [Here Dr.\@ \i{Slop}\break
fell asleep] \lqq \i{thou wilt have confidence to-}\break
\lqq \i{wards God};\tsk that is, have just grounds\break
\lqq to believe the judgment thou hast past\break
\lqq upon thyself, is the judgment of God;\break
\lqq and nothing else but an anticipation\break
\lqq of that righteous sentence which will\break
\lqq be pronounced upon thee hereafter by\break
\lqq that Being, to whom thou art finally\break
\lqq to give an account of thy actions.

\lqq \i{Blessed is the man}, indeed then, as\break
\lqq the author of the book of \i{Ecclesiasticus}\break
\lqq expresses it, \i{who is not prick’d with the}\break
\lqq \i{multitude of his sins: Blessed is the man}\break
\lqq \i{whose heart hath not condemn’d him};\break
\lqq \i{whether he be rich, or whether he be}\break
\lqq \i{poor, if he have a good heart} (a heart\break
\lqq thus guided and informed) \i{he shall at}\break
\lqq \i{all times rejoice in a chearful counte-}\break
\lqq \i{nance; his mind shall tell him more than}
\natch{\lqq \i{seven}

\lqq \i{seven watch-men that sit above upon a}\break

\lqq ginal choice, but of pure necessity,\break
\lqq brought in to fence against the mis-\break
\lqq chievous effects of those consciences\break
\lqq which are no law unto themselves;\break
\lqq well intending, by the many provi-\break
\lqq sions made,\tsh that in all such cor-\break

[I see plainly, said my father, that\break

\stick{but not outwardly\tsk the subject between}
\stick{my uncle \toby and Corporal \trim being}
\stick{rather too serious, considering what had}
\natch{hap-}
\stick{happened, to make a jest of.\tsk So put-}
\stick{ting his pipe into his mouth, which he} 
\stick{had just lighted,\tsk he contented himself}
\stick{with ordering \trim to read on. He read}
on as follows:]

\lqq To have the fear of God before our\break
\lqq eyes, and, in our mutual dealings with\break
\lqq each other, to govern our actions by the\break
\lqq eternal measures of right and wrong:\tsk\break
\lqq The first of these will comprehend the\break
\lqq duties of religion;\tsh the second, those\break
\lqq of morality, which are so inseparably\break
\lqq connected together, that you cannot\break
\lqq divide these two \i{tables}, even in imagi-\break
\lqq nation, (tho’ the attempt is often made\break
\lqq in practice) without breaking and mu-\break
\lqq tually destroying them both.  

\lqq I said the attempt is often made,\break
\lqq and so it is;\tsh there being nothing
\natch{\lqq more}
\lqq more common than to see a man who\break
\lqq has no sense at all of religion,\tsk and in-\break
\lqq deed has so much honesty as to pre-\break
\lqq tend to none, who would take it as the\break
\lqq bitterest affront, should you but hint at\break
\lqq a suspicion of his moral character,\tsh\break
\lqq or imagine he was not conscientiously\break
\lqq just and scrupulous to the uttermost\break
\lqq mite.

\lqq When there is some appearance that\break
\lqq it is so,\tsk tho’ one is unwilling even to\break
\lqq suspect the appearance of so amiable a\break
\lqq virtue as moral honesty, yet were we\break
\lqq to look into the grounds of it, in the\break
\lqq present case, I am persuaded we should\break
\lqq find little reason to envy such a one\break
\lqq the honour of his motive.

\lqq Let him declaim as pompously as\break
\lqq he chooses upon the subject, it will
\natch{\lqq be}
\lqq be found to rest upon no better foun-\break
\lqq dation than either his interest, his pride,\break
\lqq his ease, or some such little and change-\break
\lqq able passion as will give us but small\break
\lqq dependance upon his actions in matters\break
\lqq of great stress.

\lqq I will illustrate this by an ex-\break
\lqq ample.

\lqq I know the banker I deal with, or\break
\lqq the physician I usually call in,” [There\break
is no need, cried \drslop, (waking) to call\break
in any physician in this case] \lqq to be\break
\lqq neither of them men of much religion:\break
\lqq I hear them make a jest of it every\break
\lqq day, and treat all its sanctions with so\break
\lqq much scorn, as to put the matter past\break
\lqq doubt.  Well;\tsk notwithstanding this,\break
\lqq I put my fortune into the hands of the\break
\lqq one;\tsk and what is dearer still to me,
\natch{\lqq I}
\lqq I trust my life to the honest skill of\break
\lqq the other.

\lqq Now let me examine what is my\break
\lqq reason for this great confidence.\tsh\break
\lqq Why, in the first place, I believe there\break
\lqq is no probability that either of them\break
\lqq will employ the power I put into their\break
\lqq hands to my disadvantage;\tsk I con-\break
\lqq sider that honesty serves the purposes\break
\lqq of this life:\tsk I know their success in\break
\lqq the world depends upon the fairness of\break
\lqq their characters.\tsk In a word,\tsk I’m\break
\lqq persuaded that they cannot hurt me,\break
\lqq without hurting themselves more.

\lqq But put it otherwise, namely, that\break
\lqq interest lay, for once, on the other side;\break
\lqq that a case should happen, wherein the\break
\lqq one, without stain to his reputation,\break
\lqq could secrete my fortune, and leave
\natch{\lqq me}
\lqq me naked in the world;\tsk or that the\break
\lqq other could send me out of it, and en-\break
\lqq joy an estate by my death, without\break
\lqq dishonour to himself or his art:\tsk In\break
\lqq this case, what hold have I of either of\break
\lqq them?\tsk Religion, the strongest of all\break
\lqq motives, is out of the question:\tsk In-\break
\lqq terest, the next most powerful motive\break
\lqq in the world, is strongly against me:\tsk\break
\lqq What have I left to cast into the oppo-\break
\lqq site scale to balance this temptation?\tsk\break
\lqq Alas! I have nothing,\tsk nothing but\break
\lqq what is lighter than a bubble\tsk I must\break
\lqq lay at the mercy of \s{Honour}, or some\break
\lqq such capricious principle.\tsk Strait secu-\break
\lqq rity for two of the most valuable bles-\break
\lqq sings!\tsk my property and my life.

\lqq As, therefore, we can have no de-\break
\lqq pendence upon morality without reli-\break
\lqq gion;\tsk so, on the other hand, there is
\natch{\lqq nothing}
\lqq nothing better to be expected from\break
\lqq religion without morality;\tsk neverthe-\break
\lqq less, ’tis no prodigy to see a man whose\break
\lqq real moral character stands very low,\break
\lqq who yet entertains the highest notion\break
\lqq of himself, in the light of a religious\break
\lqq man.

\lqq He shall not only be covetous, re-\break
\lqq vengeful, implacable,\tsk but even\break
\lqq wanting in points of common ho-\break
\lqq nesty; yet inasmuch as he talks aloud\break
\lqq against the infidelity of the age,\tsh\break
\lqq is zealous for some points of reli-\break
\lqq gion,\tsh goes twice a day to church,\break
\lqq \tsh attends the sacraments,\tsh and\break
\lqq amuses himself with a few instrumental\break
\lqq parts of religion,\tsk shall cheat his\break
\lqq conscience into a judgment that, for\break
\lqq this, he is a religious man, and has\break
\lqq discharged truly his duty to God:
\natch{\lqq And}
\lqq And you will find that such a man,\break
\lqq through force of this delusion, gene-\break
\lqq rally looks down with spiritual pride\break
\lqq upon every other man who has less\break
\lqq affectation of piety,\tsk though, perhaps,\break
\lqq ten times more moral honesty than\break
\lqq himself.

\lqq \i{This likewise is a sore evil under the}\break
\lqq \i{sun}; and, I believe there is no one mi-\break
\lqq staken principle, which, for its time,\break
\lqq has wrought more serious mischiefs.\tsh\break
\lqq For a general proof of this,\tsk examine\break
\lqq the history of the \i{Romish} church;”\tsk\break
[Well, what can you make of that, cried\break
Dr.\@ \i{Slop?}]\tsk \lqq see what scenes of cru-\break
\lqq elty, murders, rapines, blood-shed,”\break
[They may thank their own obstinacy,\break
cried Dr.\@ \i{Slop}] \lqq have all been sanctified\break
\lqq by a religion not strictly governed by\break
\lqq morality.\patch{\lqq In}

\tight{\lqq In how many kingdoms of the world,”}\break
[Here \trim kept waving his right-hand from the sermon
to the extent of his arm, returning it backwards and forwards to
the conclusion of the paragraph.]

\lqq In how many kingdoms of the world\break
\lqq has the crusading sword of this mis-\break
\lqq guided saint-errant, spared neither age,\break
\lqq or merit, or sex, or condition?\tsk and,\break
\lqq as he fought under the banners of a\break
\lqq religion which set him loose from ju-\break
\lqq stice and humanity, he shew’d none;\break
\lqq mercilessly trampled upon both,\tsh\break
\lqq heard neither the cries of the unfortu-\break
\lqq nate, nor pitied their distresses.”

[I have been in many a battle, an’

\lqq The surest way to try the merit of\break
\lqq any disputed notion is, to trace down\break
\lqq the consequences such a notion has\break
\lqq produced, and compare them with the\break
\lqq spirit of Christianity;\tsh ’tis the short\break
\lqq and decisive rule which our Saviour\break
\lqq hath left us, for these and such-like\break
\lqq cases, and it is worth a thousand ar-\break
\lqq guments,\tsk \i{By their fruits ye shall know}\break
\lqq \i{them.} 

\lqq I will add no further to the length\break
\lqq of this sermon, than, by two or three
\natch{\lqq short}
\lqq short and independent rules deducible\break
\lqq from it.

\lqq \i{First}, Whenever a man talks loudly\break
\lqq against religion,\tsk always suspect that it\break
\lqq is not his reason, but his passions which\break
\lqq have got the better of his \s{Creed}. A\break
\lqq bad life and a good belief are disagree-\break
\lqq able and troublesome neighbours, and\break
\lqq \tight{where they separate, depend upon it, ’tis}\break
\lqq for no other cause but quietness sake.

\lqq \tight{\i{Secondly}, When a man, thus represen-}\break
\lqq ted, tells you in any particular instance,\break
\lqq \tsk That such a thing goes \i{against} his\break
\lqq conscience,\tsk always believe he means\break
\lqq exactly the same thing, as when he tells\break
\lqq you such a thing goes \i{against} his sto-\break
\lqq mach;\tsk a present want of appetite\break
\lqq being generally the true cause of both.\patch{\lqq In}


\lqq In a word,\tsk trust that man in no-\break
\lqq thing, who has not a \s{Conscience} in\break
\lqq every thing.

\lqq And, in your own case, remember\break
\lqq this plain distinction, a mistake in\break
\lqq which has ruined thousands,\tsk that\break
\lqq your conscience is not a law:\tsk No,\break
\lqq God and reason made the law, and\break
\lqq have placed conscience within you to\break
\lqq determine;\tsh not like an \i{Asiatic} Cadi,\break
\lqq according to the ebbs and flows of his\break
\lqq own passions,\tsk but like a \i{British} judge\break
\lqq in this land of liberty and good sense,\break
\lqq who makes no new law, but faithfully\break
\lqq declares that law which he knows al-\break
\lqq ready written.”

\noindent\patch{Thou}

Thou hast read the sermon extremely 
\stick{well, \trim, quoth my father.\tsk If he had}
\stick{spared his comments, replied \drslop,}
\stick{he would have read it much better.  I} 
\stick{should have read it ten times better, Sir,} 
\stick{answered \trim, but that my heart was so}
\stick{full.\tsk That was the very reason, \trim,}
\stick{replied my father, which has made thee}  
\stck{read the sermon as well as thou hast done;}
\stick{and if the clergy of our church, continued}
\stick{my father, addressing himself to \drslop,}
\stick{would take part in what they deliver, as}
\stick{deeply as this poor fellow has done,\tsk as}
\stick{their compositions are fine; (I deny it,}
\stick{quoth \drslop) I maintain it, that the} 
\stick{eloquence of our pulpits, with such sub-}
\stick{jects to inflame it,\tsk would be a model}
\stick{for the whole world:\tsk But, alas! con-}
\stick{tinued my father, and I own it, Sir, with} 
\stick{sorrow, that, like \i{French} politicians in this}
\stick{respect, what they gain in the cabinet}
\natch{they}
\stick{they lose in the field.\tsh ’Twere a pity,}
\stick{quoth my uncle, that this should be lost.} 
\stick{I like the sermon well, replied my fa-}
\stick{ther,\tsh ’tis dramatic,\tsk and there is}
\stick{something in that way of writing, when} 
\stick{skilfully managed, which catches the at-}
\stick{tention.\tsh We preach much in that}
\stick{way with us, said Dr.\@ \i{Slop.}\tsk I know that}
\stick{very well, said my father,\tsk but in a tone} 
\stick{and manner which disgusted \drslop,}
\stick{full as much as his assent, simply, could}
\stick{have pleased him.\tsh But in this, added} 
\stick{\drslop, a little piqued,\tsk our sermons} 
\stick{have greatly the advantage, that we ne-}
\stick{ver introduce any character into them}
\stick{below a patriarch or a patriarch’s wife,} 
\stick{or a martyr or a saint.\tsk There are some} 
\stick{very bad characters in this, however, said}
\stick{my father, and I do not think the sermon}
\stick{a jot the worse for ’em.\tsh But pray,} 
\stick{quoth my uncle \toby,\tsk who’s can this}
\natch{be?}
\stick{be?\tsk How could it get into my \i{Stevi}-}
\stick{\i{nus}? A man must be as great a conjurer}
\stick{as \i{Stevinus}, said my father, to resolve} 
\stick{the second question:\tsk The first, I think,}
\stick{is not so difficult;\tsh for unless my judg-}
\stick{ment greatly deceives me,\tsh I know the} 
\stick{author, for ’tis wrote, certainly, by the} 
parson of the parish.

The similitude of the stile and man-\break
ner of it, with those my father con-\break
stantly had heard preach’d in his pa-\break
rish-church, was the ground of his con-\break
jecture,\tsh proving it as strongly, as\break
an argument \i{à priori}, could prove such\break
a thing to a philosophic mind, That\break
it was \i{Yorick}’s and no one’s else:\tsh\break 
It was proved to be so \i{à posteriori},\break
the day after, when \i{Yorick} sent a ser-\break
vant to my uncle \toby's house to enquire\break
after it.\patch{It}

It seems that \i{Yorick}, who was inqui-
\stick{sitive after all kinds of knowledge, had} 
\stick{borrowed \i{Stevinus} of my uncle \toby, and} 
\stick{had carelesly popp’d his sermon, as soon} 
\stick{as he had made it, into the middle of}
\stick{\i{Stevinus}; and by an act of forgetfulness,}
\stick{to which he was ever subject, he had}
\stick{sent \i{Stevinus} home, and his sermon to}
keep him company.

Ill-fated sermon! Thou wast lost, after
\stick{this recovery of thee, a second time,} 
\stick{dropped thro’ an unsuspected fissure in} 
\stick{thy master’s pocket, down into a trea-}
\stick{cherous and a tatter’d lining,\tsk trod deep}
\stick{into the dirt by the left hind foot of his}
\stick{\stck{Rosinante, inhumanly stepping upon thee}} 
\stick{as thou falledst;\tsk buried ten days in the}
\stick{mire,\tsh raised up out of it by a beggar,}
\stick{sold for a halfpenny to a parish-clerk,\tsk}
\stick{transferred to his parson,\tsh lost for ever}
\natch{to}
\stick{to thy own, the remainder of his days,\tsk}
\stick{nor restored to his restless \s{Manes} till}
\stick{this very moment, that I tell the world}
the story.

Can the reader believe, that this sermon of
\i{Yorick}’s was preach’d at an assize, in the cathedral
of \i{York}, before a thousand witnesses, ready to give oath of
it, by a certain prebendary of that church, and actually printed by
him when he had done,\tsh and within so short a space as
two years and three months after \i{Yorick}’s
death.\tsk \i{Yorick}, indeed, was never better served in his
life!\tsh but it was a little hard to male-treat him after,
and plun-\break der him after he was laid in his grave.

However, as the gentleman who did it, was in perfect charity with
\i{Yorick},\tsk\break
and, in conscious justice, printed but a
\natch{few}
\stick{few copies to give away;\tsk and that, I am}
\stick{told, he could moreover have made as}
\stick{good a one himself, had he thought fit,}
\stick{\tsk I declare I would not have published} 
\stick{this anecdote to the world;\tsk nor do I} 
\stick{publish it with an intent to hurt his cha-}
\stick{racter and advancement in the church;\tsk}
\stick{I leave that to others;\tsh but I find my-}
\stick{self impelled by two reasons, which I} 
cannot withstand.

The first is, That, in doing justice, I
\stick{may give rest to \i{Yorick}’s ghost;\tsk which,}
\stick{as the country people,\tsk and some others,}
believe,\tsh \i{still walks}.

The second reason is, That, by laying
\stick{open this story to the world, I gain an} 
\stick{opportunity of informing it,\tsk That in} 
\stick{case the character of parson \i{Yorick}, and} 
\stick{this sample of his sermons is liked,\tsk that}
\natch{there}
\stick{there are now in the possession of the}
\stick{\i{Shandy} family, as many as will make} 
\stick{a handsome volume, at the world’s ser-}
\stick{vice,\tsh and much good may they}
do it.

\stick{as that,\tsh unless the lean old mother}

They are in the right of it,\tsk quoth
\stick{my uncle \toby. But, Sir, replied Dr.}
\stick{\i{Slop}, not taking notice of my uncle \toby's}
\stick{opinion, but turning to my father,\tsk they}
\stick{had better govern in other points;\tsh and}
\stick{a father of a family, who wished its per-}
\stick{petuity, in my opinion, had better ex-}
\stick{change this prerogative with them, and} 
\stick{give up some other rights in lieu of it.\tsh}
\stick{I know not, quoth my father, answering}
\stick{a little too testily, to be quite dispassion-}
\stick{ate in what he said,\tsk I know not, quoth}
\stick{he, what we have left to give up, in lieu}
\stick{of who shall bring our children into the}

\section{\chapstrut\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  XIX.}

\initial{I}{Have} dropp’d the curtain over this\break
scene for a minute,\tsk to remind you of one
thing,\tsk and to inform you of an\-other.

What I have to inform you, comes, I own, a little out of its due
course;\tsh for it should have been told a hundred and
\natch{fifty}
fifty pages ago, but that I foresaw then ’twould come in pat hereafter, and be of
more advantage here than elsewhere.\tsh\break
Writers had need look before them, to keep up the spirit and
connection of what they have in hand.

When these two things are done,\tsk the 
\stick{curtain shall be drawn up again, and my}
\stick{uncle \toby, my father, and \drslop, shall} 
\stick{go on with their discourse, without any} 
more interruption.

First, then, the matter which I have 
\stick{to remind you of, is this;\tsh that from} 
\stck{the specimens of singularity in my father’s} 
\stick{notions in the point of Christian-names,} 
\stick{and that other previous point thereto,\tsk}
\stick{you was led, I think, into an opinion,}
\stick{(and I am sure I said as much) that my}
\stick{father was a gentleman altogether as odd}
\natch{and}
\stick{and whimsical in fifty other opinions. In} 
\stick{truth, there was not a stage in the life of}
\stick{man, from the very first act of his be-}
\stick{getting,\tsh down to the lean and slipper’d} 
\stick{pantaloon in his second childishness, but} 
\stick{he had some favourite notion to himself,} 
\stick{springing out of it, as sceptical, and as} 
\stick{far out of the high-way of thinking, as} 
these two which have been explained.

\tsk Mr.\@ \i{Shandy}, my father, Sir, would 
\stick{see nothing in the light in which others}
\stick{placed it;\tsk he placed things in his own} 
\stick{light;\tsk he would weigh nothing in com-}
\stick{mon scales;\tsk no,\tsk he was too refined a}
\stick{researcher to lay open to so gross an im-}
\stick{position.\tsk To come at the exact weight} 
\stick{of things in the scientific steel-yard, the} 
\stick{fulcrum, he would say, should be almost}
\stick{invisible, to avoid all friction from po-}
\stick{pular tenets;\tsk without this the minutiæ}
\natch{of}
\stick{of philosophy, which would always turn} 
\stick{the balance, will have no weight at all.\tsk}
\stick{Knowledge, like matter, he would affirm,}
\stck{was divisible \i{in infinitum};\tsk that the grains}
\stick{and scruples were as much a part of it, as} 
\stick{the gravitation of the whole world.\tsk In}
\stick{a word, he would say, error was error,\tsk}
\stick{no matter where it fell,\tsk whether in a} 
\stick{fraction,\tsk or a pound,\tsk ’twas alike fatal} 
\stick{to truth, and she was kept down at the}
\stick{bottom of her well as inevitably by a} 
\stick{mistake in the dust of a butterfly’s wing,}
\stick{\tsk as in the disk of the sun, the moon, and} 
all the stars of heaven put together.

He would often lament that it was for
\stick{want of considering this properly, and of}
applying it skilfully to civil matters, as \stck{well
as to speculative truths, that so many} things in this world were
out of joint;\tsk\break
that the political arch was giving way;\tsk
\natch{and}
and that the very foundations of our excellent constitution in
church and state, \tight{were so sapp’d as estimators had reported.}

You cry out, he would say, we are a
\stck{ruined, undone people.\tsk Why? he would} 
\stck{ask, making use of the sorites or syllogism} 
\stick{of \i{Zeno} and \i{Chrysippus}, without knowing}
\stick{it belonged to them.\tsk Why? why are we}
\stck{a ruined people?\tsk Because we are corrup-}
\stick{ted.\tsk Whence is it, dear Sir, that we are}
\stck{corrupted?\tsk Because we are needy;\tsk our}
\stick{poverty, and not our wills, consent.\tsk}
\stick{And wherefore, he would add,\tsk are we}
\stick{needy?\tsk From the neglect, he would an-}
\stick{swer, of our pence and our halfpence:\tsk}
\stick{Our bank-notes, Sir, our guineas,\tsk nay}
our shillings, take care of themselves.

’Tis the same, he would say, through-\break
\stick{out the whole circle of the sciences;\tsk}
\natch{the}
\stick{the great, the established points of them,} 
\stick{are not to be broke in upon.\tsk The laws} 
\stick{of nature will defend themselves;\tsk but}
\stick{error\tsk (he would add, looking earnestly}
\stick{at my mother)\tsk error, Sir, creeps in thro’}
\stk{the minute holes, and small crevices, which}
human nature leaves unguarded.

This turn of thinking in my father, is 
\stick{what I had to remind you of:\tsk The point}
\stick{you are to be informed of, and which I}
have reserved for this place, is as follows:

Amongst the many and excellent rea-
\stick{sons, with which my father had urged}
\stick{my mother to accept of Dr.\@ \i{Slop}’s as-}
\stick{sistance preferably to that of the old wo-}
\stick{man,\tsk there was one of a very singular} 
\stick{nature; which, when he had done ar-}
\stick{guing the matter with her as a Christian,}
\stick{and came to argue it over again with her}
\natch{as}
\stick{as a philosopher, he had put his whole}
\stick{strength to, depending indeed upon it as} 
\stick{his sheet-anchor.\tsh It failed him, tho’} 
\stick{from no defect in the argument itself;} 
\stick{but that, do what he could, he was not} 
\stick{able for his soul to make her comprehend}
\stick{the drift of it.\tsk Cursed luck!\tsk said he}
\stick{to himself, one afternoon, as he walk’d}
\stick{out of the room, after he had been sta-}
\stick{ting it for an hour and a half to her, to}
\stick{no manner of purpose;\tsk cursed luck!} 
\stick{said he, biting his lip as he shut the door,}
\stick{\tsk for a man to be master of one of the}
\stick{finest chains of reasoning in nature,\tsh}
\stick{and have a wife at the same time with}
\stick{such a head-piece, that he cannot hang} 
\stick{up a single inference within side of it, to} 
save his soul from destruction.

This argument, tho’ it was intirely lost
\stick{upon my mother,\tsk had more weight with}
\natch{him,}
\stick{him, than all his other arguments joined} 
\stick{together:\tsk I will therefore endeavour to}
\stick{do it justice,\tsk and set it forth with all the}
perspicuity I am master of.

My father set out upon the strength of\break
these two following axioms:

\i{First}, \tight{That an ounce of a man’s own wit,}\break
was worth a tun of other peoples; and,

\i{Secondly}, (Which, by the bye, was the
\stick{ground-work of the first axiom,\tsk tho’ it}
\stick{comes last) That every man’s wit must} 
\stick{come from every man’s own soul,\tsk and} 
no other body’s.

Now, as it was plain to my father, that
\stick{all souls were by nature equal,\tsk and that}
\stick{the great difference between the most}
\stck{acute and the most obtuse understanding,}
\natch{\tsk was}
\stick{\tsh was from no original sharpness or}
\stck{bluntness of one thinking substance above}
\stick{or below another,\tsk but arose merely from} 
\stick{the lucky or unlucky organization of the}
\stick{body, in that part where the soul princi-}
\stick{pally took up her residence,\tsh he had}
\stick{made it the subject of his enquiry to find}
out the identical place.

Now, from the best accounts he had 
\stick{been able to get of this matter, he was} 
\stick{satisfied it could not be where \i{Des Cartes}} 
\stick{had fixed it, upon the top of the \i{pineal}}
\stick{gland of the brain; which, as he philo-}
\stick{sophised, formed a cushion for her about} 
\stick{the size of a marrow pea; tho’ to speak} 
\stck{the truth, as so many nerves did terminate} 
\stick{all in that one place,\tsk ’twas no bad con-}
\stick{jecture;\tsk and my father had certainly}
\stick{fallen with that great philosopher plumb} 
\stick{into the center of the mistake, had it not}
\natch{been}
\stick{been for my uncle \toby, who rescued} 
\stick{him out of it, by a story he told him of} 
\stick{a \i{Walloon} officer at the battle of \i{Landen},} 
\stick{who had one part of his brain shot away} 
\stick{by a musket-ball,\tsk and another part of}
\stick{it taken out after by a \i{French} surgeon;} 
\stick{and, after all, recovered, and did his duty}
very well without it.

\tight{If death, said my father, reasoning with}\break
\stick{himself, is nothing but the separation of} 
\stick{the soul from the body;\tsk and if it is true}
\stick{that people can walk about and do their} 
\stick{business without brains,\tsk then certes the} 
soul does not inhabit there. \quad Q.\,E.\,D.

As for that certain, very thin, subtle, 
\stk{and very fragrant juice which \i{Coglionissimo}}
\stick{\i{Borri}, the great \i{Milaneze} physician, af-}
\stck{firms, in a letter to \i{Bartholine}, to have dis-}
\stck{covered in the cellulæ of the occipital parts}
\natch{of}
of the cerebellum, and which he likewise
\stick{affirms to be the principal seat of the rea-}
\stck{sonable soul, (for, you must know, in these}
\stick{latter and more enlightened ages, there}
\stick{are two souls in every man living,\tsk the}
one, according to the great \i{Metheglingius},
being called the \i{Animus}, the other, the
\i{Anima});\tsk as for the opinion, I say, of
\i{Borri},\tsk my father could never subscribe to it by any
means; the very idea of so 
\stck{noble, so refined, so immaterial, and so ex-}
\stick{\tight{alted a being as the \i{Anima}, or even the \i{Ani-}}}
\stick{\i{mus}, taking up her residence, and sitting}
\stck{dabbling, like a tad-pole all day long, both}
\stick{summer and winter, in a puddle,\tsk or in a}
\stick{\tighter{liquid of any kind, how thick or thin soever,}}
\stick{\tight{he would say, shock’d his imagination; he}}
\tight{would scarce give the doctrine a hearing.}

\noindent
\stick{\hfill \tight{What, therefore, seem’d the least liable}}
to objections of any, was, that the chief
\natch{sen-}
sensorium, or
head-quarters of the soul, and to which place all intelligences
were referred, and from whence all her mandates were issued,\tsk
was in, or near, the\break
\stck{cerebellum,\tsk or rather some-where about}
the \i{medulla oblongata}, wherein it was ge\-nerally agreed
by \i{Dutch} anatomists, that
\stick{all the minute nerves from all the organs}
\stick{\tighter{of the seven senses concentered, like streets}} and
winding alleys, into a square.

So far there was nothing singular in my father’s
opinion,\tsk he had the best of philosophers, of all ages and
climates, to go along with him.\tsk But here he took a\break
road of his own, setting up another \i{Shan\-dean} \tight{hypothesis upon
these corner-stones} they had laid for him;\tsk and which
said 
\stck{hypothesis equally stood its ground; whe-}
ther the subtilty and
fineness of the soul \tight{depended upon the temperature and
clear-}
\natch{ness}
ness of
the said liquor, or of the finer net-work and texture in the
cerebellum itself; which opinion he favoured.

He maintained, that next to the due care to be taken in the act
of propagation of each individual, which required all the thought
in the world, as it laid the foundation of this incomprehensible
contexture in which wit, memory, fancy, eloquence, and what is
usually meant by the name of good natural parts, do
consist;\tsk that next to this and his Christian-name, which were
the two original and
\stick{most efficacious causes of all;\tsk that the} 
third cause, or rather what logicians
call 
\tight{the \i{Causa sine quâ non}, and without which}
all that was done was of no manner of 
\stick{\tight{significance,\tsk was the preservation of this}}
delicate and fine-spun web, from the ha\-vock
which was generally made in it by
\natch{the}
the violent compression and crush
which the head was made to undergo, by the nonsensical method of
bringing us into the world by that part foremost.

\tsh This requires explanation.

My father, who dipp’d into all kinds of books, upon looking into \i{Lithopædus
Senonesis de Partu difficili} \fnast, published by\break
\rightline{\i{Adri-}}

\bgroup\fontsize{8}{11}\selectfont\indent\fnast\ 
The author is here twice mistaken;\tsh for\break
\i{Lithopædus} should be wrote thus, \i{Lithopædii Seno}-\break
\i{nensis Icon}. The second mistake is, that this \i{Li}-\break
\i{thopædus} is not an author, but a drawing of a\break
petrified child. The account of this, published\break
by \i{Albosius}, 1580, may be seen at the end of\break
\i{Cordæus}’s works in \i{Spachius}. Mr.\,\i{Tristram Shandy}\break
has been led into this error, either from seeing\break
\i{Lithopædus}’s name of late in a catalogue of lear-\break
ned writers in \hbox{Dr. \tsh}, or by mistaking \i{Li}-\break
\i{thopædus} for \i{Trinecavellius},\tsk from the too great\break
similitude of the names.\par\egroup

\newpage\noindent
\i{Adrianus Smelvgot}, had found out, That\break
the lax and pliable state of a child’s\break
head in parturition, the bones of the\break
cranium having no sutures at that time,\break
was such,\tsk that by force of the woman’s\break
efforts, which, in strong labour-pains,\break
was equal, upon an average, to a
weight of 470 pounds averdupoise acting perpendicularly upon it;\tsk it so happened,
that, in 49 instances out of 50, the said head was compressed and moulded into the
shape of an oblong conical piece of dough, such as a pastry-cook generally rolls up
in order to make a pye of.\tsh\break
Good God!  cried my father, what ha\-vock and destruction
must this make in the infinitely fine and tender texture of the cerebellum!\tsk Or if
there is such a juice as \i{Borri} pretends,\tsk is it not enough to make the
clearest liquid in the world both feculent and
mothery?\patch{But}

But how great was his apprehension, 
\stick{when he further understood, that this} 
\stick{force, acting upon the very vertex of}
\stick{the head, not only injured the brain itself} 
\stick{or cerebrum,\tsk but that it necessarily} 
\stick{squeez’d and propell’d the cerebrum to-}
\stick{wards the cerebellum, which was the im-}
\stick{mediate seat of the understanding.\tsh}
\stick{Angels and Ministers of grace defend us!} 
\stick{cried my father,\tsk can any soul withstand} 
\stick{this shock?\tsk No wonder the intellectual}
\stick{web is so rent and tatter’d as we see it;} 
\stick{and that so many of our best heads are no} 
\stick{better than a puzzled skein of silk,\tsk all}
perplexity,\tsk all confusion within side.

But when my father read on, and was let into the secret, that
when a child was turn’d topsy-turvy, which was easy for an operator
to do, and was extracted by the feet;\tsk that instead of the
cerebrum
\natch{being}
\stick{being propell’d towards the cerebellum,}
\stick{the cerebellum, on the contrary, was pro-}
\stck{pell’d simply towards the cerebrum where}
\stick{it could do no manner of hurt:\tsh By}
\stick{heavens! cried he, the world is in con-}
\stick{spiracy to drive out what little wit God} 
\stick{has given us,\tsk and the professors of the} 
\stick{obstetric art are listed into the same con-}
\stick{spiracy.\tsk What is it to me which end of}
\stick{my son comes foremost into the world,} 
\stick{provided all goes right after, and his ce-}
rebellum escapes uncrushed?

It is the nature of an hypothesis, when
\stick{once a man has conceived it, that it assi-}
\stick{milates every thing to itself as proper}
\stick{nourishment; and, from the first moment} 
\stick{of your begetting it, it generally grows} 
\stick{the stronger by every thing you see, hear,} 
\stick{read, or understand. This is of great}
use.\patch{When}

When my father was gone with this 
\stick{about a month, there was scarce a phæ-}
\stick{nomenon of stupidity or of genius, which}
\stick{he could not readily solve by it;\tsk it ac-}
\stck{counted for the eldest son being the great-}
\stick{est blockhead in the family.\tsk Poor devil,}
\stck{he would say,\tsk he made way for the capa-}
\stck{city of his younger brothers.\tsk It unriddled}
\stk{the observation of drivellers and monstrous} 
\stick{heads,\tsk shewing \i{à priori}, it could not be}
\stck{otherwise,\tsk unless\enspace\wastiv\ I don’t know} 
\stick{what. It wonderfully explain’d and ac-}
\stick{counted for the acumen of the \i{Asiatic} ge-}
\stick{nius, and that sprightlier turn, and a} 
\stick{more penetrating intuition of minds, in} 
\stick{warmer climates; not from the loose and}
\stick{common-place solution of a clearer sky,} 
\stick{and a more perpetual sun-shine, \etc\tsk}
\stick{which, for aught he knew, might as well} 
\stick{rarify and dilute the faculties of the soul}
\stick{into nothing, by one extreme,\tsk as they}
\natch{are}
are condensed in colder climates by the other;\tsh but he traced the affair up to
its spring-head;\tsk shew’d that, in warmer climates, nature had laid a lighter tax
upon the fairest parts of the creation;\tsk\break
their pleasures more;\tsk the necessity of their pains less, insomuch that the
pressure and resistance upon the vertex was so slight, that the whole organization
of the cerebellum was preserved;\tsh nay, he did not believe, in natural births,
that so much as a single thread of the net-work was broke or displaced,\tsk so that
the soul\break might just act as she liked.

When my father had got so far,\tsk
\stick{what a blaze of light did the accounts of}
\stick{the \i{Caesarian} section, and of the towering} 
\stick{geniuses who had come safe into the} 
\stick{world by it, cast upon this hypothesis?} 
\stick{Here you see, he would say, there was no}
\stick{injury done to the sensorium;\tsk no pres-}
\natch{sure}
sure of the head against the
pelvis;\tsk no\break
propulsion of the cerebrum towards the
cerebellum, either by the \i{os pubis} on this side, or the \i{os
coxcygis} on that;\tsk and,\break
\tight{pray, what were the happy consequences?}\break 
Why, Sir, your \i{Julius Caesar}, who gave the
operation a name;\tsk and your \i{Hermes Trismegistus}, who
was born so before ever the operation had a name;\tsk your
\stick{\i{Scipio Africanus}; your \i{Manlius Torquatus};}
\stick{our \i{Edward} the Sixth,\tsk who, had he lived,}
\stick{would have done the same honour to the}
\stck{hypothesis:\tsk These, and many more, who} 
\stick{figur’d high in the annals of fame,\tsk all}
came \i{side-way}, Sir, into the world.

The incision of the \i{abdomen} and \i{ute}-
\stick{\i{rus}, ran for six weeks together in my fa-}
\stick{ther’s head;\tsk he had read, and was satis-}
\stick{fied, that wounds in the \i{epigastrium}, and} 
\stick{those in the \i{matrix}, were not mortal;\tsk}
\stick{so that the belly of the mother might be}
\natch{opened}
\stick{opened extremely well to give a passage}
\stick{to the child.\tsk He mentioned the thing}
\stick{one afternoon to my mother,\tsk merely as}
\stick{a matter of fact;\tsk but seeing her turn as}
\stick{pale as ashes at the very mention of it,}
\stick{as much as the operation flattered his}
\stick{hopes,\tsk he thought it as well to say no} 
\stick{more of it,\tsk contenting himself with ad-}
\stick{miring,\tsk what he thought was to no pur-}
pose to propose.

\tight{This was my father Mr.\@ \i{Shandy}’s hypo-}
\stick{thesis; concerning which I have only to}
\stick{add, that my brother \i{Bobby} did as great}
\stick{honour to it (whatever he did to the fa-}
\stick{mily) as any one of the great heroes we}
\stick{spoke of:\tsk For happening not only to be}
\stick{christen’d, as I told you, but to be born} 
\stick{too, when my father was at \i{Epsom},\tsk}
\stick{being moreover my mother’s \i{first} child,}
\stick{\tsk coming into the world with his head}
\stick{\i{foremost},\tsk and turning out afterwards a}
\natch{lad}
\stick{lad of wonderful slow parts,\tsh my father}
\stick{spelt all these together into his opinion;}
\stick{and as he had failed at one end,\tsk he was}
determined to try the other.

This was not to be expected from one
\stick{of the sisterhood, who are not easily to be}
\stick{put out of their way,\tsh and was therefore}
\stick{one of my father’s great reasons in favour}
\stick{of a man of science, whom he could bet-}
ter deal with.

Of all men in the world, \drslop was
\stick{the fittest for my father’s purpose;\tsh for}
\stick{though his new invented forceps was} 
\stick{the armour he had proved, and what he} 
\stick{maintained, to be the safest instrument of}
\stick{deliverance,\tsk yet, it seems, he had scat-}
\stick{tered a word or two in his book, in fa-}
\stick{vour of the very thing which ran in my}
\stick{father’s fancy;\tsh tho’ not with a view to}
\stick{the soul’s good in extracting by the feet,}
\natch{as}
\stick{as was my father’s system,\tsk but for rea-}
sons merely obstetrical.

This will account for the coalition be-
\stick{twixt my father and \drslop, in the en-}
\stick{suing discourse, which went a little hard} 
\stick{against my uncle \toby.\tsk In what manner} 
\stick{a plain man, with nothing but common} 
\stick{sense, could bear up against two such} 
\stick{allies in science,\tsk is hard to conceive.\tsk}
\stick{You may conjecture upon it, if you please,}
\stick{\tsk and whilst your imagination is in mo-}
\stick{tion, you may encourage it to go on, and} 
\stick{discover by what causes and effects in} 
\stick{nature it could come to pass, that my} 
\stick{uncle \toby got his modesty by the wound} 
\stick{he received upon his groin.\tsk You may} 
\stick{raise a system to account for the loss of}
\stick{my nose by marriage articles,\tsk and shew}
\stick{the world how it could happen, that I} 
\stick{should have the misfortune to be called}
\stick{\s{Tristram}, in opposition to my father’s}
\natch{hy-}
\stick{hypothesis, and the wish of the whole} 
\stick{family, God-fathers and God-mothers}
\stick{not excepted.\tsk These, with fifty other}
\stick{points left yet unraveled, you may en-}
\stick{deavour to solve if you have time;\tsh but} 
\stick{I tell you before-hand it will be in vain,}
\stick{\tsk for not the sage \i{Alquise}, the magician}
\stick{in Don \i{Belianis} of \i{Greece}, nor the no less} 
\stick{famous \i{Urganda}, the sorceress his wife,}
\stick{(were they alive) could pretend to come} 
within a league of the truth.

The reader will be content to wait for
\stick{a full explanation of these matters till}
\stick{the next year,\tsk when a series of things}
will be laid open which he little expects.
