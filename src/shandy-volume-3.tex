\stick{nothing is more dangerous, madam, than}

This will be fully illustrated to the\break

\stick{upon the arm of his chair\tsk my father}
\stick{thought there was no time to be lost with}
\stick{my uncle \toby, so took up the discourse}
as follows.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  II.}

\dropcap{\lower-10pt\hbox{\large “}%

\tight{Brother \toby, replied my father, taking}\break
\stick{his wig from off his head with his right}
\stick{hand, and with his \i{left} pulling out a}
\stick{striped \i{India} handkerchief from his right}
\stick{coat pocket, in order to rub his head,}
\natch{as}
\stick{as he argued the point with my uncle}
\i{Toby.}\tsh

\tsh Now, in this I think my father\break
\stick{was much to blame; and I will give you}
my reasons for it.

Matters of no more seeming conse-\break
\stick{quence in themselves than, \lqq\i{Whether}}
\stick{\i{my father should have taken off his wig}}
\stick{\i{with his right hand or with his left},\kern0pt”\tsk}
\stick{have divided the greatest kingdoms, and}
\stick{made the crowns of the monarchs who}
\stick{governed them, to totter upon their}
\stick{heads.\tsk But need I tell you, Sir, that the}
\stick{circumstances with which every thing in}
\stick{this world is begirt, give every thing in}
\stick{this world its size and shape;\tsh and by}
\stick{tightening it, or relaxing it, this way or}
\stick{that, make the thing to be, what it is\tsk}
\stick{great\tsk little\tsk good\tsk bad\tsk indifferent}
\natch{or}
\stick{or not indifferent, just as the case hap-}
pens.

As my father’s \i{India} handkerchief was\break
\stick{in his right coat pocket, he should by no}
\stick{means have suffered his right hand to}
\stick{have got engaged: on the contrary, in-}
\stick{stead of taking off his wig with it, as he}
\stick{did, he ought to have committed that}
\stick{entirely to the left; and then, when the}
\stick{natural exigency my father was under of}
\stick{rubbing his head, call’d out for his hand-}
\stick{kerchief, he would have had nothing in}
\stick{the world to have done, but to have put}
\stick{his right hand into his right coat pocket}
\stick{and taken it out;\tsk which he might have}
\stick{done without any violence, or the least}
\stick{ungraceful twist in any one tendon or}
muscle of his whole body.

In this case, (unless indeed, my father\break
\natch{had}
\stick{had been resolved to make a fool of him-}
\stick{self by holding the wig stiff in his left} 
\stick{hand\tsk or by making some nonsensical} 
\stick{angle or other at his elbow joint, or arm-}
\stick{pit)\tsk his whole attitude had been easy\tsk}
\stick{natural\tsk unforced: \i{Reynolds} himself, as} 
\stick{great and gracefully as he paints, might}
have painted him as he sat.

Now, as my father managed this mat-\break
\stick{ter,\tsk consider what a devil of a figure}
my father made of himself.

\tsk In the latter end of Queen \i{Anne}’s\break
\stick{reign, and in the beginning of the reign} 
\stick{of King \i{George} the first\tsk \lqq\i{Coat pockets}}
\stick{\i{were cut very low down in the skirt}.\kern0pt”\tsh} 
\stick{I need say no more\tsh the father of mis-}
\stick{chief, had he been hammering at it a}
\stick{month, could not have contrived a worse} 
fashion for one in my father’s situation.

was not an easy matter in any king’s\break
reign, (unless you were as lean a sub-\break
\stick{ject as myself) to have forced your hand}
\stick{diagonally, quite across your whole body,}
\stick{so as to gain the bottom of your opposite}
\stick{coat-pocket.\tsh In the year, one thousand}
\stick{seven hundred and eighteen, when this}
\stick{happened, it was extremely difficult; so}
\stick{that when my uncle \toby discovered the}
\stick{transverse zig-zaggery of my father’s ap-}
\stick{proaches towards it, it instantly brought}
\stick{into his mind those he had done duty in,}
\stick{before the gate of St.\@ \i{Nicolas};\tsk the}
\stick{idea of which drew off his attention so}
\stick{entirely from the subject in debate, that}
\stick{he had got his right hand to the bell to}
\stick{ring up \i{Trim}, to go and fetch his map of}
\stick{\i{Namur}, and his compasses and sector}
\natch{along}
\stick{along with it, to measure the returning}
\stick{angles of the traverses of that attack,\tsk}
\stick{but particularly of that one, where he re-}
ceived his wound upon his groin.

\natch{when}
\stick{when you are so fortunate a fellow, as to}
\stick{have had your jerkin made of a gum-}
\stick{taffeta, and the body-lining to it, of a}

\stck{all pretended that their jerkins were made}
\stick{after this fashion,\tsh you might have}

\stick{with them, and at the same time, not}

done to them.

I believe in my conscience that mine\break

\stick{for me:\tsk had there been the least gum-}
\stick{miness in my lining,\tsk by heaven! it}
\stick{had all of it long ago been fray’d and}
fretted to a thread.

\stick{head till he could just see the cornish of}
\stick{the room, and then directing the buccina-}
\stick{tory muscles along his cheeks, and the}
\natch{orbi-}
\stick{orbicular muscles around his lips to do}
their duty\tsk he whistled \i{Lillabullero}.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  VII.}

\dropcap[findent=2pt]{W}{hilst} \tight{my uncle \toby was whist-}\break
ling \i{Lillabullero} to my father,\tsk\break

\stick{rate;\tsh it would have done your heart}
\stick{good, and cured you, Sir, for ever, of} 
\stick{the vile sin of swearing to have heard}
\stick{him.\tsk I am determined therefore to re-}
late the whole affair to you.

When \drslop's maid delivered the\break
\stick{green bays bag, with her master’s instru-}
\stick{ments in it, to \i{Obadiah}, she very sensibly}
\stick{exhorted him to put his head and one}
\stick{arm through the strings, and ride with it}
\stick{slung across his body: so undoing the}
\natch{bow-}
\stick{bow-knot, to lengthen the strings for}
\stick{him, without any more ado, she helped}
\stick{him on with it. However, as this, in}
\stick{some measure, unguarded the mouth of}
\stick{the bag, lest any thing should bolt out in}
\stick{galloping back at the speed \i{Obadiah}}
\stick{threatened, they consulted to take it off}
\stick{again; and in the great care and caution}
\stick{of their hearts, they had taken the two}
\stick{strings and tied them close (pursing up}
\stick{the mouth of the bag first) with half a}
\stick{dozen hard knots, each of which, \i{Oba-}}
\stick{\i{diah}, to make all safe, had twitched and}
\stick{drawn together with all the strength of}
his body.

\tight{This answered all that \i{Obadiah} and the}\break
\stick{maid intended; but was no remedy}
\stick{against some evils which neither he or}
\stick{she foresaw.  The instruments, it seems,}
\stick{as tight as the bag was tied above, had}
\natch{so}
\stick{so much room to play in it, towards the}
\stick{bottom, (the shape of the bag being}
\stck{conical) that \i{Obadiah} could not make a trot}
\stick{of it, but with such a terrible jingle, what}
\stck{with the \i{tire-tête}, \i{forceps} and \i{squirt}, as}
\stck{would have been enough, had \i{Hymen} been}
\stick{taking a jaunt that way, to have fright-}
\stick{ened him out of the country; but when}
\stick{\i{Obadiah} accelerated this motion, and}
\stick{from a plain trot assayed to prick his}
\stick{coach-horse into a full gallop\tsk by hea-}
ven! Sir,\tsk the jingle was incredible.

As \i{Obadiah} had a wife and three chil-\break
\stick{dren.\tsk The turpitude of fornication, and}
\stick{the many other political ill consequences}
\stick{of this jingling, never once entered his}
\stick{brain,\tsk he had however his objection,}
\stick{which came home to himself, and weigh-}
\stick{ed with him, as it has oft-times done with}
\natch{the}
\stick{the greatest patriots.\tsk “\i{The poor fel}-}
\tight{\i{low, Sir, was not able to hear himself whistle}.”}

\stick{\i{mond Shandy},\tsk a little man,\tsk but of}
\stick{high fancy:\tsk he rushed into the duke}
\stick{of \i{Monmouth}’s affair:\tsh nor, secondly,}
\stick{in this place, do I mean that particular}
\stick{species of knots, called bow-knots;\tsk}
\stick{there is so little address, or skill, or pa-}
\stick{tience, required in the unloosing them,}
\stick{that they are below my giving any}
\stick{opinion at all about them.\tsk But by the}
\stick{knots I am speaking of, may it please}
\stick{your reverences to believe, that I mean}
\natch{good,}
\stick{good, honest, devilish tight, hard knots,}
\stick{made \i{bona fide}, as \i{Obadiah} made his;\tsk}
\stick{in which there is no quibbling provision}
\stick{made by the duplication and return of}

\stick{the several obstructions, which, may it}
\stick{please your reverences, such knots cast}
\stick{in our way in getting through life\tsh}
\stick{every hasty man can whip out his pen-}

\stick{wrong. Believe me, Sirs, the most vir-}

\stick{he tried his fingers\tsk alas! the nails of}
\stick{his fingers and thumbs were cut close.\tsk}
\stick{The deuce take it! I can make nothing}
\stick{of it either way, cried \drslop.\tsh The}
\stick{trampling over head near my mother’s}
\stick{bed side increased.\tsk Pox take the fellow!}
\stick{I shall never get the knots untied as long}
\stick{as I live.\tsh My mother gave a groan\tsk}
\stick{Lend me your penknife\tsk I must e’en cut}
\stick{the knots at last - - - - - pugh! - - - psha!}

My father had a great respect for \i{Oba}-\break
\stick{\i{diah},  and could not bear to hear him}
\stick{disposed  of in such a manner\tsh he had}
\stick{moreover some little respect for him-}
\stick{self\tsh and could as ill bear with the in-}
dignity offer’d to himself in it.

Had \drslop cut any part about him,\break
\stick{but his thumb\tsh my father had pass’d}
\stick{it by\tsh his prudence had triumphed:}
\stick{as it was, he was determined to have his}
revenge.

Small curses, \drslop, upon great oc-\break
\stick{casions, quoth my father (condoling}
\stick{with him first upon the accident) are but}
\stick{so much waste of our strength and soul’s}
\stick{health to no manner of purpose.\tsk I own}
\natch{it,}
\stick{it, replied \drslop.\tsk They are like}
\stick{sparrow shot, quoth my uncle \toby, (sus-}
\stick{pending his whistling) fired against a}

\stick{father, to stir the humours\tsk but carry}
\stick{off none of their acrimony:\tsk for my own}
\stick{part, I seldom swear or curse at all\tsh}
\stick{I hold it bad\tsk but if I fall into it, by}
\stick{surprize, I generally retain so much pre-}
\stick{sence of mind (right, quoth my uncle}
\stick{\toby) as to make it answer my purpose\tsk}
\stick{that is, I swear on, till I find myself easy.}
\stick{A wise and a just man however would}
\stick{always endeavour to proportion the vent}
\stick{given to these humours, not only to the}
\stick{degree of them stirring within himself\tsk}
\stick{but to the size and ill intent of the of-}
\stick{fence upon which they are to fall.\tsh}
\stick{\lqq\i{Injuries come only from the heart},\kern0.1pt”\tsh}
\stick{quoth my uncle \i{Toby.} For this reason,}
\stick{continued my father, with the most \i{Cer-}}
\natch{\i{vantick}}
\stick{\i{vantick} gravity, I have the greatest vene-}
\stick{ration in the world for that gentleman,}
\stick{who, in distrust of his own discretion in}

\stick{suitable to all cases, from the lowest to}
\stick{the highest provocations which could}
\stick{possibly happen to him,\tsk which forms}
\stick{being well consider’d by him, and such}
\stick{moreover as he could stand to, he kept}

\dropcap{N}{ow} don’t let us give ourselves a\break
parcel of airs, and pretend that\break
\stick{the oaths we make free with in this land}
\stick{of liberty of ours are our own; and be-}
\stick{cause we have the spirit to swear them,}
\stick{\tsh imagine that we have had the wit to}
invent them too.
\patch{I’ll}

I’ll undertake this moment to prove it\break
\stick{to any man in the world, except to a}
\stick{connoisseur;\tsh though I declare I ob-}
\stick{ject only to a connoisseur in swearing,\tsh}
\stick{as I would do to a connoisseur in paint-}
\stick{ing, \&c.\@ \&c.\@ the whole set of ’em are so}
\stick{hung round and \i{befetish’d} with the bobs}
\stick{and trinkets of criticism,\tsh or to drop}
\stick{my metaphor, which by the bye is a pity,}
\stick{\tsh for I have fetch’d it as far as from}
\stick{the coast of \i{Guinea};\tsk their heads, Sir,}
\stick{are stuck so full of rules and compasses,}
\stick{and have that eternal propensity to apply}
\stick{them upon all occasions, that a work of}
\stick{genius had better go to the devil at once,}
\stick{than stand to be prick’d and tortured to}
death by ’em.

\tsh And how did \i{Garrick} speak the\break
\stck{soliloquy last night?\tsk Oh, against all rule,}
\stick{my Lord,\tsk most ungrammatically! be-}
\natch{twixt}
\stick{twixt the substantive and the adjective,}
\stick{which should agree together in \i{number},}
\stick{\i{case} and \i{gender}, he made a breach thus,\tsk}
\stick{stopping, as if the point wanted settling;}
\stick{\tsh and betwixt the nominative case,}
\stick{which your lordship knows should go-}
\stick{vern the verb, he suspended his voice}
\stick{in the epilogue a dozen times, three}
\stick{seconds and three fifths by a stop-watch,}
\stick{my Lord, each time.\tsh Admirable}
\stick{grammarian!\tsh But in suspending}
\stick{his voice\tsk was the sense suspended}
\stck{likewise? Did no expression of attitude or}
\stick{countenance fill up the chasm?\tsk Was}
\stck{the eye silent? Did you narrowly look?\tsk}
\stick{I look’d only at the stop-watch, my Lord.}
\stick{\tsh Excellent observer!\hfill}
\stick{\indent And what of this new book the whole}
\stick{world makes such a rout about?\tsk Oh!}
\stick{’tis out of all plumb, my Lord,\tsh}
\stick{quite an irregular thing!\tsk not one of}
\natch{the}
\stick{the angles at the four corners was a right}
\stick{angle.\tsk I had my rule and compasses,}
\stick{\&c.\@ my Lord, in my pocket.\tsh}
Excellent critic!

\tsh And for the epick poem, your\break
\stick{lordship bid me look at;\tsk upon tak-}
\stick{ing the length, breadth, height, and}
\stick{depth of it, and trying them at home}
\stick{upon an exact scale of \i{Bossu}’s,\tsh ’tis out,}
\stick{my Lord, in every one of its dimensions.}
\tsh Admirable connoisseur!

\tsh And did you step in, to take a look\break
\stick{at the grand picture, in your way back.\tsk}
\stick{\tsh ’Tis a melancholy daub! my Lord;}
\stick{not one principle of the \i{pyramid} in any}
\stick{one group!\tsh and what a price!\tsh}
\stick{for there is nothing of the colouring of}
\stick{\i{Titian},\tsk the expression of \i{Rubens},\tsk}
\stick{the grace of \i{Raphael},\tsk the purity of}
\natch{\i{Domi-}}
\stck{\i{Dominichino},\tsk the \i{corregiescity} of \i{Corregio},}
\stick{\tsk the learning of \i{Poussin},\tsk the airs of}
\stick{\i{Guido},\tsk the taste of the \i{Carrachi}’s,\tsk}
\stick{or the grand contour of \i{Angelo}.\tsh}
\stick{Grant me patience, just heaven!\tsh}
\stick{Of all the cants which are canted in this}
\stick{canting world,\tsh though the cant of}
\stick{hypocrites may be the worst,\tsk the cant of}
criticism is the most tormenting!

I would go fifty miles on foot, for I\break
\stick{have not a horse worth riding on, to kiss} 
\stick{the hand of that man whose generous}
\stick{heart will give up the reins of his imagi-}
\stick{nation into his author’s hands,\tsk be}
\stick{pleased he knows not why, and cares}
not wherefore.

Great \i{Apollo!}\@ if thou art in a giving\break
\stick{humour,\tsk give me,\tsk I ask no more,}
\stick{but one stroke of native humour, with}
\natch{a single}
\stick{a single spark of thy own fire along}
\stick{with it,\tsk and send \i{Mercury}, with the}
\stick{\i{rules and compasses}, if he can be spared,}
\stick{with my compliments to\tsh no matter.}

Now to any one else, I will undertake\break
\stick{to prove, that all the oaths and impreca-}
\stick{tions,  which we have been puffing off up-}
\stick{on  the world for these two hundred and} 
\stick{fifty years last past, as originals,\tsh ex-}
\stick{cept St.\@ \i{Paul}’s \i{thumb},\tsh \i{God’s flesh}}
\stick{\i{and God’s fish}, which were oaths mo-}
\stick{narchical, and, considering who made}
\stick{them, not much amiss; and as kings}
\stick{oaths, ’tis not much matter whether they}
\stick{were fish or flesh;\tsh else, I say, there is}
\stick{not an oath, or at least a curse amongst} 
\stick{them, which has not been copied over}
\stick{and over again out of \i{Ernulphus}, a thou-}
\stick{sand times: but, like all other copies,}
\stck{how infinitely short of the force and spirit}
\natch{of}
\stick{of the original!\tsk It is thought to be no}
\stick{bad oath,\tsh and by itself passes very}
\stick{well\tsh \lqq\i{G\kern 0.05pt -\kern 0.05pt -\kern 0.05pt -\kern 0.05pt d damn you.}”\tsh Set it}
\stick{beside \i{Ernulphus}’s\tsh \lqq God Almighty}
\stick{the Father damn you,\tsk God the Son} 
\stick{damn you,\tsk God the Holy Ghost damn} 
\stick{you,”\tsk you see ’tis nothing.\tsk There}
\stick{is an orientality in his, we cannot rise up}
\stick{to: besides, he is more copious in his in-}
\stick{vention\tsk possess’d more of the excel-}
\stick{lencies of a swearer,\tsh had such a tho-}
\stick{rough knowledge of the human frame,} 
\stick{its membranes, nerves, ligaments, knit-}
\stick{tings of the joints, and articulations,\tsk} 
\stck{that when \i{Ernulphus} cursed,\tsh no part es-}
\stick{caped him.\tsk ’Tis true, there is something}
\stick{of a \i{hardness} in his manner,\tsk and, as in} 
\stick{\i{Michael Angelo}, a want of \i{grace},\tsh but}
\tight{then there is such a greatness of \i{gusto!}}\tsk

My father, who generally look’d upon\break
\natch{every}
\stick{every thing in a light very different from}
\stick{all mankind,\tsh would, after all, never}
\stick{allow this to be an original.\tsh He con-}
\stick{sider’d rather \i{Ernulphus}’s anathema, as}
\stick{an institute of swearing, in which, as he}
\stick{suspected, upon the decline of \i{swearing}}
\stick{in some milder pontificate, \i{Ernulphus}, by}
\stick{order of the succeeding pope, had with}
\stick{great learning and diligence collected to-}
\stick{gether all the laws of it;\tsk for the same}
\stick{reason that \i{Justinian}, in the decline of the}
\stick{empire, had ordered his chancellor \i{Tri}-}
\stick{\i{bonian} to collect the \i{Roman} or civil laws}
\stick{all together into one code or digest,\tsk}
\stick{lest through the rust of time,\tsk and the}
\stick{fatality of all things committed to oral}
\stick{tradition, they should be lost to the}
world for ever.

For this reason my father would oft-\break
\stick{times affirm, there was not an oath, from}
\natch{the}
\stick{the great and tremendous oath of \i{William}}
\stick{the Conqueror, (\i{By the splendour of God})}
\stick{down to the lowest oath of a scavenger,}
\stick{(\i{Damn your eyes}) which was not to be}
\stick{found in \i{Ernulphus}.\tsk In short, he}
\stick{would add,\tsk I defy a man to swear \i{out} of}
it.

The hypothesis is, like most of my\break
\stick{father’s, singular and ingenious too;\tsh}
\stick{nor have I any objection to it, but that}
it overturns my own.

\dropcap{L}{et} us go back to the \astvi\break
\tsh in the last chapter.

It is a singular stroke of eloquence (at\break
\stck{least it was so, when eloquence flourished}
\stick{at \i{Athens} and \i{Rome}, and would be so}
\stick{now, did orators wear mantles) not to} 
\stick{mention the name of a thing, when you} 
\stick{had the thing about you, \i{in petto}, ready}
\stick{to produce, pop, in the place you want}
\stick{it. A scar, an axe, a sword, a pink’d-}
\stick{doublet, a rusty helmet, a pound and a} 
\stick{half of pot-ashes in an urn, or a three-}
\stick{halfpenny pickle pot\tsk but above all,} 
\stick{a tender infant royally accoutred.\tsk Tho’}
\stick{if it was too young, and the oration as} 
\stick{long as \i{Tully}’s second \i{Philippick},\tsk it}
\stick{must certainly have beshit the orator’s}
\natch{mantle.}
\stick{mantle.\tsk And then again, if too old,}
\stick{\tsk it must have been unwieldly and in-}
\stick{commodious to his action,\tsk so as to}
\stick{make him lose by his child almost as} 
\stick{much as he could gain by it.\tsk Otherwise,}
\stck{when a state orator has hit the precise age}
\stick{to a minute,\tsh hid his BAMBINO in his}
\stick{mantle so cunningly that no mortal could} 
\stick{smell it,\tsk and produced it so critically,} 
\stick{that no soul could say, it came in by head}
\stick{and shoulders,\tsk Oh, Sirs!\@ it has done}
\stick{wonders.\tsh It has open’d the sluices,}
\stick{and turn’d the brains, and shook the}
\stick{principles, and unhinged the politicks of} 
half a nation.

\tight{These feats however are not to be done,}\break
\stick{except in those states and times, I say,} 
\stick{where orators wore mantles,\tsk and pretty}
\stick{large ones too, my brethren, with some} 
\stick{twenty or five and twenty yards of good}
\natch{purple,}
\stick{purple, superfine, marketable cloth in}
\stick{them,\tsh with large flowing folds and}
\stick{doubles, and in a great stile of design.}
\stick{\tsh All which plainly shews, may it}
\stick{please your worships, that the decay of}
\stick{eloquence, and the little good service it} 
\stick{does at present, both within, and without} 
\stick{doors, is owing to nothing else in the}
\stick{world, but short coats, and the disuse of} 
\stick{\i{trunk-hose}.\tsh We can conceal nothing}

\stck{one point, so like the two lines which form}

\stick{would never have given them up;\tsh}

pray, good woman, after\break
all, will you take upon you\break
\stick{to say, it may not be the child’s hip, as}
\stick{well as the child’s head?\tsh ’Tis most}
\stick{certainly the head, replied the midwife.}
\stick{Because, continued \drslop, (turning to}
\stick{my father) as positive as these old ladies} 
\stick{generally are,\tsh ’tis a point very dif-}
\stick{ficult to know,\tsk and yet of the greatest}

\tsh What the possibility was, Dr.\break
\stck{\i{Slop} whispered very low to my father, and}
\stick{then to my uncle \toby.\tsh There is no}

\stick{\tsk No, in truth, quoth my father, \tsk but} 
\stick{when your possibility has taken place at}

head too.

\tsh It is morally impossible the reader\break

\dropcap[findent=1pt]{I}{t} is two hours, and ten minutes,\tsk\break
and no more,\tsh cried my father,\break
\stick{looking at his watch, since \drslop and}
\natch{\i{Obadiah}}
\stick{\i{Obadiah} arrived, \tsk\, and I know not}
\stick{how it happens, brother \toby, \tsk}
\stick{but to my imagination it seems almost}

\tsh Here\tsh pray, Sir, take hold\break
\stick{of my cap,\tsk nay, take the bell along}

Now, Sir, they are all at your service;\break
\stick{and I freely make you a present of ’em,}
\stick{on condition, you give me all your at-}
tention to this chapter.

Though my father said, \lqq\i{he knew not}\break
\stick{\lqq\i{how it happen’d},\,”\tsk yet he knew very}
\stick{well, how it happen’d;\tsh and at the}
\stck{instant he spoke it, was pre-determined in}
\stick{his mind, to give my uncle \toby a clear}
\stick{account of the matter by a metaphysical}
\stick{dissertation upon the subject of \i{duration}}
\natch{\i{and}}
\stick{\i{and its simple modes}, in order to shew my}
\stck{uncle \toby, by what mechanism and men-}
\stick{surations in the brain it came to pass, that}
\stck{the rapid succession of their ideas, and the}
\stick{eternal scampering of discourse from one}
\stick{thing to another, since \drslop had come}
\stick{into the room, had lengthened out so}
\stick{short a period, to so inconceivable an ex-}
\stick{tent.\tsk “\,I know not how it happens,}
\stick{\tsk cried my father,\tsk\lqq but it seems}
\lqq an age.”

\tsk ’Tis owing, entirely, quoth my uncle\break
\toby, to the succession of our ideas.

My father, who had an itch in com-\break
\stick{mon with all philosophers, of reasoning}
\stick{upon every thing which happened, and}
\stick{accounting for it too,\tsk proposed infinite}
\stick{pleasure to himself in this, of the succes-}
\stick{sion of ideas, and had not the least appre-}
\natch{hension}
\stick{hension of having it snatch’d out of his} 
\stick{hands by my uncle \toby, who (honest}
\stick{man!) generally took every thing as it}
\stick{happened;\tsh and who, of all men in} 
\stick{the world, troubled his brain the least} 
\stick{with abstruse thinking;\tsk the ideas of}
\stick{time and space,\tsk or how we came by}
\stick{those ideas,\tsk or of what stuff they were}
\stick{made,\tsk or whether they were born with}
\stick{us,\tsk or we pick’d them up afterwards} 
\stick{as we went along,\tsk or whether we did it}
\stick{in frocks,\tsk or not till we had got into}
\stck{breeches,\tsk with a thousand other inquiries}
\stck{and disputes about \textsc{infinity}, \textsc{prescience},} 
\stick{\s{liberty}, \s{necessity}, and so forth, upon}
\stck{whose desperate and unconquerable theo-}
\stck{ries, so many fine heads have been turned}
\stick{and crack’d,\tsh never did my uncle \toby's}
\stick{the least injury at all; my father knew it,}
\stick{\tsk and was no less surprised, than he}
\natch{was}
\stick{was disappointed with my uncle’s fortui-}
tous solution.

Do you understand the theory of that\break
affair? replied my father.

Not I, quoth my uncle.

\tsh But you have some ideas, said my\break
father, of what you talk about.\tsh

No more than my horse, replied my\break
uncle \toby.

Gracious heaven! cried my father,\break
\stick{looking upwards, and clasping his two}
\stick{hands together,\tsk there is a worth in thy}
\stick{honest ignorance, brother \toby\tsk ’twere}
\stick{almost a pity to exchange it for a know-}
ledge.\tsh But I’ll tell thee.\tsh
\patch{To}

To understand what \i{time} is aright,\break
\stick{without which we never can comprehend}
\stick{\i{infinity}, insomuch as one is a portion of}
\stick{the other,\tsk we ought seriously to sit}
\stick{down and consider what idea it is, we}
\stick{have of \i{duration}, so as to give a satisfacto-}
\stick{ry account, how we came by it.\tsk What is}
\stick{that to any body? quoth my uncle \toby.}
\stick{\fnast\ \i{For if you will turn your eyes inwards}}
\stick{\i{upon your mind}, continued my father, \i{and}}
\stick{\i{observe attentively, you will perceive, bro-}}
\stick{\i{ther,  that whilst you and I are talking to-}}
\stck{\i{gether, and thinking and smoaking our pipes:}}
\stick{\i{or whilst we receive successively ideas in our}}
\stick{\i{minds, we know that we do exist, and so we}}
\stck{\i{estimate the existence, or the continuation of}}
\stick{\i{the existence of ourselves, or any thing else}}
\stick{\i{commensurate to the succession of any ideas}}
\stick{\i{in our minds, the duration of ourselves, or}}
\stick{\i{any such other thing co existing with our}}
\stick{\hfill\i{think-}}

\stick{\i{thinking, \tsk and so according to that}}
\stick{\i{preconceived}\tsh You puzzle me to death,}
cried my uncle \toby.\tsk


\tsk ’Tis owing to this, replied my fa-\break 
\stick{ther, that in our computations of \i{time},} 
\stick{we are so used to minutes, hours, weeks,} 
\stick{and months,\tsk\!\tsk and of clocks (I wish}
\stick{there was not a clock in the kingdom) to} 
\stick{measure out their several portions to us,} 
\stick{and to those who belong to us,\tsk\!\tsk that} 
\stick{’twill be well, if in time to come, the}
\stick{\i{succession of our ideas} be of any use or} 
service to us at all.

Now, whether we observe it or no,\break
\stck{continued my father, in every sound man’s}
\stick{head, there is a regular succession of}
\stick{ideas of one sort or other, which follow}
\stick{each other in train just like\tsh A train} 
\stick{of artillery? said my uncle \toby.\tsk A train}
\natch{of}
\stick{of a fiddle stick!\tsk quoth my father,\tsk} 
\stick{which follow and succeed one another in}
\stick{our minds at certain distances, just like}
\stick{the images in the inside of a lanthorn} 
\stick{turned round by the heat of a candle.\tsk} 
\stick{I declare, quoth my uncle \toby, mine}

\stick{in one of the finest dispositions for it in}
\stick{the world;\tsk his head like a smoak-jack;}
\stick{\tsh the funnel unswept, and the ideas}
\natch{whirl-}

\stick{all obfuscated and darkened over with}

\stick{not, why then, by his ashes! by the ashes}
\stick{of my dear \i{Rabelais}, and dearer \i{Cervantes},}
\stick{\tsh my father and my uncle \toby's dis-}
\stick{course upon \s{time} and \s{eternity},\tsk was} 
\stck{a discourse devoutly to be wished for! and} 
\stick{the petulancy of my father’s humour in}
\stick{putting a stop to it, as he did, was a} 
\stick{robbery of the \i{Ontologic treasury}, of such} 
\stick{a jewel, as no coalition of great occasions}
\stick{and great men, are ever likely to restore} 
to it again.

\dropcap{T}{ho\lower2pt\hbox{’}} my father persisted in not\break
going on with the discourse,\tsk yet\break
\stick{he could not get my uncle \toby's smoak-}
\natch{jack}
\stick{jack out of his head,\tsk piqued as he was}
\stick{at first with it;\tsk there was something} 
\stick{in the comparison at the bottom, which}
\stick{hit his fancy; for which purpose resting}
\stick{his elbow upon the table, and reclining} 
\stick{the right side of his head upon the palm} 
\stick{of his hand,\tsh but looking first stedfast-}
\stick{ly in the fire,\tsh he began to commune}
\stick{with himself and philosophize about it:}
\stick{but his spirits being wore out with the}
\stick{fatigues of investigating new tracts, and} 
\stck{the constant exertion of his faculties upon} 
\stick{that variety of subjects which had taken} 
\stick{their turn in the discourse,\tsh the idea of} 
\stick{the smoak-jack soon turned all his ideas}
\stick{upside down,\tsk so that he fell asleep al-}
most before he knew what he was about.

As for my uncle \toby, his smoak-jack\break
\stick{had not made a dozen revolutions, before}
\natch{he}
\stick{he fell asleep also.\tsh Peace be with them} 
\stick{both.\,\tsk\, \drslop is engaged with the}

\dropcap{N}{o}, I’ll not say a word about it,\tsk\break
here it is;\tsk in publishing it,\tsk\break
\stick{I have appealed to the world,\tsh and to}
\stick{the world I leave it;\tsk it must speak for}
itself.

All I know of the matter is,\tsk when\break
\stick{I sat down, my intent was to write a good}
\stick{book; and as far as the tenuity of my}
\stick{understanding would hold out,\tsk a wise,}
\stick{aye, and a discreet,\tsk taking care only,}
\stick{as I went along, to put into it all the wit}
\stick{and the judgment (be it more or less)}
\stick{which the great author and bestower of}
\stick{them had thought fit originally to give}
\natch{me,}
\stick{me,\tsh so that, as your worships see,\tsk}
’tis just as God pleases.

\tight{Now, \i{Agalastes}\sic (speaking dispraisingly)}\break
\stick{sayeth, That there may be some wit in}
\stick{it, for aught he knows,\tsk but no judg-}
\stick{ment at all. And \i{Triptolemus} and \i{Phu}-}
\stick{\i{tatorius} agreeing thereto, ask, How is it}
\stick{possible there should? for that wit and}
\stick{judgment in this world never go toge-}
\stick{ther;  inasmuch as they are two opera-}
\stick{tions differing from each other as wide as}
\stick{east is from west.\tsk So, says \i{Locke},\tsk so}
\stick{are farting and hickuping, say I. But in}
\stick{answer to this, \i{Didius} the great church}
\stck{lawyer, in his code \i{de fartandi et illustrandi}}
\stick{\i{fallaciis}, doth maintain and make fully}
\stick{appear, That an illustration is no argu-}
\stick{ment,\tsk nor do I maintain the wiping of}
\stick{a looking-glass clean, to be a syllogism;}
\stick{\tsk but you all, may it please your wor-}
\natch{ships,}
\stick{ships, see the better for it,\tsh so that}
\stick{the main good these things do, is only}
\stick{to clarify the understanding, previous to}
\stick{the application of the argument itself, in}
\stick{order to free it from any little motes, or}
\stick{specks of opacular matter, which if left}
\stick{swiming therein, might hinder a concep-}
\stick{tion and spoil all.\hfill}
\stick{\indent Now, my dear Anti-Shandeans, and}
\stick{thrice able critics, and fellow-labourers,}
\stick{(for to you I write this Preface)\tsh and}
\stick{to you, most subtle statesman and dis-}
\stick{creet doctors (do\tsk pull off your beards)}
\stick{renowned for gravity and wisdom;\tsk}
\stick{\i{Monopolos} my politician,\tsk \i{Didius}, my}
\stick{counsel; \i{Kysarcius}, my friend;\tsk \i{Phutato}-}
\stck{\i{rius}, my guide;\tsk \i{Gastripheres}, the preserv-}
\stick{er of my life; \i{Somnolentius}, the balm and}
\stick{repose of it,\tsk not forgetting all others as}
\stck{well sleeping as waking,\tsk ecclesiastical as}
\stick{civil, whom for brevity, but out of no}
\natch{resent-}
\stick{resentment to you, I lump all together.}
\tsh Believe me, right worthy,

My most zealous wish and fervent\break
\stick{prayer in your behalf, and in my own}
\stick{too, in case the thing is not done already}
\stick{for us,\tsh is, that the great gifts and}
\stick{endowments both of wit and judgment,} 
\stck{with every thing which usually goes along}
\stick{with them,\tsh such as memory, fan-}
\stick{cy, genius, eloquence, quick parts, and} 
\stick{what not, may this precious moment} 
\stick{without stint or measure, let or hinder-}
\stick{ance, be poured down warm as each of}
\stick{us could bear it,\tsk scum and sediment an’}
\stick{all; (for I would not have a drop lost)}
\stck{into these veral receptacles, cells, cellules,}
\stick{domiciles, dormitories, refectories, and} 
\stick{spare places of our brains,\tsk in such sort,}
\stick{that they might continue to be injected} 
\stick{and tunn’d into, according to the true}
\natch{intent}
\stick{intent and meaning of my wish, until}
\stick{every vessel of them, both great and}
\stick{small, be so replenished, saturated and}
\stick{fill’d up therewith, that no more, would} 
\stick{it save a man’s life, could possibly be got} 
either in or out.\etp

\tight{Bless us!\tsk what noble work we should}
\stick{make!\tsh how should I tickle it off!}
\stick{\tsh and what spirits should I find myself}
\stick{in, to be writing away for such readers!}
\stick{\tsk and you,\tsk just heaven!\tsk\  with what}
\stick{raptures would you sit and read,\tsk but} 
\stick{oh!\tsk ’tis too much,\tsh I am sick,\tsh} 
\stick{I~faint away deliciously at the thoughts}
\stick{of it!\tsk ’tis more than nature can bear!}
\stick{\tsh lay hold of me,\tsk I am giddy,\tsk I} 
\stick{am stone blind,\tsk I’m dying,\tsk I am}
\stick{gone.\tsh\!\tsk Help! Help! Help!\tsh But}
\stick{hold,\tsk I grow something better again,}
\stck{for I am beginning to foresee, when this is} 
\stick{over, that as we shall all of us conti-}
\natch{nue}
\stick{nue to be great wits,\tsk we should never} 
\stick{agree amongst ourselves, one day to an} 
\stick{end:\tsh there would be so much satire} 
\stick{and sarcasm,\tsh scoffing and flouting,}
\stick{with raillying and reparteeing of it,\tsh}
\stick{thrusting and parrying in one corner or} 
\stick{another,\tsh there would be nothing but} 
\stick{mischief among us.\tsk Chaste stars! what}
\stick{biting and scratching, and what a racket}
\stick{and a clatter we should make, what with}
\stick{breaking of heads, and rapping of} 
\stick{knuckles, and hitting of sore places,\tsk} 
\stick{there would be no such thing as living} 
for us.\etp

But then again, as we should all of us\break
\stick{be men of great judgment, we should}
\stick{make up matters as fast as ever they went}
\stick{wrong; and though we should abominate}
\stick{each other, ten times worse than so many}
\stick{devils or devilesses, we should neverthe-}
\stick{less, my dear creatures, be all courtesy}
\natch{and}
\stick{and kindness,\tsk\!\tsk milk and honey,\tsh}
\stick{’twould be a second land of promise,\tsk\!\tsk}
\stick{a paradise upon earth, if there was such a}
\stick{thing to be had,\tsk so that upon the whole}
we should have done well enough.

All I fret and fume at, and what most\break
\stck{distresses my invention at present, is how}
\stick{to bring the point itself to bear; for as}
\stick{your worships well know, that of these}
\stck{heavenly emanations of \i{wit} and \i{judgment},}
\stick{which I have so bountifully wished both}
\stick{for your worships and myself,\tsk there is}
\stick{but a certain \i{quantum} stored up for us all,}
\stick{for the use and behoof of the whole race}
\stick{of mankind; and such small \i{modicums} of}
\stick{’em are only sent forth into this wide}
\stick{world, circulating here and there in one}
\stick{by corner or another,\tsk and in such nar-}
\stick{row streams, and at such prodigious in-}
\stick{tervals from each other, that one would}
\natch{wonder}
\stick{wonder how it holds out, or could be suf-}
\stick{ficient for the wants and emergencies of}
\stick{so many great states, and populous em-}
pires.

Indeed there is one thing to be consi-\break
\stick{dered, that in \i{Nova Zembla}, \i{North Lap}-}
\stick{\i{land}, and in all those cold and dreary}
\stick{tracts of the globe, which lie more di-}
\stick{rectly under the arctick and antartick cir-}
\stick{cles,\tsh where the whole province of a}
\stick{man’s concernments lies for near nine}
\stick{months together, within the narrow com-}
\stick{pass of his cave,\tsk\!\tsk where the spirits are}
\stick{compressed almost to nothing,\tsk\!\tsk and}
\stck{where the passions of a man, with every}
\stick{thing which belongs to them, are as frigid}
\stick{as the zone itself;\tsk there the least quan-}
\stck{tity of \i{judgment} imaginable does the busi-}
\stick{ness,\tsk and of \i{wit},\tsk there is a total and}
\stick{an absolute saving,\tsk for as not one spark}
\natch{is}
\stick{is wanted,\tsk so not one spark is given.}
\stick{Angels and ministers of grace defend us!}
\stck{What a dismal thing would it have been to}
\stick{have governed a kingdom, to have fought}
\stick{a battle, or made a treaty, or run a match,}
\stick{or wrote a book, or got a child, or held a}
\stck{provincial chapter there, with so \i{plentiful a}}
\stick{\i{lack} of wit and judgment about~us! for}
\stick{mercy’s sake! let us think no more about}
\stick{it, but travel on as fast as we can south-}
\stick{wards into \i{Norway},\tsk crossing over}
\stick{\i{Swedeland}, if you please, through the}
\stick{small triangular province of \i{Angermania}}
\stick{to the lake of \i{Bothnia}; coasting along it}
\stick{through east and west \i{Bothnia}, down to}
\stck{\i{Carelia}, and so on, through all those states}
\stick{and provinces which border upon the far}
\stick{side of the \i{Gulf} of \i{Finland}, and the north}
\stick{east of the \i{Baltick}, up to \i{Petersbourg}, and}
\stick{just stepping into \i{Ingria};\tsh then}
\stick{stretching over directly from thence}
\natch{through}
\stick{through the north parts of the \i{Russian}}
\stick{empire\tsk leaving \i{Siberia} a little upon the}
\stick{left hand till we got into the very heart of}
\i{Russian} and \i{Asiatick Tartary}.

Now throughout this long tour which\break
\stick{I have led you, you observe the good}
\stick{people are better off by far, than in the}
\stick{polar countries which we have just left:}
\stick{\tsk for if you hold your hand over your}
\stick{eyes, and look very attentively, your\sic may}
\stick{perceive some small glimmerings (as it}
\stick{were) of wit, with a comfortable provi-}
\stick{sion of good plain \i{houshold} judgment,}
\stick{which taking the quality and quantity of}
\stick{it together, they make a very good shift}
\stick{with,\tsk and had they more of either the}
\stick{one or the other, it would destroy the}
\stick{proper ballance betwixt them, and I am}
\stck{satisfied moreover they would want occa-}
sions to put them to use.\patch{Now,}

Now, Sir, if I conduct you home \break
\stick{again into this warmer and more luxuri-}
\stick{ant island, where you perceive the spring}
\stick{tide of our blood and humours runs high,}
\stick{\tsk where we have more ambition, and} 
\stick{pride, and envy, and lechery, and other} 
\stck{whoreson passions upon our hands to go-}
\stick{vern and subject to reason,\tsk the \i{height} of}
\stick{our wit and the \i{depth} of our judgment,} 
\stick{you see, are exactly proportioned to the} 
\stck{\i{length} and \i{breadth} of our necessities,\tsk and}
\stick{accordingly, we have them sent down}
\stick{amongst us in such a flowing kind of de-}
\stick{cent and creditable plenty, that no one} 
thinks he has any cause to complain.

It must however be confessed on this\break
\stick{head, that, as our air blows hot and cold,}
\stick{\tsh wet and dry, ten times in a day, we}
\stick{have them in no regular and settled way;}
\stick{\tsh so that sometimes for near half a}
\natch{century}
\stick{century together, there shall be very little}
\stick{wit or judgment, either to be seen or}
\stick{heard of amongst us:\tsk the small chan-}
\stick{nels of them shall seem quite dried up,\tsk}
\stck{then all of a sudden the sluices shall break}
\stick{out, and take a fit of running again like}
\stick{fury,\tsh you would think they would ne-}
\stick{ver stop:\tsh and then it is, that in writ-}
\stick{ing and fighting, and twenty other gal-}
\stick{lant things, we drive all the world be-}
fore us.

It is by these observations, and a wary\break
\stick{reasoning by analogy in that kind of ar-}
\stick{gumentative process, which \i{Suidas} calls}
\stick{\i{dialectick induction},\tsk that I draw and set}
\stick{up this position as most true and veri-}
table.

That of these two luminaries, so much\break
\stick{of their irradiations are suffered from}
\natch{time}
\stick{time to time to shine down upon us; as}
\stick{\stk{he, whose infinite wisdom which dispenses}}
\stick{every thing in exact weight and measure,}
\stick{knows will just serve to light us on our}
\stick{way in this night of our obscurity; so}
\stick{that your reverences and worships now}
\stick{find out, nor is it a moment longer in my}
\stick{power to conceal it from you, That the}
\stick{fervent wish in your behalf with which I}
\stick{set out, was no more than the first insi-}
\stick{nuating \i{How d’ye} of a caressing prefacer}
\stick{stifling his reader, as a lover sometimes}
\stick{does a coy mistress into silence. For alas!}
\stick{could this effusion of light have been as}
\stick{easily procured, as the exordium wished}
\stick{it\tsk I tremble to think how many thou-}
\stick{sands for it, of benighted travellers (in}
\stick{the learned sciences at least) must have}
\stick{groped and blundered on in the dark, all}
\stick{the nights of their lives,\tsh running their}
\stick{heads against posts, and knocking out}
\natch{their}
\stick{their brains without ever getting to their}
\stick{journies end;\tsk some falling with their}
\stck{noses perpendicularly into stinks,\tsk others}
\stick{horizontally with their tails into kennels.}
\stick{Here one half of a learned profession tilt-}
\stick{ing full butt against the other half of it,}
\stick{and then tumbling and rolling one over}
\stick{the other in the dirt like hogs.\tsk Here}
\stick{the brethren, of another profession, who}
\stick{should have run in opposition to each}
\stick{other, flying on the contrary like a flock}
\stick{of wild geese, all in a row the same way.}
\stick{\tsk What confusion!\tsk what mistakes!}
\stick{\tsh fiddlers and painters judging by their}
\stick{eyes and ears,\tsk admirable!\tsk trusting to}
\stick{the passions excited in an air sung, or a}
\stick{story painted to the heart,\tsk instead of}
measuring them by a quadrant.

In the foreground of this picture, a\break
\stick{\i{statesman} turning the political wheel, like}
\natch{a brute,}
\stick{a brute, the wrong way round\tsk \i{against}} 
\stick{the stream of corruption,\tsk by heaven!\tsk}
instead of \i{with} it.

In this corner, a son of the divine\break
\stick{\i{Esculapius}, writing a book against pre-}
\stick{destination; perhaps worse,\tsk feeling his}
\stck{patient’s pulse, instead of his apothecary’s}
\stick{\tsk a brother of the faculty in the back} 
\stck{ground upon his knees in tears,\tsk drawing}
\stick{the curtains of a mangled victim to beg} 
\stick{his forgiveness;\tsk offering a fee,\tsk instead} 
of taking one.


\tight{In that spacious \s{hall}, a coalition of the}\break
\stick{gown, from all the barrs of it, driving a\sic}
\stick{a damn’d, dirty, vexatious cause before}
\stick{them, with all their might and main, the\sic}
\stick{the wrong way;\tsh kicking it \i{out} of the} 
\stick{great doors, instead of, \i{in},\tsh and with} 
\stick{such fury in their looks, and such a de-}
\natch{gree}
\stick{gree of inveteracy in their manner of}
\stick{kicking it, as if the laws had been origi-}
\stck{nally made for the peace and preservation}
\stick{of mankind:\tsk perhaps a more enormous} 
\stick{mistake committed by them still,\tsk a li-}
\stick{tigated point fairly hung up;\tsk for in-}
\stick{stance, Whether \i{John o’\thinspace Nokes} his nose,}
\stick{could stand in \i{Tom o’\thinspace Stiles} his face, with-}
\stick{out a trespass, or not,\tsk rashly determin-}
\stick{ed by them in five and twenty minutes,}
\stick{which, with the cautious pro’s and con’s} 
\stick{required in so intricate a proceeding,}
\stick{might have taken up as many months,\tsk} 
\stick{and if carried on upon a military plan, as} 
\stck{your honours know, an \s{action} should be,}
\stick{with all the stratagems practicable there-}
\stick{in,\tsk such as feints,\tsk forced marches,\tsk}
\stick{surprizes,\tsk ambuscades,\tsk mask-batte-}
\stick{ries, and a thousand other strokes of ge-}
\stick{neralship which consist in catechising at}
\stick{all advantages on both sides,\tsh might}
\natch{rea-}
\stick{reasonably have lasted them as many}
\stick{years, finding food and raiment all that}
\stick{term for a centumvirate of the profes-}
sion.


As for the clergy\tsh\!\tsh No\tsh If
\stick{I say a word against them, I’ll be shot.\tsk}
\stick{I have no desire,\tsk and besides, if I had,}
\stick{\tsh I durst not for my soul touch upon} 
\stick{the subject,\tsh with such weak nerves} 
\stick{and spirits, and in the condition I am in}
\stick{at present, ’twould be as much as my life} 
\stick{\stick{was worth, to deject and contrist my-}} 
\stick{self with so sad and melancholy an ac-}
\stick{count,\tsk and therefore, ’tis safer to draw}
\stick{a curtain across, and hasten from it, as} 
\stick{fast as I can, to the main and principal} 
\stick{point I have undertaken to clear up,\tsh} 
\stick{and that is, How it comes to pass, that} 
\stick{your men of least \i{wit} are reported to be} 
\stick{men of most \i{judgment}.\tsh But mark,\tsk}
\natch{I say,}
\stick{I say, \i{reported to be},\tsk for it is no more,}
\stick{my dear Sirs, than a report, and which}
\stick{like twenty others taken up every}
\stick{day upon trust, I maintain to be a vile}
\stick{and a malicious report into the bar-}
gain.

\tight{This by the help of the observations al-}
\stck{ready premised, and I hope already weigh-}
\stck{ed and perpended by your reverences and}
\stick{worships, I shall forthwith make ap-}
pear.

I hate set dessertations,\tsh and above
\stick{all things in the world, ’tis one of the sil-}
\stick{liest things in one of them, to darken} 
\stick{your hypothesis by placing a number of} 
\stick{tall, opake words, one before another, in} 
\stick{a right line, betwixt your own and your}
\stick{readers conception,\tsh when in all like-}
\stick{lihood, if you had looked about you,}
\natch{might}
\stick{might have seen something standing, or}
\stick{hanging up, which would have cleared}
\stick{the point at once,\tsk \lqq for what hinde-}
\stick{\lqq rance, hurt or harm, doth the laudable}
\stick{\lqq desire of knowledge bring to any man,}
\stick{\lqq if even from a sot, a pot, a fool, a stool, a}
\stick{\lqq winter-mittain, a truckle for a pully,}
\stick{\lqq the lid of a goldsmith’s crucible, an oyl}
\stick{\lqq bottle, an old slipper, or a cane chair,”}
\stick{\tsk I am this moment sitting upon one.} 
\stick{Will you give me leave to illustrate this}
\stick{affair of wit and judgment, by the two} 
\stick{knobs on the top of the back of it,\tsh}
\stick{they are fasten’d on, you see, with two}
\stick{pegs stuck slightly into two gimlet-holes,} 
\stick{and will place what I have to say in so} 
\stick{clear a light, as to let you see through the} 
\stick{drift and meaning of my whole preface,} 
\stick{as plainly as if every point and particle}
of it was made up of sun beams.\patch{I enter}

I enter now directly upon the point.

\tsh Here stands \i{wit},\tsh and there
\stick{stands \i{judgment}, close beside it, just like}
\stick{the two knobbs I’m speaking of, upon} 
\stick{the back of this self same chair on which}
I am sitting.

\tsh You see, they are the highest and
\stick{most ornamental parts of its \i{frame},\tsh as}
\stick{wit and judgment are of \i{ours},\tsh and} 
\stick{like them too, indubitably both made}
\stick{and fitted to go together, in order, as we}
\stick{say in all such cases of duplicated embel-}
lishments,\tsh \i{to answer one another}.

\tight{Now for the sake of an experiment, and}
\stick{for the clearer illustrating this matter,\tsk} 
\stick{let us for a moment, take off one of these}
\stick{two curious ornaments (I care not which)} 
\stick{from the point or pinnacle of the chair it}
\natch{now}
\stick{now stands on;\tsh nay, don’t laugh at}
\stick{it.\tsh But did you ever see in the whole}
\stick{course of your lives such a ridiculous bu-}
\stick{siness as this has made of it?\tsh Why,}
\stick{’tis as miserable a sight as a sow with one}
\stick{ear; and there is just as much sense and}
\stick{symmetry in the one, as in the other:\tsk} 
\stick{do,\tsk pray, get off your seats, only to}
\stick{take a view of it.\tsh Now would any}
\stick{man who valued his character a straw,} 
\stick{have turned a piece of work out of his}
\stick{hand in such a condition?\tsk nay, lay} 
\stck{your hands upon your hearts, and answer} 
\stick{this plain question, Whether this one sin-}
\stick{gle knobb which now stands here like a} 
\stick{blockhead by itself, can serve any pur-}
\stick{pose upon earth, but to put one in mind}
\stick{of the want of the other;\tsh and let me} 
\stick{further ask, in case the chair was your}
\stick{own, if you would not in your consci-}
\stick{ences think, rather than be as it is, that}
\natch{it}
\stick{it  would be ten times better without any}
knobb at all.

Now these two knobs\tsh or top or-
\stck{naments of the mind of man, which crown}
\stick{the whole entablature,\tsk being, as I said,}
\stick{wit and judgment, which of all others, as} 
\stick{I have proved it, are the most needful,\tsh}
\stick{the most priz’d,\tsh the most calami-}
\stick{tous to be without, and consequently the}
\stick{hardest to come at,\tsk for all these rea-}
\stick{sons put together, there is not a mor-}
\stick{tal amongst us, so destitute of a love of}
\stick{good fame or feeding,\tsh or so ignorant} 
\stick{of what will do him good therein,\tsk who}
\stck{does not wish and stedfastly resolve in his}
\stick{own mind, to be, or to be thought at} 
\stick{least master of the one or the other, and}
\stick{indeed of both of them, if the thing} 
\stick{seems any way feasible, or likely to be}
brought to pass.\patch{Now}

Now your graver gentry having little
\stick{or no kind of chance in aiming at the}
\stick{one,\tsk unless they laid hold of the other,}

\stick{of all their \i{gravities}, they must e’en have} 
\stick{been contented to have gone with their}
\stick{insides naked:\tsk this was not to be borne,}
\stick{but by an effort of philosophy not to be}
\stick{supposed in the case we are upon,\tsh so}
\stick{that no one could well have been angry}
\stick{with them, had they been satisfied with}
\stick{what little they could have snatched up}
\stick{and secreted under their cloaks and great}
\stick{perrywigs, had they not raised a \i{hue} and}
\stick{\i{cry} at the same time against the lawful}
owners.

I need not tell your worships, that this
\stick{was done with so much cunning and arti-} 
\stick{fice,\tsk that the great \i{Locke}, who was sel-}
\natch{dom}
\stick{dom outwitted by false sounds,\tsk was}
\stick{nevertheless bubbled here. The cry, it}
\stick{seems, was so deep and solemn a one,} 
\stick{and what with the help of great wigs,}
\stick{grave faces, and other implements of de-}
\stck{ceit, was rendered so general a one against}
\stick{the \i{poor wits} in this matter, that the phi-}
\stick{losopher himself was deceived by it,\tsk it} 
\stick{was his glory to free the world from the}
\stick{lumber of a thousand vulgar errors;\tsh}
\stick{but this was not of the number; so that}
\stick{instead of sitting down cooly, as such a}
\stick{philosopher should have done, to have}
\stick{examined the matter of fact before he}
\stick{philosophised upon it;\tsk on the contra-}
\stick{ry he took the fact for granted, and so}
\stick{joined in with the cry, and halloo’d it as}
boisterously as the rest.

This has been made the \i{Magna Charta} 
\stick{of stupidity ever since,\tsh but your reve-}
\natch{rences}
\stick{rences plainly see, it has been obtained in}
\stick{such a manner, that the title to it is not}
\stick{worth a groat; \tsh which by the bye is}
\stick{one of the many and vile impositions} 
\stick{which gravity and grave folks have to an-}

\dropcap{W}{hen} corporal \i{Trim} had brought
his two mortars to bear, he was delighted with his handy-work
above\break
measure; and knowing what a pleasure it would be to his master to
see them, he was not able to resist the desire he had of carrying
them directly into his parlour.

Now next to the moral lesson I had in view in mentioning the
affair of \i{hinges}, I had a speculative consideration arising
out of it, and it is this.

Had the parlour-door open’d and\break
turn’d upon its hinges, as a door should do\tsh\patch{\tsk Or}

\tsk Or for example, as cleverly as our government has been
turning upon its hinges,\tsh (that is, in case things have all
along gone well with your worship,\tsk otherwise I give up my
simile)\tsk in this case, I say, there had been no danger either
to master or man, in corporal \i{Trim}’s peeping in: the
moment, he had beheld my father and my uncle \toby fast
asleep,\break\tsk the respectfulness of his carriage was such,
he would have retired as silent as death, and left them both in
their arm-chairs, dreaming as happy as he had\break found them:
but the thing was, morally speaking so very impracticable, that
for the many years in which this hinge was suffered to be out of
order, and amongst the hourly grievances my father submitted to
upon its account,\tsk this was one; that he never folded his
arms to take his nap after dinner, but the thoughts of be-
\natch{ing}
\stick{ing unavoidably awakened by the first}
\stick{person who should open the door, was} 
\stick{always uppermost in his imagination,}
\stick{and so incessantly step’d in betwixt him}
\stick{and the first balmy presage of his repose,}
\stick{as to rob him, as he often declared, of}
the whole sweets of it.

\noindent
\stck{\indent \lqq\i{When things move upon bad hinges}, an’}
please your lordships, \i{how can it be other-}\break
\i{wise?}

\noindent
\stick{\hfill Pray what’s the matter? Who is there?}
cried my father, waking, the moment\break the door began to creak.\tsh I wish the

ed hinge.\tsh ’Tis nothing, an’ please your honour, said
\i{Trim}, but two mortars I am bringing in.\tsh They
shan’t make a clatter with them here, cried my father
hastily.\tsh If \drslop has any
\natch{drugs}

\stick{kitchen.\tsk May it please your honour,} 
\stick{cried \i{Trim},\tsk they are two mortar-pieces}
\stick{for a siege next summer, which I have} 
\stick{been making out of a pair of jack-boots,}
\stick{which \i{Obadiah} told me your honour had}

\stck{to his breeches-pocket as he viewed them.}
\stick{\tsh I’ll pay you the ten pounds this mo-}

Brother \toby, replied my father, alter-
\stick{ing his tone, you care not what money}
\stick{you dissipate and throw away, provided,}
\stick{continued he, ’tis but upon a \s{siege}.\tsk}
\stick{Have I not a hundred and twenty pounds} 
\stick{a year, besides my half-pay? cried my} 
\stick{uncle \toby.\tsh What is that, replied  my} 
\stick{father, hastily,\tsk to ten pounds for a}

\stick{dear brother \toby, continued my father,}
\stck{taking him kindly by the hand,\tsk these mi-}

\stick{they do, brother, replied my uncle \toby,}
\stick{so long as we know ’tis for the good of}

My father could not help smiling for his soul;\tsk his anger at

simplicity of \i{Trim},\tsh and the generous
\natch{(tho’}

You must know, my uncle \toby mis-

\dropcap{T}{ho}’ the shock my uncle \toby re-\break
ceived the year after the demoli-\break
tion of \i{Dunkirk}, in his affair with widow \i{Wadman}, had fixed
him in a resolution never more to think of the sex,\tsk or of
aught which belonged to it;\tsk yet corporal \i{Trim} had made
no such bargain with himself. Indeed in my uncle
\toby's case there was a strange and unaccountable
concurrence of circumstances which in-
\natch{sensibly}
sensibly drew him in, to lay siege to that\break
fair and strong citadel.\tsh In \i{Trim}’s case\break
there was a concurrence of nothing in the\break
world, but of him and \i{Bridget} in the\break
kitchen;\tsk though in truth, the love and\break
veneration he bore his master was such,\break
and so fond was he of imitating him in\break
all he did, that had my uncle \toby em-\break
ployed his time and genius in tagging of\break
points,\tsh I am persuaded the honest\break
corporal would laid\sic\ down his arms, and\break
followed his example with pleasure.\break
When therefore my uncle \toby sat down\break
before the mistress,\tsk corporal \i{Trim} in-\break
continently took ground before the maid.

Now, my dear friend \i{Garrick}, whom 
\stick{I have so much cause to esteem and ho-}
\stick{nour,\tsk (why, or wherefore, ’tis no mat-}
\stick{ter)\tsk can it escape your penetration,\tsk I}
\stick{defy it,\tsk that so many play-wrights, and}
\natch{opificers}
\stick{opificers of chit chat have ever since been} 
\stick{\stck{working upon \i{Trim}’s and my uncle \toby's}}
\stick{pattern.\tsh I care not what \i{Aristotle}, or} 
\stick{\i{Pacuvius}, or \i{Bossu}, or \i{Ricaboni} say,\tsk} 
\stick{(though I never read one of them)\tsh} 
\stick{there is not a greater difference between}
\stick{a single-horse chair and madam \i{Pompa}-}
\stick{\i{dour}’s \i{vis} a \i{vis}, than betwixt a single}
\stick{amour, and an amour thus nobly dou-}
\stick{bled, and going upon all four, prancing} 
\stick{throughout a grand drama.\tsk Sir, a sim-}
\stick{ple, single, silly affair of that kind,\tsh} 
\stick{is quite lost in five acts,\tsh but that is}
neither here nor there.

\tight{After a series of attacks and repulses in}
\stick{a course of nine months on my uncle \i{To}-}
\stick{\i{by}’s quarter, a most minute account of}
\stick{every particular of which shall be given}
\stick{in its proper place, my uncle \toby, ho-}
\stick{nest man! found it necessary to draw off}
\natch{his}
\stick{his forces, and raise the siege somewhat}
indignantly.


Corporal \i{Trim}, as I said, had made no
\stick{such bargain either with himself\tsh or} 
\stick{with any one else,\tsh the fidelity however} 
\stick{of his heart not suffering him to go into a}
\stck{house which his master had forsaken with} 
\stick{disgust,\tsh he contented himself with}
\stick{turning his part of the siege into a block-}
\stick{ade;\tsk that is, he kept others off,\tsk}
\stick{for though he never after went to the} 
\stick{house, yet he never met \i{Bridget} in the vil-}
\stick{lage, but he would either nod or wink,} 
\stick{or smile, or look kindly at her,\tsk or (as}
\stick{circumstances directed), he would shake} 
\stick{her by the hand,\tsk or ask her lovingly} 
\stick{how she did,\tsk or would give her a rib-}
\stick{ban,\tsk and now and then, though ne-}
\stick{ver but when it could be done with de-}
corum, would give \i{Bridget} a \tsh\patch{Pre-}

Precisely in this situation, did these
\stick{things stand for five years; that is, from} 
\stick{the demolition of \i{Dunkirk} in the year 13,} 
\stick{to the latter end of my uncle \toby's cam-}
\stick{paign in the year 18, which was about six} 
\stck{or seven weeks before the time I’m speak-}
\stick{ing of.\tsk When \i{Trim}, as his custom was,}
\stick{after he had put my uncle \toby to bed,} 
\stick{going down one moon-shiny night to see} 
\stick{that every thing was right at his fortifica-}
\stick{tions,\tsh in the lane separated from the}
\stck{bowling-green with flowering shrubs and} 
holly,\tsk he espied his \i{Bridget}.

As the corporal thought there was no\-thing in the world so well
worth shewing as the glorious works which he and my uncle
\toby had made, \i{Trim} courteous\-ly and gallantly took
her by the hand, and led her in: this was not done so private\-ly,
but that the foul-mouth’d trumpet of
\natch{Fame}
Fame carried it from ear to ear, till at length it reached my
father’s, with this untoward circumstance along with it,\break
\stck{that my uncle \toby's curious draw-bridge,} constructed and
painted after the \i{Dutch} fashion, and which went quite
across the ditch,\tsk was broke down, and some how or other
crush’d all to pieces that very night.

My father, as you have observed, had no great esteem for my
uncle \toby's\break hobby-horse,\tsk he thought it the most
ri-\break
\stck{diculous horse that ever gentleman mount-}
ed; and indeed unless my
uncle \toby vexed him about it, could never think of it once,
without smiling at it,\tsh so that it could never get lame
or happen any mischance, but it tickled my father’s
imagination beyond measure; but this being an accident much more to
his hu-
\natch{mour}
\stck{mour than any one which had yet befall’n} 
\stick{it, it proved an inexhaustible fund of en-}
\stick{tertainment to him,\tsh Well,\tsh but}
\stick{dear \i{Toby!} my father would say, do tell} 
\stick{us seriously how this affair of the bridge}
\stick{happened.\tsh How can you teaze me so} 
\stick{much about it? my uncle \toby would}
\stick{reply,\tsk I have told it you twenty times,}
\stick{word for word as \i{Trim} told it me.\tsk Pri-}
\stick{thee, how was it then, corporal? my fa-}
\stick{ther would cry, turning to \i{Trim.}\tsk It was}
\stick{a mere misfortune, an’ please your ho-}
\stick{nour,\tsk I was shewing Mrs.\@ \i{Bridget}}
\stick{our fortifications, and in going too near} 
\stick{the edge of the fossè, I unfortunately}
\stick{slip’d in.\tsk Very well, \i{Trim!}\@ my father} 
\stick{would cry,\tsk (smiling mysteriously, and}
\stick{giving a nod,\tsh but without inter-}
\stick{rupting him)\tsh and being link’d}
\stick{fast, an’ please your honour, arm in arm} 
\stick{with Mrs.\@ \i{Bridget}, I dragg’d her after}
\natch{me,}
\stck{me, by means of which she fell backwards}
soss against the bridge,\tsh and \i{Trim}’s
foot (my uncle \toby would cry, taking the story out of
his mouth) getting into the cuvette, he tumbled full against the
bridge too.\tsk It was a thousand to one, my uncle \toby
would add, that the poor 
\stick{fellow did not break his leg.\tsh Ay truly!}
my father would say,\tsh a limb is soon broke, brother
\toby, in such encounters.\break
\tsh And so, an’ please your honour, the bridge, which your
honour knows was a very slight one, was broke down betwixt us,
and splintered all to pieces.

At other times, but especially when 
\stck{my uncle \toby was so unfortunate as to say}
\stick{a syllable about cannons, bombs, or pe-}
\stick{tards,\tsk my father would exhaust all the} 
\stick{stores of his eloquence (which indeed}
\stick{were very great) in a panegyric upon the}
\natch{\s{bat-}}
\s{battering-rams} of the ancients,\tsk the 
\stck{\s{vinea} which \i{Alexander} made use of at the}
\stick{siege of \i{Tyre}.\tsk He would tell my uncle}
\stick{\toby of the \s{catapultæ} of the \i{Syrians}}
\stick{\tighter{which threw such monstrous stones so ma-}}
\stick{ny hundred feet, and shook the strongest}
\stick{\tight{bulwarks from their very foundation;\tsk he}}
would go on and
describe the wonderful mechanism of the \s{ballista}, which
\i{Mar\-cellinus} makes so much rout about,\tsk the terrible
effects of the \s{pyraboli},\tsk which cast fire,\tsk the
danger of the \s{terebra} and \textscl{scorpio}, which cast
javelins.\tsh But what are these, he would say, to the
destructive machinery of corporal \i{Trim?}\tsk
Believe me, brother \toby, no bridge, or bastion, or
sally port that ever was con-
\stck{structed in this world, can hold out against}
such artillery.

My uncle \toby would never attempt
\natch{any}
\stick{any defence against the force of this ridi-}
\stick{cule, but that of redoubling the vehe-}
\stick{mence of smoaking his pipe; in doing} 
\stick{which, he raised so dense a vapour one}
\stick{night after supper, that it set my father,} 
\stick{who was a little phthisical, into a suf-}
\stick{focating fit of violent coughing: my}
\stick{uncle \toby leap’d up without feeling the} 
\stick{pain upon his groin,\tsk and, with infinite}
\stick{pity, stood beside his brother’s chair, tap-}
\stick{ping his back with one hand, and hold-}
\stick{ing his head with the other, and from} 
\stick{time to time, wiping his eyes with a clean} 
\stick{cambrick handkerchief, which he pull’d} 
\stick{out of his pocket.\tsh The affectionate} 
\stick{and endearing manner in which my} 
\stick{uncle \toby did these little offices,\tsk cut}
\stick{my father thro’ his reins, for the pain he} 
\stick{had just been giving him.\tsh May my}
\stick{brains be knock’d out with a battering} 
\stick{ram or a catapulta, I care not which,}
\natch{quoth}
\stick{quoth my father to himself,\tsh if ever}
I insult this worthy soul more.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXV.}

\dropcap{T}{he} draw-bridge being held
irrepa\-rable, \i{Trim} was ordered directly\break 
\stick{to set about another,\tsh but not upon the} 
\stick{same model; for cardinal \i{Alberoni}’s in-}
\stick{trigues at that time being discovered,}
\stick{and my uncle \toby rightly foreseeing that}
\stick{a flame would inevitably break out be-}
\stick{twixt \i{Spain} and the Empire, and that the}
\stick{operations of the ensuing campaign must}
\stick{in all likelihood be either in \i{Naples} or}
\stick{\i{Sicily},\tsh he determined upon an \i{Italian}}
\stick{bridge,\tsk (my uncle \toby, by the bye,} 
\stick{was not far out of his conjectures)\tsh}
\stick{but my father, who was infinitely the}
\stick{better politician, and took the lead as far}
\stick{of my uncle \toby in the cabinet, as my}
\natch{uncle}
\stick{uncle \toby took it of him in the field,\tsh}
\stick{convinced him, that if the King of \i{Spain}}
\stick{and the Emperor went together by the}
\stick{ears, that \i{England} and \i{France} and \i{Hol}-}
\stick{\i{land} must, by force of their pre-engage-}
\stick{ments, all enter the lists too;\tsh and if} 
\stick{so, he would say, the combatants, bro-}
\stick{ther \toby, as sure as we are alive, will}
\stick{fall to it again, pell-mell, upon the old}
\stick{prize-fighting stage of \i{Flanders};\tsk then}
\tight{what will you do with your \i{Italian} bridge?}

\tsk We will go on with it then, upon the old model, cried my
uncle \toby.

When corporal \i{Trim} had about half finished it in that
stile,\tsh my uncle \toby found out a capital defect in
it, which he had never thoroughly considered before. It turned,
it seems, upon hinges at both ends of it, opening in the middle,
one
\natch{half}
\stick{half of which turning to one side of the} 
\stick{fossè, and the other, to the other; the ad-}
\stick{vantage of which was this, that by divid-}
\stick{ing the weight of the bridge into two} 
\stick{equal portions, it impowered my uncle} 
\stick{\toby to raise it up or let it down with the}
\stick{end of his crutch, and with one hand,} 
\stick{which, as his garrison was weak, was as} 
\stick{much as he could well spare,\tsk but the} 
\stck{disadvantages of such a construction were}
\stick{insurmountable,\tsh for by this means,}
\stick{he would say, I leave one half of my} 
\stick{bridge in my enemy’s possession,\tsh and}
pray of what use is the other?

The natural remedy for this, was no 
\stick{doubt to have his bridge fast only at one} 
\stick{end with hinges, so that the whole might} 
\stick{be lifted up together, and stand bolt up-}
\stick{right,\tsh but that was rejected for the}
reason given above.\patch{For}

For a whole week after he was deter-
\stick{mined in his mind to have one of that}
\stick{particular construction which is made} 
\stick{to draw back horizontally, to hinder a}
\stick{passage; and to thrust forwards again to}
\stick{gain a passage,\tsh of which sorts your} 
\stick{worship might have seen three famous}
\stck{ones at \i{Spires} before its destruction,\tsk and}
\stick{one now at \i{Brisac}, if I mistake not;\tsh}
\stick{but my father advising my uncle \toby,} 
\stick{with great earnestness, to have nothing}
\stick{more to do with thrusting bridges,\tsk and}
\stick{my uncle foreseeing moreover that it}
\stick{would but perpetuate the memory of the}
\stick{corporal’s misfortune,\tsk he changed his} 
\stick{mind for that of the marquis \i{d}’\i{Hôpital}’s} 
\stick{invention, which the younger \i{Bernouilli}}

My uncle \toby understood the nature 
\stick{of a parabola as well as any man in \i{Eng}-}

\dropcap{F}{rom} the first moment I sat down\break
to write my life for the amusement\break
\stick{of the world, and my opinions for its in-}
\stick{struction, has a cloud insensibly been}
\stick{gathering over my father.\tsk A tide of} 
\stck{little evils and distresses has been setting}
\stick{in against him.\tsk Not one thing, as he}
\stick{observed himself, has gone right: and} 
\stick{now is the storm thicken’d, and going to}
\stick{break, and pour down full upon his}
head.

I enter upon this part of my story in the most pensive and
melancholy frame of mind, that ever sympathetic breast\break
was touched with.\tsh My nerves re-\break
lax as I tell it.\tsh Every line I write,\break
I feel an abatement of the quickness of
\natch{my}
my pulse, and of that careless alacrity\break
with it, which every day of my life\break
prompts me to say and write a thousand\break
things I should not.\tsh And this mo-\break
ment that I last dipp’d my pen into my\break
ink, I could not help taking notice what\break
a cautious air of sad composure and so-\break
lemnity there appear’d in my manner of\break
doing it.\tsh Lord! how different from\break

thee nothing.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXIX.}

\dropcap{\Usk{18pt}I}{won\lower2pt\hbox{’}t} go about to argue the\break
point with you,\tsk ’tis so,\tsk and
\natch{I am}
I am persuaded of it, madam, as much\break
as can be, \lqq That both man and woman\break
\lqq bear pain or sorrow, (and, for aught I\break
\lqq know, pleasure too) best in a horizon-\break
\lqq tal position.\,”

The moment my father got up into 
\stick{his chamber, he threw himself prostrate} 
\stck{across his bed in the wildest disorder ima-}
\stick{ginable, but at the same time in the most}
\stick{lamentable attitude of a man borne down} 
\stick{with sorrows, that ever the eye of pity} 
\stick{dropp’d a tear for.\tsh The palm of his} 
\stick{right hand, as he fell upon the bed, re-}
\stick{ceiving his forehead, and covering the}
\stick{greatest part of both his eyes, gently sunk} 
\stick{down with his head (his elbow giving} 
\stick{way backwards) till his nose touch’d the} 
\stick{quilt;\tsh his left arm hung insensible} 
\stick{over the side of the bed, his knuckles re-}
\stick{clining upon the handle of the chamber}
\natch{pot,}
\stick{pot, which peep’d out beyond the va-}
\stick{lance,\tsk his right leg (his left being}
\stick{drawn up towards his body) hung half}
\stick{over the side of the bed, the edge of it} 
\stick{pressing upon his shin-bone.\tsh He felt}
\stick{it not. A fix’d, inflexible sorrow took}
\stick{possession of every line of his face.\tsk He} 
\stick{sigh’d once,\tsk heaved his breast often,\tsk}
but utter’d not a word.

An old set-stitch’d chair, valanced and 
\stick{fringed around with party-colour’d wor-}
\stick{sted bobs, stood at the bed’s head, oppo-}
\stick{site to the side where my father’s head re-}
\stick{clined.\tsk My uncle \toby sat him down}
in it.

Before an affliction is digested,\tsh\break
\stick{consolation ever comes too soon;\tsk and} 
\stick{after it is digested,\tsk it comes too late:}
\stick{so that you see, madam, there is but a}
\natch{mark}
mark between these two, as fine almost as a hair, for a
comforter to take aim at: my uncle \toby was always
either on this
\stick{side, or on that of it, and would often say,}\break
He believed in his heart, he could as soon hit the longitude;
for this reason, when he sat down in the chair, he drew the
cur-tain a little forwards, and having a tear at every one’s
service,\tsk he pull’d out\break a cambrick handkerchief,\tsh gave a
low sigh,\tsh but held his peace.

\i{is not
gain that is got in-\break to the purse}.”\tsk So that\break
notwithstanding my father had the happiness of reading the
oddest books in the universe, and had moreover, in himself, the
oddest way of thinking, that ever
\natch{man}
\stick{man in it was bless’d with, yet it had this} 
\stick{drawback upon him after all,\tsh that it}
\stick{laid him open to some of the oddest and}
\stick{most whimsical distresses; of which this} 
\stick{particular one which he sunk under at} 
\stick{present is as strong an example as can be}
given.

No doubt, the breaking down of the 
\stick{bridge of a child’s nose, by the edge of a}
\stick{pair of forceps,\tsk however scientifically}
\stick{applied,\tsk would vex any man in the} 
\stick{world, who was at so much pains in be-}
\stick{getting a child, as my father was,\tsk}
\stick{yet it will not account for the extrava-}
\stick{gance of his affliction, or\sic will it justify}
\stck{the unchristian manner he abandoned and} 
surrender’d himself up to it.

To explain this, I must leave him upon
\natch{the}
\stick{the bed for half an hour,\tsh and my}
\stick{good uncle \toby in his old fringed chair} 
sitting beside him.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXXI.}

\initial{\Usk{20pt}I}{\lss{THINK}} it a very unreason-\break 
able demand,\tsk cried my great\break
grandfather, twisting up the paper,
and throwing it upon the table.\tsh By this account, madam, you
have but two thou\-sand pounds fortune, and not a shilling
more,\tsh and you insist upon having three hundred pounds a year
jointure for\break it.\tsh

\tsk \lqq Because,” replied my great-grand-\break
mother, \lqq you have little or no nose,\break
\lqq Sir.”\tsh

Now, before I venture to make use
\natch{of}
\stick{of the word \i{Nose} a second time,\tsk to} 
\stick{avoid all confusion in what will be said} 
\stick{upon it, in this interesting part of my}
\stick{story, it may not be amiss to explain my} 
\stck{own meaning, and define, with all possible}
\stick{exactness and precision, what I would} 
\stick{willingly be understood to mean by the}
\stick{term: being of opinion, that ’tis owing}
\stick{to the negligence and perverseness of}
\stick{writers, in despising this precaution, and} 
\stick{to nothing else,\tsh That all the polemi-}
\stick{cal writings in divinity, are not as clear}
\stick{and demonstrative as those upon \i{a Will o’}}
\stick{\i{the Wisp}, or any other sound part of phi-}
\stick{losophy, and natural pursuit; in order to}
\stick{which, what have you to do, before you} 
\stick{set out, unless you intend to go puzzling}
\stick{on to the day of judgment,\tsh but to}
\stick{give the world a good definition, and} 
\stick{stand to it, of the main word you have}
\stick{most occasion for,\tsh changing it, Sir, as}
\natch{you}
\stick{you would a guinea, into small coin?\tsk} 
\stick{which done,\tsk let the father of confusion} 
\stick{puzzle you, if he can; or put a different}
\stick{idea either into your head, or your} 
reader’s head, if he knows how.

In books of strict morality and close
\stick{reasoning, such as this I am engaged}
\stick{in,\tsk the neglect is inexcusable; and hea-}
\stick{ven is witness, how the world has re-}
\stick{venged itself upon me for leaving so}
\stick{many openings to equivocal strictures,\tsk}
\stick{and for depending so much as I have} 
\stick{done, all along, upon the cleanliness of} 
my reader’s imaginations.

\tsh Here are two senses, cried \i{Eu\-genius}, as we walk’d
along, pointing with the fore finger of his right hand to the
word \i{Crevice}, in the fifty-second page of the second
volume of this book of books,
\natch{\tsk here}
\tsh here are two senses,\tsk quoth he.\tsk And here are two
roads, replied I, turning short upon him,\tsh a dirty and a
clean one,\tsh which shall we take?\tsk\break
The clean,\tsk by all means, replied \i{Eu\-genius}.  \i{Eugenius},
said I, stepping before him, and laying my hand upon his\break
breast,\tsh to define\tsh is to distrust.\tsh\break
Thus I triumph’d over \i{Eugenius}; but I\break
triumph’d over him as I always do, like a fool.\tsh ’Tis my comfort however, I
am not an obstinate one; therefore

I define a nose, as follows,\tsk intreat\-ing only beforehand, and
beseeching my readers, both male and female, of what age,
complexion, and condition soever, for the love of God and their own
souls, to guard against the temptations and\break suggestions of the
devil, and suffer him by no art or wile to put any other
ideas
\natch{into}
\stick{into their minds, than what I put into my}
\stick{definition.\tsk For by the word \i{Nose},}
\stick{throughout all this long chapter of noses,}
\stick{and in every other part of my work,} 
\stick{where the word \i{Nose} occurs,\tsk I declare,} 
\stick{by that word I mean a Nose, and nothing} 
more, or less.

S’death! cried my great grandfather, clapping his hand

\tsh ’Twas shaped, Sir, like an ace of\break clubs.

\stick{quoth my grandmother to my grand-}

My father, replied my grandfather,\break had no more nose, my dear,
saving the mark, than there is upon the back of my\break
hand.\tsh

\tsk Now, you must know, that my great grandmother outlived my
grandfather twelve years; so that my father
\natch{had}
had the
jointure to pay, a hundred and fifty pounds half yearly\tsk (on
\i{Michael-\break mas} and \i{Lady day})\tsk during all
that\break
time.

No man discharged pecuniary obliga-
\stick{tions with a better grace than my fa-}
\stick{ther.\tsh And as far as the hundred} 
\stick{pounds went, he would fling it upon the}
\stick{table, guinea by guinea, with that spirit-}
\stick{ed jerk of an honest welcome, which ge-}
\stck{nerous souls, and generous souls only, are} 
\stick{able to fling down money: but as soon as} 
\stick{ever he enter’d upon the odd fifty,\tsk he}
\stick{generally gave a loud \i{Hem!} rubb’d the} 
\stick{side of his nose leisurely with the flat part}
\stick{of his fore finger,\tsh inserted his hand}
\stick{cautiously betwixt his head and the cawl}
\stick{of his wig,\tsk look’d at both sides of every}
\stick{guinea, as he parted with it,\tsk and seldom}
\natch{could}
\stick{could get to the end of the fifty pounds,}
\stick{without pulling out his handkerchief,}
and wiping his temples.

Defend me, gracious heaven! from 
\stck{those persecuting spirits who make no al-}
lowances for these workings within us.\tsk Never,\tsk O never may I lay down in their
tents, who cannot relax the engine, and feel pity for the force of
education, and the prevalence of opinions long derived from
ancestors!

For three generations at least, this \i{te\-net} in favour of
long noses had gradually been taking root in our family.\tsh
\s{Tradition} was all along on its side, and
\s{Interest} was every half year stepping in to strengthen
it; so that the whimsicality of my father’s brain was far
from
\natch{having}
having the whole honour of this, as it had of almost all his
other strange notions.\tsk For in a great measure he might be
said to have suck’d this in, with his mother’s milk. He did his
part however.\tsh If\break
education planted the mistake, (in case it\break was one) my father
watered it, and ri\-pened it to perfection.

He would often declare, in speaking his thoughts upon the
subject, that he did not conceive how the greatest family in
\i{England} could stand it out against an uninterrupted
succession of six or seven short noses.\tsk And for the contrary
reason, he would generally add, That it\break must be one of
the greatest problems in civil life, where the same number of long
and jolly noses following one another\break in a direct line, did not
raise and hoist it
\natch{up}
\stick{up into the best vacancies in the king-}
\stick{dom.\tsh He would often boast that the} 
\stick{\i{Shandy} family rank’d very high in king} 
\stick{\i{Harry} the VIIIth’s time, but owed its}
\stick{rise to no state engine,\tsk he would say,\tsk}
\stick{but to that only;\tsh but that, like other}
\stick{families, he would add,\tsh it had felt the}
\stick{turn of the wheel, and had never reco-}
\stick{vered the blow of my great grandfather’s} 
\stick{nose.\tsh It was an ace of clubs indeed,} 
\stick{he would cry, shaking his head,\tsk and} 
\stick{as vile a one for an unfortunate family,}
as ever turn’d up trumps.

\tsh Fair and softly, gentle reader!\break
\tsh where is thy fancy carrying thee?\break
\tsh If there is truth in man, by my
great grandfather’s nose, I mean the external organ of smelling,
or that part of man which stands prominent in his
face,
\natch{and}
\tsk and which painters say, in good jolly\break
\tight{noses and well-proportioned faces, should}\break
comprehend a full third,\tsh that is, measured
downwards from the setting on of the hair.\tsh

\tsh What a life of it has an author,\break at this pass!

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXXIV.}

\dropcap{I}{t} is a singular blessing, that nature\break
has form’d the mind of man with the \break
\stick{same happy backwardness and renitency}
\stk{against conviction, which is observed in old}
dogs,\tsk “of not learning new tricks.”

What a shuttlecock of a fellow would the greatest philosopher
that ever exist-\break ed, be whisk’d into at once, did he read
\natch{such}
such books, and observe such facts, and think such thoughts, as
would eternally be making him change sides!

Now, my father, as I told you last\break 
\stick{year, detested all this,\tsk He pick’d up an} 
\stick{opinion, Sir, as a man in a state of nature} 
\stick{picks up an apple.\tsk It becomes his own,\tsk}
\stick{and if he is a man of spirit, he would lose} 
his life rather than give it up.\tsh

I am aware, that \i{Didius}, the great civi-
\stick{lian, will contest this point; and cry out}
\stick{against me, Whence comes this man’s}
\stick{right to this apple? \i{ex confesso}, he will}
\stick{say,\tsh things were in a state of na-}
\stick{ture.\tsk The apple, as much \i{Frank}’s apple,} 
\stick{as \i{John}’s. Pray, Mr.\@ \i{Shandy}, what pa-}
\stick{tent has he to shew for it? and how did} 
\stick{it begin to be his? was it, when he set}
\natch{his}
\stick{his heart upon it? or when he gather’d} 
\stick{it? or when he chew’d it? or when he}
\stick{roasted it? or when he peel’d? or when}
\stick{he brought it home? or when he digest-}
\stick{ed?\tsh or when he\tsh\tsk ?\tsh. For} 
\stick{’tis plain, Sir, if the first picking up of}
\stick{the apple, made it not his,\tsh that no}
subsequent act could.

\tight{Brother \i{Didius}, \i{Tribonius} will answer,\tsk}\break
\stick{(now \i{Tribonius} the civilian and church} 
\stick{lawyer’s beard being three inches and a} 
\stick{half and three eighths longer than \i{Di}-}
\stick{\i{dius} his beard,\tsk I’m glad he takes up the}
\stick{cudgels for me, so I give myself no fur-}
\stick{ther trouble about the answer.)\tsk Brother}
\stick{\i{Didius}, \i{Tribonius} will say, it is a decreed} 
\stick{case, as you may find it in the fragments} 
\stick{of \i{Gregorius} and \i{Hermogenes}’s codes, and}
\stick{in all the codes from \i{Justinian}’s down to}
\natch{the}
\stick{the codes of \i{Louis} and \i{Des Eaux},\tsk That} 
\stick{the sweat of a man’s brows, and the ex-}
\stick{sudations of a man’s brains, are as much}
\stick{a man’s own property, as the breeches}
\stick{upon his backside;\tsk which said exsu-}
\stick{dations, \etc\@ being dropp’d upon the} 
\stick{said apple by the labour of finding it, and} 
\stick{picking it up; and being moreover in-}
\stck{dissolubly wasted, and as indissolubly an-}
\stick{nex’d by the picker up, to the thing}
\stick{pick’d up, carried home, roasted, peel’d,} 
\stick{eaten, digested, and so on;\tsh ’tis evi-}
\stick{dent that the gatherer of the apple, in so}
\stick{doing, has mix’d up something which} 
\stick{was his own, with the apple which was} 
\stick{not his own, by which means he has ac-}
\stick{quired a property;\tsk or, in other words,} 
the apple is \i{John}’s apple.

By the same learned chain of reason-
\natch{ing}
\stick{ing my father stood up for all his opi-}
\stick{nions: he had spared no pains in pick-}
\stick{ing them up, and the more they lay out}
\stick{of the common way, the better still was}
\stick{his title.\tsh No mortal claim’d them:}
\stick{they had cost him moreover as much la-}
\stick{bour in cooking and digesting as in the}
\stick{case above, so that they might well and}
\stick{truely be said to be of his own goods and}
\stick{chattles.\tsk Accordingly he held fast by}
\stick{’em, both by teeth and claws,\tsk would}
\stick{fly to whatever he could lay his hands}
\stick{on,\tsk and in a word, would intrench}
\stick{and fortify them round with as many cir-}
\stick{cumvallations and breast-works, as my}
uncle \toby would a citadel.

There was one plaguy rub in the way of this,\tsh the
scarcity of materials to make any thing of a defence with, in
case
\natch{of}
of a smart attack; inasmuch as few men of great genius had
exercised their parts in writing books upon the subject of\break 
great noses: by the trotting of my lean horse, the thing is
incredible!\@  and I am quite lost in my understanding when I am
considering what a treasure of precious time and talents
together has been wasted upon worse subjects,\tsk and how many
millions of books in all languages, and in all possible types and
bindings, have been fabricated upon points not half so much
tending to the unity and peace-making of the world.  What was to
be had, however, he set the greater store\break by; and though my
father would oft-times sport with my uncle \toby's
li-\break brary,\tsk which, by the bye, was ridi-\break culous enough,\tsk yet
at the very same time he did it, he collected every book
\natch{and}
\stck{and treatise which had been systematically} 
\stick{wrote upon noses, with as much care as} 
\stick{my honest uncle \toby had done those up-}
\stick{on military architecture.\tsh ’Tis true, a}
\stick{much less table would have held them,\tsk} 
\stick{but that was not thy transgression, my}
dear uncle.\tsh

Here,\tsh but why here,\tsh rather than in any
other part of my story,\tsh I am not able to
tell;\tsh but here it is,\tsh my heart stops me to
pay to\break
thee, my dear uncle \toby, once for all, the tribute I
owe thy goodness.\tsh Here\break
let me thrust my chair aside, and kneel\break
down upon the ground, whilst I am\break
pouring forth the warmest sentiments\break
of love for thee, and veneration for\break
the excellency of thy character, that\break
ever virtue and nature kindled in a
\natch{nephew’s}
nephew’s bosom.\tsh Peace and comfort rest for evermore upon thy
head!\tsk\break
Thou envied’st no man’s comforts,\tsh\break
insulted’st no man’s opinions.\tsh Thou\break
blackened’st no man’s character,\tsh\break
devoured’st no man’s bread: gently\break
with faithful \i{Trim} behind thee, didst\break

\stick{that \i{Slawkenbergius} should know whose}
\stick{finger touch’d the key,\tsh and whose}
\stick{hand it was that blew the bellows,\tsh}
\stck{as \i{Hafen Slawkenbergius} has been dead and} 
\stick{laid in his grave above fourscore and ten} 
years,\tsh we can only raise conjectures.

\i{Slawkenbergius} was play’d upon, for 
\stick{aught I know, like one of \i{Whitfield}’s}
\stick{disciples,\tsk that is, with such a distinct}
\stick{intelligence, Sir, of which of the two}
\stick{\i{masters} it was, that had been practising} 
\stick{upon his \i{instrument},\tsh as to make all} 
reasoning upon it needless.

\tsh For in the account which \i{Hafen} 
\stick{\i{Slawkenbergius} gives the world of his mo-}
\stick{tives and occasions for writing, and}
\stick{spending so many years of his life upon}
\natch{this}
\stick{this one work.\tsk Towards the end of his}
\stick{prolegomena, which by the bye should} 
\stick{have come first,\tsh but the bookbinder}
\stick{has most injudiciously placed it betwixt}
\stick{the analitical contents of the book, and} 
\stick{the book itself,\tsk he informs his reader,}
\stick{that ever since he had arrived at the age}
\stick{of discernment, and was able to sit down}
\stick{coolly, and consider within himself the}
\stick{true state and condition of man, and dis-}
\stick{tinguish the main end and design of his} 
\stick{being;\tsk or,\tsk to shorten my trans-}
\stick{lation, for \i{Slawkenbergius}’s book is in}
\stick{\i{Latin}, and not a little prolix in this pas-}
\stick{sage,\tsk ever since I understood, quoth}
\stick{\i{Slawkenbergius}, any thing,\tsk or rather}
\stick{\i{what was what},\tsk and could perceive}
\stick{that the point of long noses had been too}
\stick{loosely handled by all who had gone be-} 
\stick{fore;\tsh have I, \i{Slawkenbergius}, felt a}
\stick{strong impulse, with a mighty and an un-}
\natch{resistible}
\stick{resistible call within me, to gird up my-}
self to this undertaking.

\tight{And to do justice to \i{Slawkenbergius}, he}
\stick{has entered the list with a stronger lance,} 
\stick{and taken a much larger career in it, than}
\stick{any one man who had ever entered it} 
\stick{before him,\tsk and indeed, in many re-} 
\stck{spects, deserves to be \i{en-nich’d} as a proto-}
\stick{type for all writers, of voluminous works} 
\stick{at least, to model their books by,\tsh for}
\stick{he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject,\tsk} 
\stick{examined every part of it, \i{dialectically},\tsk}
\stick{then brought it into full day; dilucidat-}
\stick{ing it with all the light which either the} 
\stick{collision of his own natural parts could} 
\stick{strike,\tsk or the profoundest knowledge} 
\stick{of the sciences had impowered him to}
\stick{cast upon it,\tsk collating, collecting, and}
\stick{compiling,\tsk begging, borrowing, and} 
\stick{stealing, as he went along, all that had}
\natch{been}
\stick{been wrote or wrangled thereupon in the}
\stck{schools and porticos of the learned: so that}
\stick{\i{Slawkenbergius} his book may properly be}
\stick{considered, not only as a model,\tsk but as}
\stick{a thorough-stitch’d \s{digest} and regular} 
\stck{institute of \i{noses}; comprehending in it, all} 
\stick{that is, or can be needful to be known} 
about them.

For this cause it is, that I forbear to
\stick{speak of so many (\,otherwise\,) valuable}
\stick{books and treatises of my father’s collect-}
\stick{ing, wrote either, plump upon noses,\tsk}
\stick{or collaterally touching them;\tsh such} 
\stick{for instance as \i{Prignitz}, now lying upon}
\stick{the table before me, who with infinite} 
\stick{learning, and from the most candid and}
\stick{scholar-like examination of above four}
\stick{thousand different skulls, in upwards of}
\stck{twenty charnel houses in \i{Silesia}, which he}
\stick{had rummaged,\tsk has informed us, that}
\natch{the}
\stick{the mensuration and configuration of the}
\stck{osseous or boney parts of human noses, in}
\stick{any \i{given} tract of country, except \i{Crim}}
\stick{\i{Tartary}, where they are all crush’d down}
\stick{by the thumb, so that no judgment can be}
\stick{formed upon them,\tsh are much nearer} 
\stick{alike, than the world imagines;\tsh the} 
\stick{difference amongst them being, he says,} 
\stick{a mere trifle, not worth taking notice of,}
\stick{\tsh but that the size and jollity of every} 
\stick{individual nose, and by which one nose} 
\stick{ranks above another, and bears a higher} 
\stick{price, is owing to the cartilagenous and} 
\stick{muscular parts of it, into whose ducts and} 
\stck{sinuses the blood and animal spirits being} 
\stick{impell’d, and driven by the warmth and} 
\stick{force of the imagination, which is but a} 
\stick{step from it, (bating the case of ideots,} 
\stick{whom \i{Prignitz}, who had lived many} 
\stick{years in \i{Turky}, supposes under the more}
\stick{immediate tutelage of heaven)\tsk it so}
\natch{hap-}
\stick{happens, and ever must, says \i{Prignitz},} 
\stick{that the excellency of the nose is in a di-}
\stick{rect arithmetical proportion to the excel-}
lency of the wearer’s fancy.

It is for the same reason, that is, because ’tis all
comprehended in \i{Slawkenbergius}, that I say nothing likewise
of \stick{\i{Scroderus (Andrea)} who all the world} knows, set himself
to oppugn \i{Prignitz} with great violence,\tsk proving it in
his own way, first, \i{logically}, and then by\break
a series of stubborn facts, \lqq That so far\break
was \i{Prignitz} from the truth, in affirming 
that the fancy begat the nose, that on the 
contrary,\tsk the nose begat the fancy.\,”

\tsk The learned suspected \i{Scroderus}, of an indecent
sophism in this,\tsk and \i{Prignitz} cried out aloud in the
dispute, that \i{Scroderus} had shifted the idea upon
him,
\natch{but}
\tsk but \i{Scroderus} went on, maintaining his
thesis.\tsh

My father was just balancing within himself, which of the
two sides he should take in this affair; when
\i{Ambrose Paræus} decided it in a moment, and by
overthrowing the systems, both of \i{Prignitz} and
\i{Scroderus}, drove my father out of both sides of the
controversy at once.

Be witness\tsh

I don’t acquaint the learned reader,\tsk in saying it, I
mention it only to shew the learned, I know the fact
myself.\tsh

That this \i{Ambrose Paræus} was chief surgeon and
nose-mender to \i{Francis} the ninth of
\i{France}, and in high credit with him and the two
preceding, or succeed-
\natch{ing}
\stick{ing kings (I know not which)\tsk and that} 
\stick{except in the slip he made in his story of}
\stick{\i{Taliacotius}’s noses, and his manner of set-}
\stick{ting them on,\tsk was esteemed by the} 
\stick{whole college of physicians at that time,} 
\stick{as more knowing in matters of noses,} 
\stick{than any one who had ever taken them in} 
hand.

Now \i{Ambrose Paræus} convinced my 
\stick{father, that the true and efficient cause of} 
\stick{what had engaged so much the attention}
\stick{of the world, and upon which \i{Prignitz}}
\stick{and \i{Scroderus} had wasted so much learn-}
\stick{ing and fine parts,\tsh was neither this nor}
\stick{that,\tsh but that the length and good-}
\stick{ness of the nose was owing simply to the}
\stck{softness and flaccidity in the nurse’s breast,}
\stick{\tsh as the flatness and shortness of \i{puisne}}
\stick{noses was, to the firmness and elas-}
\stick{tic repulsion of the same organ of nutri-}
\natch{tion}
\stick{tion in the hale and lively,\tsk which, tho’} 
\stick{happy for the woman, was the undoing} 
\stick{of the child, inasmuch as his nose was so} 
\stck{snubb’d, so rebuff’d, so rebated, and so re-}
\stick{frigerated thereby, as never to arrive \i{ad}}
\stick{\i{mensuram suam legitimam};\tsh but that in} 
\stick{case of the flaccidity and softness of the}
\stick{nurse or mother’s breast,\tsk by sinking in-}
\stick{to it, quoth \i{Paræus}, as into so much but-}
\stick{ter, the nose was comforted, nourish’d,} 
\stick{plump’d up, refresh’d, refocillated, and}
set a growing for ever.

I have but two things to observe of 
\stick{\i{Paræus}; first, that he proves and ex-}
\stck{plains all this with the utmost chastity and}
\stick{decorum of expression:\tsk for which may}
his soul for ever rest in peace!

\tight{And, secondly, that besides the systems}
\stck{of \i{Prignitz} and \i{Scroderus}, which \i{Ambrose}}
\natch{\i{Paræus}}
\stick{\i{Paræus} his hypothesis effectually over-}
\stick{threw,\tsk it overthrew at the same time} 
\stick{the system of peace and harmony of our} 
\stick{family; and for three days together, not}
\stick{only embroiled matters between my fa-}
\stick{ther and my mother, but turn’d likewise}
\stick{the whole house and every thing in}
\stick{it, except my uncle \toby, quite upside}
down.

Such a ridiculous tale of a dispute be-
\stick{tween a man and his wife, never surely in}
\stick{any age or country got vent through the} 
key-hole of a street-door!

My mother, you must know,\tsh but
\stick{I have fifty things more necessary to let} 
\stick{you know first,\tsk I have a hundred dif-}
\stick{ficulties which I have promised to clear}
\stick{up, and a thousand distresses and domes-}

\dropcap{T}{here} was not any one scene more
entertaining in our family,\tsk and\break to do it justice in this
point;\tsh and I\break here put off my cap and lay it upon the\break
table close beside my ink-horn, on purpose to make my declaration
to the world concerning this one article, the more
so\-lemn,\tsh that I believe in my soul, (un-
\natch{less}
\stick{less my love and partiality to my under-}
\stick{standing blinds me) the hand of the su-}
\stick{preme Maker and first Designer of all}
\stick{things, never made or put a family toge-}
\stick{ther, (in that period at least of it, which I}
\stick{have sat down to write the story of)\tsh} 
\stick{where the characters of it were cast or} 
\stick{contrasted with so dramatic a felicity as} 
\stick{ours was, for this end; or in which the}
\stick{capacities of affording such exquisite}
\stick{scenes, and the powers of shifting them} 
\stick{perpetually from morning to night, were} 
\stick{lodged and intrusted with so unlimited a} 
confidence, as in the \s{Shandy-Family}.

Not any one of these was more divert-
\stick{ing, I say, in this whimsical theatre of} 
\stick{ours,\tsk than what frequently arose out of} 
\stick{this self-same chapter of long noses,\tsh}
\stick{especially when my father’s imagination}
\stck{was heated with the enquiry, and nothing}
\natch{would}
would serve him but to heat my uncle \toby's
too.

My uncle \toby would give my father
\stick{all possible fair play in this attempt; and}
\stck{with infinite patience would sit smoaking} 
\stick{his pipe for whole hours together, whilst}
\stick{my father was practising upon his head,} 
\stick{and trying every accessible avenue to}
\stick{drive \i{Prignitz} and \i{Scroderus}’s solutions} 
into it.

Whether they were above my uncle 
\stick{\toby's reason,\tsh or contrary to it,\tsh} 
\stick{or that his brain was like wet tinder, and}
\stick{no spark could possibly take hold,\tsh or} 
\stick{that it was so full of saps, mines, blinds,} 
\stick{curtins, and such military disqualifica-}
\stick{tions to his seeing clearly into \i{Prignitz}}
\stick{and \i{Scroderus}’s doctrines,\tsk I say not,\tsk} 
\stck{let school-men\tsk scullions, anatomists, and}
\natch{engi-}
engineers, fight for it amongst them-\break
selves,\tsh

’Twas some misfortune, I make no\break
doubt, in this affair,
that my father had every word of it to translate for the bene\-fit of
my uncle \toby, and render out of
\i{Slawkenbergius}’s \i{Latin}, of which, as he was no
great master, his translation was not always of the
purest,\tsk and generally\break \tight{least so where ’twas most
wanted,\tsk this} naturally open’d a door to a second
misfortune;\tsk \tight{that in the warmer paroxisms}\break
of his zeal to open my uncle \toby's eyes\break
\tsh my father’s ideas run on, as much faster than the translation, as
the translation outmoved my uncle
\toby's;\tsh\break
neither the one or the other added much\break
to the perspicuity of my father’s lecture.

length, which could not be brought together, to measure their
equality, by \i{juxta-position.}

Had the same great reasoner looked \stick{on, as my father illustrated
his systems of} noses, and observed my uncle \toby's
deportment,\tsk what great attention he gave to every
word,\tsk and as oft as he took his pipe from his mouth, with what
wonder-\break \tight{ful seriousness he contemplated the length} of
it,\tsk surveying it transversely as he held it betwixt his
finger and his thumb,\break\tsk then foreright,\tsk then
this way, and
\natch{then}
\stick{then that, in all its possible directions and}
\stick{foreshortenings,\tsh he would have con-}
\stick{cluded my uncle \toby had got hold of} 
\stick{the \i{medius terminus}; and was syllogizing}
\stick{and measuring with it the truth of each} 
\stick{hypothesis of long noses, in order, as my} 
\stick{father laid them before him. This by the} 
\stick{bye, was more than my father wanted,\tsk}
\stick{his aim in all the pains he was at in these}
\stick{philosophic lectures,\tsk was to enable my}
\stick{uncle \toby not to \i{discuss},\tsh but \i{com}-}
\stick{\i{prehend}\tsh to \i{hold} the grains and scru-}
\stick{ples of learning,\tsk not to \i{weigh} them.\tsk}
\stick{My uncle \toby, as you will read in the}
\stick{next chapter, did neither the one or the} 
other.\patch{\lsss{CHAP}.}

\dropcap{’T}{is} a pity, cried my father
one winter’s night, after a three hours\break
\stck{painful translation of \i{Slawkenbergius},\tsk ’tis}
\stick{a pity, cried my father, putting my mo-}
\stick{ther’s thread-paper into the book for a}
\stick{mark, as he spoke\tsh that truth, bro-}
\stick{ther \toby, should shut herself up in such} 
\stk{impregnable fastnesses, and be so obstinate}
\stick{as not to surrender herself sometimes up} 
upon the closest siege.\tsh

\noindent
\stick{\hfill Now it happened then, as indeed it had} often
done before, that my uncle \toby's fancy, during the
time of my father’s explanation of \i{Prignitz} to
him,\tsh having nothing to stay it there, had taken a short
flight to the bowling-green;\tsh his bo-\break
dy might as well have taken a turn there
\natch{too,}
\stick{too,\tsk so that with all the semblance of}
\stick{\tight{a deep school-man intent upon the \i{medius}}}
\i{terminus},\tsh my uncle \toby was in fact\break
as ignorant
of the whole lecture, and all its pro’s and con’s, as if my
father had been translating \i{Hafen Slawkenbergius}\break
from the \i{Latin} tongue into the \i{Cherokeè}.
But the word \i{siege}, like a talismanic\break
power, in my
father’s metaphor, wafting back my uncle \toby's
fancy, quick as a note could follow the touch,\tsk he open’d
his ears,\tsk and my father observing that he took his pipe
out of his mouth, and shuffled his chair nearer the table,
as with a desire to profit,\tsk my father with great
pleasure began his sentence again,\tsh changing only the
plan, and dropping the metaphor of the siege of it, to keep
clear of some dangers my father apprehended from it.

’Tis a pity, said my father, that truth can only be on one
side, brother \toby,\,\tsk\break
\stck{considering what ingenuity these learned}
men have all shewn in their solutions of
noses.\tsh Can noses be dissolved? repli\-ed my uncle
\toby.\tsh

\tsh My father thrust back his chair,\break
\tsh rose up,\tsk put on his
hat,\tsk took four long strides to the
door,\tsk jerked it open,\tsk thrust his head half
way out,\tsk shut the door again,\tsk took no
notice of the bad hinge,\tsk returned to the
table,\tsk\break pluck’d my mother’s thread-paper out of
\i{Slawkenbergius}’s book,\tsk went hastily to his
bureau,\tsk walk’d slowly back, twisting my mother’s
thread-paper about his thumb,\tsk unbutton’d his
waistcoat,\tsh threw my mother’s thread-paper into the
fire,\tsk bit her sattin pin-cushion in two, fill’d
his mouth with bran,\tsk confound-\break ed it;\tsk but mark!\tsk the
oath of confu-
\natch{sion}
\stck{sion was levell’d at my uncle \toby's brain,}
\stick{\tsh which was e’en confused enough al-}
\stick{ready,\tsh the curse came charged only} 
\stick{with the bran,\tsk the bran, may it please}
\stick{your honours,\tsk was no more than pow-}
der to the ball.

’Twas well my father’s passions lasted
\stick{not long; for so long as they did last,}
\stick{they led him a busy life on’t, and it is one} 
\stick{of the most unaccountable problems that} 
\stick{ever I met with in my observations of}
\stick{human nature, that nothing should prove} 
\stick{my father’s mettle so much, or make his}
\stick{passions go off so like gun-powder, as the} 
\stick{unexpected strokes his science met with} 
\stick{from the quaint simplicity of my uncle}
\stick{\toby's questions.\tsh Had ten dozen of} 
\stick{hornets stung him behind in so many dif-}
\stick{ferent places all at one time,\tsk he could} 
\stick{not have exerted more mechanical func-}
\stick{tions in fewer seconds,\tsk or started half so}
\natch{much,}
\stick{much, as with one single \i{quære} of three} 
\stick{words unseasonably popping in full upon} 
him in his hobbyhorsical career.

’Twas all one to my uncle \toby\tsk he
\stick{smoaked his pipe on, with unvaried com-}
\stick{posure,\tsk his heart never intended offence} 
\stick{to his brother,\tsk and as his head could}
\stick{seldom find out where the sting of it lay,}
\stick{\tsh he always gave my father the credit} 
\stick{of cooling by himself.\tsh He was five} 
\stick{minutes and thirty-five seconds about it}
in the present case.

By all that’s good!\@ said my father, 
\stick{swearing, as he came to himself, and tak-}
\stick{ing the oath out of \i{Ernulphus}’s digest of} 
\stick{curses,\tsk (though to do my father justice}
\stick{it was a fault (as he told \drslop in the}
\stick{affair of \i{Ernulphus}) which he as seldom} 
\stick{committed as any man upon earth.)\tsh}
\stick{By all that’s good and great! brother}
\natch{\i{Toby,}}
\stick{\toby, said my father, if it was not for the}
aids of philosophy, which befriend one\break
so much as they do,\tsk you would put a\break
man beside all temper.\tsk Why, by the
\i{so}-\break\i{lutions} of noses, of which I was telling you, I meant as
you might have known, had you favoured me with one grain of
attention, the various accounts which\break
learned men of different
kinds of know\-ledge have given the world, of the causes of short and
long noses.\tsk There is no cause but one, replied my
uncle \toby,\tsk why one man’s nose is longer
than ano\-ther’s, but because that God pleases to
\stck{have it so.\tsk That is \i{Grangousier}’s
solution,} said
my father.\tsk ’Tis he, continued my uncle \toby,
looking up, and not regarding my father’s interruption, who
makes us all, and frames and puts us together in such forms and
proportions, and for such ends, as is agreeable to his
infinite\break\etp
\stick{wisdom.\tsh ’Tis a pious account, cried}
\natch{my}
my father,
but not philosophical,\tsk there is more religion in it than sound
science. ’Twas no inconsistent part of my uncle
\toby's character,\tsk that he feared God, and
reverenced religion.\tsh So the moment my father finished
his remark,\tsh\break
my uncle \toby fell a whistling \i{Lillabul-\break 
lero}, with more zeal (though more out\break
of tune) than usual.\tsh

What is become of my wife’s thread-\break paper?

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XLII.}

\dropcap[nindent=1pt]{N}{o} matter,\tsh as an appendage to\break
\tight{seamstressy, the thread-paper might}\break
be of some consequence to my
mother,\tsk of none to my father, \tight{as a mark in \i{Slaw\-kenbergius.
Slawkenbergius} in every page of}\break
him was a rich treasure of inexhaustible\break
knowledge to my father,\tsk he could not
\natch{open}
\stick{open him amiss; and he would often say} 
\stick{in closing the book, that if all the arts}
\stick{and sciences in the world, with the books}
\stick{which treated of them, were lost,\tsk}
\stick{should the wisdom and policies of go-}
\stick{vernments, he would say, through dis-}
\stick{use, ever happen to be forgot, and all} 
\stick{that statesmen had wrote, or caused to be} 
\stick{written, upon the strong or the weak}
\stick{sides of courts and kingdoms, should}
\stick{they be forgot also,\tsk and \i{Slawkenbergius}}
\stick{only left,\tsk there would be enough in him} 
\stick{in all conscience, he would say, to set} 
\stick{the world a-going again. A treasure} 
\stick{therefore was he indeed!\@ an institute of} 
\stick{all that was necessary to be known of} 
\stick{noses, and every thing else,\tsk at \i{matin},} 
noon, and vespers was \i{Hafen Slawkenber-\break 
gius} his recreation and delight: ’twas\break\etp
\stick{for ever in his hands,\tsh you would have}
\stick{sworn, Sir, it had been a canon’s prayer-}
\stick{book,\tsk so worn, so glazed, so contrited}
\natch{and}
\stick{and attrited was it with fingers and with}
\stick{thumbs in all its parts, from one end} 
even unto the other.

I am not such a bigot to \i{Slawkenber-\break
gius}, as my father;\tsk there is a fund in\break
\stick{him, no doubt; but in my opinion, the} 
\stick{best, I don’t say the most profitable,}
\stick{but the most amusing part of \i{Hafen}}
\stick{\i{Slawkenbergius}, is his tales,\tsh and, con-}
\stick{sidering he was a \i{German}, many of them} 
\stick{told not without fancy:\tsh these take up}
\stick{his second book, containing nearly one} 
\stick{half of his folio, and are comprehended}
\stick{in ten decads, each decad containing ten}
\stick{tales.\tsh Philosophy is not built upon}
\stck{tales; and therefore ’twas certainly wrong}
\stick{in \i{Slawkenbergius} to send them into the} 
\stick{world by that name;\tsk there are a few of} 
\stck{them in his eight, ninth, and tenth decads,}
\stck{which I own seem rather playful and spor-}
\stick{tive, than speculative,\tsk but in general}
\natch{they}
\stick{they are to be looked upon by the learn-}
\stick{ed as a detail of so many independent}
\stick{facts, all of them turning round some-}
\stick{how or other upon the main hinges of his}
\stick{subject, and collected by him with great}
\stick{fidelity, and added to his work as so ma-}
\stick{ny illustrations upon the doctrines of} 
noses.

As we have leisure enough upon our
\stick{hands,\tsk if you give me leave, madam,} 
\stick{I’ll tell you the ninth tale of his tenth}
decad.
