My uncle \textit{Toby}’s wish did \drslop a
\stck{disservice which his heart never intended} any man,\tsh Sir, it
confounded him\tsh and thereby putting his ideas first into
confusion, and then to flight, he could not rally them again for
the soul of him.

In all disputes,\tsh male or female,\tsh whether for honour, for
profit or for love,\break \tsk it makes no difference in the
case;\tsk nothing is more dangerous, madam, than a wish coming
sideways in this unexpect\-ed manner upon a man: the safest way
in general to take off the force of the wish, is, for the party
wished at, instantly to get upon his legs\tsk and wish the
\textit{wisher} something in return, of pretty near the same
value,\tsk so balancing the account upon the spot, you stand as
you were\tsk nay sometimes gain the advantage of the attack by
it.\patch{This}

This will be fully illustrated to the\break
world in my chapter of wishes.\tsh

\drslop did not understand the nature 
\stick{of this defence;\tsk he was puzzled with} 
\stick{it, and it put an entire stop to the dis-}
\stick{pute for four minutes and a half;\tsk} 
\stick{five had been fatal to it:\tsk my father saw}
\stick{the danger\tsk the dispute was one of the}
\stick{most interesting disputes in the world,}
\stick{\lqq Whether the child of his prayers and} 
\stick{\stick{endeavours should be born without a}} 
\stick{head or with one:”\tsk he waited to the} 
\stick{last moment to allow \drslop, in whose}
\stick{behalf the wish was made, his right of re-}
\stick{turning it; but perceiving, I say, that}
\stick{he was confounded, and continued look-}
\stick{ing with that perplexed vacuity of eye}
\stick{which puzzled souls generally stare with,}
\stick{\tsh first in my uncle \textit{Toby}’s face\tsk then}
\stick{in his\tsk then up\tsk then down\tsk then}\catch{east}

\stick{coasting it along by the plinth of the}
\stick{wainscot till he had got to the opposite}
\stick{point of the compass,\tsh and that he had} 
\stick{actually begun to count the brass nails} 
\stick{upon the arm of his chair\tsk my father} 
\stick{thought there was no time to be lost with}
\stick{my uncle \textit{Toby}, so took up the discourse} 
as follows.

\dropcap{\lower-10pt\hbox{\large “}%
\leaders\hrule width 1pt height 14.4pt depth -13.6pt\hskip .5em\thinspace W}{hat}
prodigious armies\break you had in \textit{Flanders!}\,”\tsh

\tight{Brother \textit{Toby}, replied my father, taking}
\stick{his wig from off his head with his right}
\stick{hand, and with his \textit{left} pulling out a} 
\stick{striped \textit{India} handkerchief from his right}
\stick{coat pocket, in order to rub his head,}\catch{as}
\stick{as he argued the point with my uncle} 
\textit{Toby.}\tsh

\tsh Now, in this I think my father\break
was much to blame; and I will give you\break
my reasons for it.

Matters of no more seeming conse-
\stick{quence in themselves than, \lqq\textit{Whether}}
\stick{\textit{my father should have taken off his wig}}
\stick{\textit{with his right hand or with his left},”\tsh}
\stick{have divided the greatest kingdoms, and} 
\stick{made the crowns of the monarchs who} 
\stick{governed them, to totter upon their}
\stick{heads.\tsk But need I tell you, Sir, that the} 
\stick{circumstances with which every thing in} 
\stick{this world is begirt, give every thing in}
\stick{this world its size and shape;\tsk and by} 
\stick{tightening it, or relaxing it, this way or}
\stick{that, make the thing to be, what it is\tsh}
\stick{great\tsk little\tsk good\tsk bad\tsk indifferent}\catch{or} 
\stick{or not indifferent, just as the case hap-}
pens.

As my father’s \textit{India} handkerchief was
\stick{in his right coat pocket, he should by no} 
\stick{means have suffered his right hand to}
\stick{have got engaged: on the contrary, in-}
\stick{stead of taking off his wig with it, as he}
\stick{did, he ought to have committed that}
\stick{entirely to the left; and then, when the} 
\stick{natural exigency my father was under of}
\stick{rubbing his head, call’d out for his hand-}
\stick{kerchief, he would have had nothing in} 
\stick{the world to have done, but to have put} 
\stick{his right hand into his right coat pocket} 
\stick{and taken it out;\tsk which he might have}
\stick{done without any violence, or the least}
\stick{ungraceful twist in any one tendon or}
muscle of his whole body.

In this case, (unless, indeed, my father\catch{had}
\stick{had been resolved to make a fool of him-}
\stick{self by holding the wig stiff in his left} 
\stick{hand\tsk or by making some nonsensical} 
\stick{angle or other at his elbow joint, or arm-}
\stick{pit)\tsk his whole attitude had been easy\tsk}
\stick{natural\tsk unforced: \textit{Reynolds} himself, as} 
\stick{great and gracefully as he paints, might}
have painted him as he sat.

Now, as my father managed this mat-
\stick{ter,\tsk consider what a devil of a figure}
my father made of himself.

\tsk In the latter end of Queen \textit{Anne}’s
\stick{reign, and in the beginning of the reign} 
\stick{of King \textit{George} the first\tsk \lqq\textit{Coat pockets}}
\stick{\textit{were cut very low down in the skirt.}”\tsh} 
\stick{I need say no more\tsh the father of mis-}
\stick{chief, had he been hammering at it a}
\stick{month, could not have contrived a worse} 
fashion for one in my father’s situation.\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

\dropcap[findent=2pt]{I}{t} was not an easy matter in any
king’s reign (unless you were as lean a subject as myself) to
have forced your hand diagonally, quite across your whole body, so
as to gain the bottom of your opposite coat-pocket.\tsh In
the year, one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, when this
happened, it was extremely difficult; so that when my uncle
\textit{Toby} discovered the transverse zig-zaggery of my
father’s approaches towards it, it instantly brought into his
mind those he had done duty in,\break
before the gate of St.\@ \textit{Nicolas};\tsk the\break
idea of which drew off his attention so
entirely from the subject in debate, that he had got his right
hand to the bell to ring up \textit{Trim}, to go and fetch
his map of \textit{Namur}, and his compasses and sector\catch{along} along with
it, to measure the returning angles of the traverses of that
attack,\tsk but particularly of that one, where he received his
wound upon his groin.

My father knit his brows, and as he knit them, all the blood in
his body seem\-ed to rush up into his face\tsh my uncle
\textit{Toby} dismounted immediately.

\initial{A}{Man}’s body and his mind, with
the utmost reverence to both I speak it, are exactly like a jerkin,
and a jerkin’s lining;\tsk rumple the one,\tsk you rumple
the other. There is one certain exception however in this case, and
that is,\catch{when} 
when you are so fortunate a fellow, as to\break
have had your jerkin made of a gum-\break
taffeta, and the body-lining to it, of a\break
sarcenet or thin persian.

\textit{Zeno}, \textit{Cleanthes}, \textit{Diogenes Babylonius}, 
\textit{Dionysius Heracleotes}, \textit{Antipater}, \textit{Panætius} and
\textit{Possidonius} amongst the \textit{Greeks};\tsh \textit{Cato} and
\textit{Varro} and \textit{Seneca} amongst the \textit{Romans};\tsk
\textit{Pantenus} and \textit{Clemens Alexan\-drinus} and \textit{Montaigne} amongst
the Christians; and a score and a half of good ho-\break
\stck{nest, unthinking, \textit{Shandean} people as ever}
\stick{lived, whose names I can’t recollect,\tsk} 
\stck{all pretended that their jerkins were made} 
\stick{after this fashion,\tsh you might have}
\stick{rumpled and crumpled, and doubled and}
\stick{creased, and fretted and fridged the out-}
\stick{sides of them all to pieces;\tsk in short,} 
\stick{you might have played the very devil} 
\stick{with them, and at the same time, not}\catch{one}
\stick{one of the insides of ’em would have been}
\stick{one button the worse, for all you had}
done to them.

I believe in my conscience that mine 
is made up somewhat after this sort:\tsh
\stick{for never poor jerkin has been tickled}
\stick{off, at such a rate as it has been these last}
\stick{nine months together,\tsh and yet I de-}
\stick{clare the lining to it,\tsk as far as I am a}
\stick{judge of the matter, is not a three-}
\stick{penny piece the worse;\tsk pell mell, hel-}
\stick{ter skelter, ding dong, cut and thrust,}
\stick{back stroke and fore stroke, side way and} 
\stick{long way, have they been trimming it}
\stick{for me:\tsk had there been the least gum-}
\stick{miness in my lining,\tsk by heaven! it} 
\stick{had all of it long ago been fray’d and}
fretted to a thread.

\tsk You Messrs.\@ the monthly
Review-\catch{ers!} ers!\tsh how could you cut and slash my jerkin as
you did?\tsh how did you know, but you would cut my lining
too?

Heartily and from my soul, to the protection of that Being who
will injure none of us, do I recommend you and your
affairs,\tsk so God bless you;\tsk only next month, if any one
of you should gnash his teeth, and storm and rage at me, as some of
you did last \textscl{May}, (in which I\break remember the weather
was very hot)\tsk don’t be exasperated, if I pass it by
again with good temper,\tsk being determined as long as I live or
write (which in my case means the same thing) never to give the
honest gentleman a worse word or a worse wish, than my uncle \textit{Toby} gave
the fly which buzz’d about his nose all
\textit{dinner time}, \tsh \lqq Go,\tsh go, poor
devil,\,” quoth he, “\tsh get thee gone,\tsh why\catch{\lqq should}

answer,\tsk are} \stick{these dangers greater now o’\,days,
bro-} ther, than in times past? Brother \textit{Toby}, answered
my father, if a child was but fairly begot, and born alive, and
healthy, and the mother did well after it,\tsk our forefathers
never looked further.\tsh My uncle \textit{Toby} instantly
withdrew his hand from off my father’s knee, reclined his body
gently back in his chair, raised his head till he could just see
the cornish of the room, and then directing the
buccina-\break
tory muscles along his cheeks, and the\catch{orbi-} 
orbicular muscles around his lips to do their duty\tsk he
whistled \textit{Lillabullero.}

% \null
\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  VII.}

\dropcap[findent=2pt]{W}{hilst} \tight{my uncle \textit{Toby} was whist-}\break
ling \textit{Lillabullero} to my father,\tsk\break 
\stick{\drslop was stamping, and cursing and}
\stick{damning at \textit{Obadiah} at a most dreadful}
\stick{rate;\tsh it would have done your heart}
\stick{good, and cured you, Sir, for ever, of} 
\stick{the vile sin of swearing to have heard}
\stick{him.\tsk I am determined therefore to re-}
late the whole affair to you.

When \drslop's maid delivered the 
green bays bag, with her master’s instruments in it, to \textit{Obadiah}, she
very sensibly exhorted him to put his head and one arm through
the strings, and ride with it slung across his body: so undoing
the\catch{bow-}
\stick{bow-knot, to lengthen the strings for}
\stick{him, without any more ado, she helped} 
\stick{him on with it. However, as this, in} 
\stick{some measure, unguarded the mouth of} 
\stick{the bag, lest any thing should bolt out in} 
\stick{galloping back at the speed \textit{Obadiah}}
\stick{threatened, they consulted to take it off} 
\stick{again; and in the great care and caution}
\stick{of their hearts, they had taken the two}
\stick{strings and tied them close (pursing up}
\stick{the mouth of the bag first) with half a} 
\stick{dozen hard knots, each of which, \textit{Oba-}}
\stick{\textit{diah}, to make all safe, had twitched and}
\stick{drawn together with all the strength of}
his body.

\tight{This answered all that \textit{Obadiah} and the}
\stick{maid intended; but was no remedy}
\stick{against some evils which neither he or}
\stick{she foresaw.  The instruments, it seems,}
\stick{as tight as the bag was tied above, had}\catch{so} 
\stick{so much room to play in it, towards the}
\stick{bottom, (the shape of the bag being} 
\stck{conical) that \textit{Obadiah} could not make a trot} 
\stick{of it, but with such a terrible jingle, what} 
\stck{with the \textit{tire-téte}, \textit{forceps} and \textit{squirt}, as}
\stck{would have been enough, had \textit{Hymen} been}
\stick{taking a jaunt that way, to have fright-}
\stick{ened him out of the country; but when}
\stick{\textit{Obadiah} accelerated this motion, and}
\stick{from a plain trot assayed to prick his}
\stick{coach-horse into a full gallop\tsk by hea-}
ven! Sir,\tsk the jingle was incredible.

As \textit{Obadiah} had a wife and three children.\tsk The
turpitude of fornication, and the many other political ill
consequences of this jingling, never once entered his
brain,\tsk he had however his objection, which came home
to himself, and weigh\-ed with him, as it has oft-times done with\catch{the}
the greatest patriots.\tsk “\textit{The poor fel}-\break
\stck{\itshape low, Sir, was not able to hear himself whistle.”\hfill}

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  VIII.}

\dropcap[findent=1pt]{A}{s} \textit{Obadiah} loved wind musick pre\-ferably to all the instrumental
mu\-sick he carried with him,\tsk he very considerately set his imagination to work, to
contrive and to invent by what means he should put himself in a condition of
enjoying it.

\tight{In all distresses (except musical) where}
\stick{small cords are wanted,\tsk nothing is so}
\stck{apt to enter a man’s head, as his hat-band:}
\tsh the philosophy of this is so near the
surface\tsk I scorn to enter into it.

As \textit{Obadiah}’s was a mix’d case,\tsh mark,
Sirs,\tsh I say, a mix’d case; for it\catch{was} was
obstetrical,\tsk \textit{scrip}-tical,\tsk squirtical,
papistical,\tsk and as far as the coach-horse
\stick{was concerned in it,\tsk caball-istical\tsk and} only partly
musical;\tsk \textit{Obadiah} made no scruple of availing himself
of the first expedient which offered;\tsk so taking hold of the bag and
instruments, and gripeing them hard together with one hand, and with the finger and thumb
of the other, \tight{putting the end of the hat-band betwixt his} teeth, and
then slipping his hand down to the middle of it,\tsk he tied and
cross-tied them all fast together from one end to\break
\stick{the other (as you would cord a trunk)} 
\stick{with such a multiplicity of round-abouts}
\stck{and intricate cross turns, with a hard knot}
\stick{at every intersection or point where the} 
\stick{strings met,\tsk that \drslop must have had} 
\stick{three fifths of \textit{Job}’s patience at least to} 
\stick{have unloosed them.\tsk I think in my con-}
\stick{science, that had \textsc{Nature} been in one of}\catch{her}
\stick{her nimble moods, and in humour for}
\stick{such a contest\tsh and she and \drslop}
\stick{both fairly started together\tsk there is no}
\stick{man living who had seen the bag with all}
\stick{that \textit{Obadiah} had done to it,\tsk and known}
\stick{likewise, the great speed the goddess can}
\stck{make when she thinks proper, who would} 
\stick{have had the least doubt remaining in his} 
\stick{mind\tsh which of the two would have} 
\stick{carried off the prize. My mother, ma-}
\stick{dam, had been delivered sooner than the}
\stick{green bag infallibly\tsh at least by twenty}
\stick{\textit{knots.}\tsh Sport of small accidents, \textit{Trist}-}
\stick{\textit{ram Shandy!} that thou art, and ever will} 
\stick{be! had that trial been made for thee, and} 
\stick{it was fifty to one but it had,\tsh thy af-}

\stck{so vexatiously, so tamely, so irrecoverably}
abandoned\tsk as thou hast been forced
to leave them!\tsk but ’tis over,\tsk all
but the account of ’em, which cannot be given to\break

\dropcap{G}{reat} wits jump: for the mo-\break 
ment \drslop cast his eyes upon\break
\stick{his bag (which he had not done till the}
\stick{dispute with my uncle \textit{Toby} about mid-}

My father had a great respect for \textit{Obadiah}, 
and could not bear to hear him 
\stick{disposed  of in such a manner\tsh he had} 
\stick{moreover some little respect for him-}
\stick{self\tsh and could as ill bear with the in-}
dignity offer’d to himself in it.

Had \drslop cut any part about him, but his
thumb\tsh my father had pass’d it by\tsh his
prudence had triumphed: as it was, he was determined to have his
revenge.

Small curses, \drslop, upon great oc-
\stick{casions, quoth my father (condoling}
\stick{with him first upon the accident) are but}
\stick{so much waste of our strength and soul’s}
\stick{health to no manner of purpose.\tsk I own}\catch{it,}
\stick{it, replied \drslop.\tsh They are like}
\stick{sparrow shot, quoth my uncle \textit{Toby}, (sus-}
\stick{pending his whistling) fired against a}
\stick{bastion.\tsh They serve, continued my} 
\stick{father, to stir the humours\tsk but carry}
\stick{off none of their acrimony:\tsk for my own}
\stick{part, I seldom swear or curse at all\tsh}
\stick{I hold it bad\tsk but if I fall into it, by} 
\stick{surprize, I generally retain so much pre-}
\stick{sence of mind (right, quoth my uncle} 
\stick{\textit{Toby}) as to make it answer my purpose\tsk}
\stick{that is, I swear on, till I find myself easy.}
\stick{A wise and a just man however would} 
\stick{always endeavour to proportion the vent}
\stick{given to these humours, not only to the}
\stick{degree of them stirring within himself\tsk}
\stick{but to the size and ill intent of the of-}
\stick{fence upon which they are to fall.\tsh}
\stick{\lqq\textit{Injuries come only from the heart},”\tsh}
\stick{quoth my uncle \textit{Toby.} For this reason,} 
\stick{continued my father, with the most \textit{Cer-}}\catch{\textit{vantick}} 
\stick{\textit{vantick} gravity, I have the greatest vene-}
\stick{ration in the world for that gentleman,}
\stick{who, in distrust of his own discretion in}
\stick{this point, sat down and composed (that}
\stick{is at his leisure) fit forms of swearing}
\stick{suitable to all cases, from the lowest to} 
\stick{the highest provocations which could} 
\stick{possibly happen to him,\tsk which forms}
\stick{being well consider’d by him, and such}
\stick{moreover as he could stand to, he kept} 
\stick{them ever by him on the chimney piece,} 
\stick{within his reach, ready for use.\tsk I ne-}
\stick{ver apprehended, replied \drslop, that} 
\stick{such a thing was ever thought of,\tsh}
\stick{much less executed. I beg your par-}

\dropcap{N}{ow} don’t let us give ourselves a\break
parcel of airs, and pretend that the oaths we make free with in
this land of liberty of ours are our own; and because we have the
spirit to swear them,\break\tsh imagine that we have had the wit
to invent them too.\patch{I’ll}

I’ll undertake this moment to prove it 
to any man in the world, except to a\break
connoisseur;\tsh though I declare I ob-\break
ject only to a connoisseur in swearing,\tsh as I would
do to a connoisseur in painting, \&c.\@ \&c.\@ the whole set of
’em are so hung round and \textit{befetish’d} with the
bobs and trinkets of criticism,\tsh or to drop my
metaphor, which by the bye is a pity,\break
\tsh for I have
fetch’d it as far as from the coast of
\textit{Guinea};\tsk their heads, Sir, are stuck so full of rules and compasses, and
have that eternal propensity to apply them upon all occasions, that
a work of genius had better go to the devil at once, than stand to
be prick’d and tortured to death by ’em.

\tsh And how did \textit{Garrick} speak the\break
\stck{soliloquy last night?\tsk Oh, against all rule,}\break
my Lord,\tsk most ungrammatically! be-\catch{twixt} twixt the substantive and the adjective, which
should agree together in \textit{number}, \textit{case} and \textit{gender}, he
made a breach thus,\tsk stopping, as if the point wanted
settling;\break\tsh and betwixt the nominative case, which your
lordship knows should go\-vern the verb, he suspended his voice\break
in the epilogue a dozen times, three\break
seconds and three fifths by a stop-watch,\break
\stick{my Lord, each time.\tsh Admirable}
\stick{grammarian!\tsh But in suspending}
\stick{his voice\tsh was the sense suspended}
\stck{likewise? Did no expression of attitude or}
\stick{countenance fill up the chasm?\tsh Was}
\stck{the eye silent? Did you narrowly look?\tsh}
\stick{I look’d only at the stop-watch, my Lord.}
\tsh Excellent observer!

And what of this new book the whole world makes such a rout
about?\tsk Oh! ’tis out of all plumb, my Lord,\tsh\break
quite an irregular thing!\tsk not one of\catch{the}
the angles at the four corners was a right angle.\tsk I had my rule
and compasses,
\stick{\&c.\@ my Lord, in my pocket.\tsh}\break
Excellent critic!

\tsh And for the epick poem, your\break
lordship bid me look at;\tsk upon tak-\break
ing the length, breadth, height, and\break
depth of it, and trying them at home\break
upon an exact scale of \textit{Bossu}’s,\tsh ’tis out,\break
my Lord, in every one of its dimensions.\break
\tsh Admirable connoisseur!

\tsh And did you step in, to take a look at the grand
picture, in your way back.\tsk\break

not one principle of the \textit{pyramid} in any one

\stick{hypocrites may be the worst,\tsk the cant of} 
criticism is the most tormenting!

I would go fifty miles on foot, for I 
\stick{have not a horse worth riding on, to kiss} 
\stick{the hand of that man whose generous}
\stick{heart will give up the reins of his imagi-}
\stick{nation into his author’s hands\tsh be}

\textit{rules and compasses}, if he can be spared,
with my compliments to\tsh no matter.

Now to any one else, I will undertake
\stick{to prove, that all the oaths and impreca-}
\stick{tions,  which we have been puffing off up-}
\stick{on  the world for these two hundred and} 
\stick{fifty years last past, as originals,\tsh ex-}
\stick{cept St.\@ \textit{Paul}’s \textit{thumb},\tsh \textit{God’s flesh}}
\stick{\textit{and God’s fish}, which were oaths mo-}
\stick{narchical, and, considering who made}
\stick{them, not much amiss; and as kings}
\stick{oaths, ’tis not much matter whether they}
\stick{were fish or flesh;\tsh else, I say, there is}
\stick{not an oath, or at least a curse amongst} 
\stick{them, which has not been copied over}
\stick{and over again out of \textit{Ernulphus}, a thou-}
\stick{sand times: but, like all other copies,}
\stck{how infinitely short of the force and spirit}\catch{of}
\stick{of the original!\tsk It is thought to be no}
\stick{bad oath,\tsh and by itself passes very}
\stick{well\tsh \lqq\textit{G\kern 0.05pt -\kern 0.05pt -\kern 0.05pt -\kern 0.05pt d damn you.}”\tsh Set it}
\stick{beside \textit{Ernulphus}’s\tsh \lqq God Almighty}
\stick{the Father damn you,\tsk God the Son} 
\stick{damn you,\tsk God the Holy Ghost damn} 
\stick{you,”\tsk you see ’tis nothing.\tsk There}
\stick{is an orientality in his, we cannot rise up}
\stick{to: besides, he is more copious in his in-}
\stick{vention\tsk possess’d more of the excel-}
\stick{lencies of a swearer,\tsh had such a tho-}
\stick{rough knowledge of the human frame,} 
\stick{its membranes, nerves, ligaments, knit-}
\stick{tings of the joints, and articulations,\tsk} 
\stck{that when \textit{Ernulphus} cursed,\tsh no part es-}
\stick{caped him.\tsk ’Tis true, there is something}
\stick{of a \textit{hardness} in his manner,\tsk and, as in} 
\stick{\textit{Michael Angelo}, a want of \textit{grace},\tsh but}
then there is such a greatness of \textit{gusto!}\tsk

My father, who generally look’d upon\catch{every} every thing in a
light very different from all mankind,\tsh would, after all, never
allow this to be an original.\tsh He consider’d rather
\textit{Ernulphus}’s anathema, as an institute of swearing, in
which, as he suspected, upon the decline of \textit{swearing} in some
milder pontificate, \textit{Ernulphus}, by order of the succeeding
pope, had with great learning and diligence collected together all
the laws of it;\tsk for the same reason that \textit{Justinian}, in
the decline of the empire, had ordered his chancellor
\textit{Tri\-bonian} to collect the \textit{Roman} or civil laws all
together into one code or digest,\tsh lest through the
rust of time,\tsk and the fatality of all things committed
to oral\break tradition, they should be lost to the\break world for
ever.

For this reason my father would oft-times affirm, there was not
an oath, from\catch{the} the great and tremendous oath of \textit{William} the
Conqueror, (\textit{By the splendour of God}) down to the lowest oath of a
scavenger, (\textit{Damn your eyes}) which was not to be found in
\textit{Ernulphus.}\tsh In short, he would add,\tsk I defy a man
to swear \textit{out} of\break it.

The hypothesis is, like most of my\break
father’s, singular and ingenious too;\tsh\break
nor have I any objection to it, but that\break
it overturns my own.

It is a singular stroke of eloquence (at
\stck{least it was so, when eloquence flourished}
\stick{at \textit{Athens} and \textit{Rome}, and would be so}
\stick{now, did orators wear mantles) not to} 
\stick{mention the name of a thing, when you} 
\stick{had the thing about you, \textit{in petto}, ready}
\stick{to produce, pop, in the place you want}
\stick{it. A scar, an axe, a sword, a pink’d-}
\stick{doublet, a rusty helmet, a pound and a} 
\stick{half of pot-ashes in an urn, or a three-}
\stick{halfpenny pickle pot\tsk but above all,} 
\stick{a tender infant royally accoutred.\tsk Tho’}
\stick{if it was too young, and the oration as} 
\stick{long as \textit{Tully}’s second \textit{Philippick},\tsk it}
\stick{must certainly have beshit the orator’s}\catch{mantle.}
\stick{mantle.\tsk And then again, if too old,}
\stick{\tsk it must have been unwieldly and in-}
\stick{commodious to his action,\tsk so as to}
\stick{make him lose by his child almost as} 
\stick{much as he could gain by it.\tsk Otherwise,}
\stck{when a state orator has hit the precise age}
\stick{to a minute,\tsh hid his BAMBINO in his}
\stick{mantle so cunningly that no mortal could} 
\stick{smell it,\tsk and produced it so critically,} 
\stick{that no soul could say, it came in by head}
\stick{and shoulders,\tsk Oh, Sirs!\@ it has done}
\stick{wonders.\tsh It has open’d the sluices,}
\stick{and turn’d the brains, and shook the}
\stick{principles, and unhinged the politicks of} 
half a nation.

\tight{These feats however are not to be done,} 
\stick{except in those states and times, I say,}

\stick{please your worships, that the decay of}

\tsh Here\tsh pray, Sir, take hold

Now, Sir, they are all at your service; 
\stick{and I freely make you a present of ’em,} 
\stick{on condition, you give me all your at-}
tention to this chapter.

Though my father said, \lqq\textit{he knew not}
\stick{\lqq\textit{how it happen’d},\,”\tsk yet he knew very}
\stick{well, how it happen’d;\tsh and at the} 
\stck{instant he spoke it, was pre-determined in}
\stick{his mind to give my uncle \textit{Toby} a clear}
\stick{account of the matter by a metaphysical}
\stick{dissertation upon the subject of \textit{duration}}\catch{\textit{and}}
\stick{\stck{\textit{and its simple modes}, in order to shew my}}
\stick{\stck{uncle \textit{Toby}, by what mechanism and men-}}
\stick{surations in the brain it came to pass, that} 
\stck{the rapid succession of their ideas, and the} 
\stick{eternal scampering of discourse from one}
\stick{thing to another, since \drslop had come} 
\stick{into the room, had lengthened out so} 
\stick{short a period, to so inconceivable an ex-}
\stick{tent.\tsk “\,I know not how it happens,}
\stick{\tsk cried my father,\tsk\lqq but it seems}
\lqq an age.”

\tsk ’Tis owing, entirely, quoth my uncle\break
\textit{Toby}, to the succession of our ideas.

My father, who had an itch in com-
\stick{mon with all philosophers, of reasoning}
\stick{upon every thing which happened, and}
\stick{accounting for it too,\tsk proposed infinite}
\stick{pleasure to himself in this, of the succes-}
\stick{sion of ideas, and had not the least appre-}\catch{hension} 
\stick{hension of having it snatch’d out of his} 
\stick{hands by my uncle \textit{Toby}, who (honest}
\stick{man!) generally took every thing as it}
\stick{happened;\tsh and who, of all men in} 
\stick{the world, troubled his brain the least} 
\stick{with abstruse thinking;\tsk the ideas of}
\stick{time and space,\tsk or how we came by}
\stick{those ideas,\tsk or of what stuff they were}
\stick{made,\tsk or whether they were born with}
\stick{us,\tsk or we pick’d them up afterwards} 
\stick{as we went along,\tsk or whether we did it}
\stick{in frocks,\tsk or not till we had got into}
\stck{breeches,\tsk with a thousand other inquiries}
\stck{and disputes about \textsc{infinity}, \textsc{prescience},} 
\stick{\textsc{liberty}, \textsc{necessity}, and so forth, upon}
\stck{whose desperate and unconquerable theo-}
\stck{ries, so many fine heads have been turned}
\stick{and crack’d,\tsh never did my uncle \textit{Toby}’s}
\stick{the least injury at all; my father knew it,}
\stick{\tsk and was no less surprised, than he}\catch{was} 
\stick{was disappointed with my uncle’s fortui-}
tous solution.

Do you understand the theory of that affair? replied my
father.

Not I, quoth my uncle.

\tsh But you have some ideas, said my father, of what you talk
about\tsh

No more than my horse, replied my uncle \textit{Toby}.

Gracious heaven! cried my father, looking upwards, and clasping
his two hands together,\tsk there is a worth in thy honest
ignorance, brother \textit{Toby}\tsk ’twere almost a pity to
exchange it for a know\-ledge.\tsh But I’ll tell
thee.\tsh\patch{To}

To understand what \textit{time} is aright,\break
\stick{without which we never can comprehend}\break
\textit{infinity}, insomuch as one is a
portion of the other,\tsk we ought seriously to sit down and
consider what idea it is, we\break

to any body? quoth my uncle \textit{Toby}.\break

\tight{and thinking and smoaking our pipes}:\break
or whilst we receive successively ideas in our
minds, we know that we do exist, and so we

\tsk ’Tis owing to this, replied my fa-\break 
\stick{ther, that in our computations of \textit{time},} 
\stick{we are so used to minutes, hours, weeks,} 
\stick{and months\tsh and of clocks (I wish}
\stick{there was not a clock in the kingdom) to} 
\stick{measure out their several portions to us,} 
\stick{and to those who belong to us,\tsh that} 
\stick{’twill be well, if in time to come, the}
\stick{\textit{succession of our ideas} be of any use or} 
service to us at all.

Now, whether we observe it or no, 
\stck{continued my father, in every sound man’s}
\stick{head, there is a regular succession of}
\stick{ideas of one sort or other, which follow}
\stick{each other in train just like\tsh A train}

swiming therein, might hinder a concep-
tion and spoil all.

Now, my dear Anti-Shandeans, and\break
thrice able critics, and
fellow-labourers (for to you I write this Preface)\tsh and
to you, most subtle statesman and discreet doctors (do\tsk pull
off your beards) renowned for gravity and
wisdom;\tsh \textit{Monopolos}, my
politician,\tsk \textit{Didius}, my counsel; \textit{Kysarcius}, my
friend;\tsk \smallit{Phutato\-rius}, my
guide;\tsk \smallit{Gastripheres}, the preserv\-er of my life;
\textit{Somnolentius}, the balm and repose of it,\tsk not
forgetting all others as 
\stck{well sleeping as waking,\tsk ecclesiastical as}
civil, whom for brevity, but out of no\catch{resent-}
resentment to you, I lump all together.\break
\tsh Believe me, right worthy,

My most zealous wish and fervent\break
\stick{prayer in your behalf, and in my own}
\stick{too, in case the thing is not done already}
\stick{for us,\tsh is, that the great gifts and}
\stick{endowments both of wit and judgment,} 
\stck{with every thing which usually goes along}
\stick{with them,\tsh such as memory, fan-}
\stick{cy, genius, eloquence, quick parts, and} 
\stick{what not, may this precious moment} 
\stick{without stint or measure, let or hinder-}
\stick{ance, be poured down warm as each of}
\stick{us could bear it,\tsk scum and sediment an’}
\stick{all; (for I would not have a drop lost)}
\stck{into these veral receptacles, cells, cellules,}
\stick{domiciles, dormitories, refectories, and} 
\stick{spare places of our brains,\tsk in such sort,}
\stick{that they might continue to be injected} 
\stick{and tunn’d into, according to the true}\catch{intent} 
\stick{intent and meaning of my wish, until}
\stick{every vessel of them, both great and}
\stick{small, be so replenished, saturated and}
\stick{fill’d up therewith, that no more, would} 
\stick{it save a man’s life, could possibly be got} 
either in or out.

\tight{Bless us!\tsk what noble work we should}
\stick{make!\tsh how should I tickle it off!}
\stick{\tsh and what spirits should I find myself}
\stick{in, to be writing away for such readers!}
\stick{\tsk and you,\tsk just heaven!\tsk\  with what}
\stick{raptures would you sit and read,\tsk but} 
\stick{oh!\tsk ’tis too much,\tsh I am sick,\tsh} 
\stick{I~faint away deliciously at the thoughts of}
\stick{it!\tsk ’tis more than nature can bear!}
\stick{\tsk lay hold of me,\tsh I am giddy,\tsk I} 
\stick{am stone blind,\tsk I’m dying,\tsk I am}
\stick{gone.\tsh Help! Help! Help!\tsh But}
\stick{hold,\tsk I grow something better again,}
\stck{for I am beginning to foresee, when this is} 
\stick{over, that as we shall all of us conti-}\catch{nue}
\stick{nue to be great wits,\tsk we should never} 
\stick{agree amongst ourselves, one day to an} 
\stick{end:\tsh there would be so much satire} 
\stick{and sarcasm,\tsh scoffing and flouting,}
\stick{with raillying and reparteeing of it,\tsh}
\stick{thrusting and parrying in one corner or} 
\stick{another,\tsh there would be nothing but} 
\stick{mischief among us.\tsk Chaste stars! what}
\stick{biting and scratching, and what a racket}
\stick{and a clatter we should make, what with}
\stick{breaking of heads, and rapping of} 
\stick{knuckles, and hitting of sore places,\tsk} 
\stick{there would be no such thing as living} 
for us.

But then again, as we should all of us
\stick{be men of great judgment, we should}
\stick{make up matters as fast as ever they went}
\stick{wrong; and though we should abominate}
\stick{each other, ten times worse than so many}
\stick{devils or devilesses, we should neverthe-}
\stick{less, my dear creatures, be all courtesy}\catch{and} 
and kindness,\tsk\!\tsk milk and honey,\tsh ’twould be a
second land of promise,\tsh\break
a paradise upon earth, if there was
such a thing to be had,\tsk so that upon the whole we should have
done well enough.

All I fret and fume at, and what most 
\stck{distresses my invention at present, is how}
to bring the point itself to bear; for as your
worships well know, that of these 
\stck{heavenly emanations of \textit{wit} and \textit{judgment},} 
which I have so bountifully wished both for your
worships and myself,\tsk there is\break
\stick{but a certain \textit{quantum} stored up for us all,}
for the use and behoof of the whole race of
mankind; and such small \textit{modicums} of ’em are only sent forth
into this wide world, circulating here and there in one by corner
or another,\tsk and in such narrow streams, and at such prodigious
intervals from each other, that one would\catch{wonder} wonder how it holds out,
or could be sufficient for the wants and emergencies of so many
great estates, and populous empires.

Indeed there is one thing to be consi-
\stick{dered, that in \textit{Nova Zembla}, \textit{North Lap}-}
\stick{\textit{land}, and in all those cold and dreary} 
\stick{tracts of the globe, which lie more di-}
\stick{rectly under the arctick and antartick cir-}
\stick{cles,\tsh where the whole province of a} 
\stick{man’s concernments lies for near nine}
\stick{months together, within the narrow com-}
\stick{pass of his cave,\tsk\!\tsk where the spirits are} 
\stick{compressed almost to nothing,\tsk\!\tsk and} 
\stck{where the passions of a man, with every}
\stick{thing which belongs to them, are as frigid}
\stick{as the zone itself;\tsk there the least quan-}
\stck{tity of \textit{judgment} imaginable does the busi-}
\stick{ness,\tsk and of \textit{wit},\tsk there is a total and} 
\stick{an absolute saving,\tsk for as not one spark}\catch{is}
\stick{is wanted,\tsk so not one spark is given.} 
\stick{Angels and ministers of grace defend us!}
\stck{What a dismal thing would it have been to}
\stick{have governed a kingdom, to have fought}
\stick{a battle, or made a treaty, or run a match,} 
\stick{or wrote a book, or got a child, or held a} 
\stck{provincial chapter there, with so \textit{plentiful a}}
\stick{\textit{lack} of wit and judgment about~us! for}
\stick{mercy’s sake! let us think no more about} 
\stick{it, but travel on as fast as we can south-}
\stick{wards into \textit{Norway},\tsk crossing over}
\stick{\textit{Swedeland}, if you please, through the}
\stick{small triangular province of \textit{Angermania}} 
\stick{to the lake of \textit{Bothnia}; coasting along it}
\stick{through east and west \textit{Bothnia}, down to}
\stck{\textit{Carelia}, and so on, through all those states}
\stick{and provinces which border upon the far} 
\stick{side of the \textit{Gulf} of \textit{Finland}, and the north}
\stick{east of the \textit{Baltick}, up to \textit{Petersbourg}, and}
\stick{just stepping into \textit{Ingria};\tsh then}
\stick{stretching over directly from thence}\catch{through}
\stick{through the north parts of the \textit{Russian}} 
\stick{empire,\tsk leaving \textit{Siberia} a little upon the}
\stick{left hand till we got into the very heart of} 
\textit{Russian} and \textit{Asiatick Tartary}.

Now throughout this long tour which
\stick{I have led you, you observe the good} 
\stick{people are better off by far, than in the} 
\stick{polar countries which we have just left:}
\stick{\tsk for if you hold your hand over your}
\stick{eyes, and look very attentively, your may}\rlap{\quad\club}
\stick{perceive some small glimmerings (as it}
\stick{were) of wit, with a comfortable provi-}
\stick{sion of good plain \textit{houshold} judgment,} 
\stick{which taking the quality and quantity of} 
\stick{it together, they make a very good shift}
\stick{with,\tsk and had they more of either the}
\stick{one or the other, it would destroy the} 
\stick{proper ballance betwixt them, and I am} 
\stck{satisfied moreover they would want occa-}
sions to put them to use.\patch{Now,}

Now, Sir, if I conduct you home \break
\stick{again into this warmer and more luxuri-}
\stick{ant island, where you perceive the spring}
\stick{tide of our blood and humours runs high,}
\stick{\tsh where we have more ambition, and} 
\stick{pride, and envy, and lechery, and other} 
\stck{whoreson passions upon our hands to go-}
\stick{vern and subject to reason,\tsk the \textit{height} of}
\stick{our wit and the \textit{depth} of our judgment,} 
\stick{you see, are exactly proportioned to the} 
\stck{\textit{length} and \textit{breadth} of our necessities,\tsk and}
\stick{accordingly, we have them sent down}
\stick{amongst us in such a flowing kind of de-}
\stick{cent and creditable plenty, that no one} 
thinks he has any cause to complain.

It must however be confessed on this
\stick{head, that, as our air blows hot and cold,}
\stick{\tsh wet and dry, ten times in a day, we} 
\stick{have them in no regular and settled way;}
\stick{\tsh so that sometimes for near half a}\catch{century} 
\stick{century together, there shall be very little}
\stick{wit or judgment either to be seen or} 
\stick{heard of amongst us:\tsk the small chan-}
\stick{nels of them shall seem quite dried up,\tsk}
\stck{then all of a sudden the sluices shall break}
\stick{out, and take a fit of running again like} 
\stick{fury,\tsh you would think they would ne-}
\stick{ver stop:\tsh and then it is, that in writ-}
\stick{ing and fighting, and twenty other gal-}
\stick{lant things, we drive all the world be-}
fore us.

It is by these observations, and a wary
\stick{reasoning by analogy in that kind of ar-}
\stick{gumentative process, which \textit{Suidas} calls}
\stick{\textit{dialectick induction},\tsk that I draw and set} 
\stick{up this position as most true and veri-}
table.

That of these two luminaries, so much 
\stick{of their irradiations are suffered from}\catch{time}
\stick{time to time to shine down upon us; as}
\stk{he, whose infinite wisdom which dispenses}
\stick{every thing in exact weight and measure,} 
\stick{knows will just serve to light us on our}
\stick{way in this night of our obscurity; so} 
\stick{that your reverences and worships now} 
\stick{find out, nor is it a moment longer in my}
\stick{power to conceal it from you, That the} 
\stick{fervent wish in your behalf with which I} 
\stick{set out, was no more than the first insi-}
\stick{nuating \textit{How d’ye} of a caressing prefacer} 
\stick{stifling his reader, as a lover sometimes} 
\stick{does a coy mistress into silence. For alas!}
\stick{could this effusion of light have been as}
\stick{easily procured, as the exordium wished} 
\stick{it\tsk I tremble to think how many thou-}
\stick{sands for it, of benighted travellers (in}
\stick{the learned sciences at least) must have}
\stick{groped and blundered on in the dark, all} 
\stick{the nights of their lives,\tsh running their} 
\stick{heads against posts, and knocking out}\catch{their}
\stick{their brains without ever getting to their}
\stick{journies end;\tsk some falling with their} 
\stck{noses perpendicularly into stinks,\tsk others}
\stick{horizontally with their tails into kennels.}
\stick{Here one half of a learned profession tilt-}
\stick{ing full butt against the other half of it,}
\stick{and then tumbling and rolling one over} 
\stick{the other in the dirt like hogs.\tsk Here}
\stick{the brethren, of another profession, who} 
\stick{should have run in opposition to each} 
\stick{other, flying on the contrary like a flock}
\stick{of wild geese, all in a row the same way.}
\stick{\tsk What confusion!\tsk what mistakes!}
\stick{\tsh fiddlers and painters judging by their}
\stick{eyes and ears,\tsk admirable!\tsk trusting to}
\stick{the passions excited in an air sung, or a} 
\stick{story painted to the heart,\tsk instead of} 
measuring them by a quadrant.

In the foreground of this picture, a\break
\stick{\textit{statesman} turning the political wheel, like}\catch{a brute,} 
\stick{a brute, the wrong way round\tsk \textit{against}} 
\stick{the stream of corruption,\tsk by heaven!\tsk}
instead of \textit{with} it.

In this corner, a son of the divine\break
\stick{\textit{Esculapius}, writing a book against pre-}
\stick{destination; perhaps worse,\tsk feeling his}
\stck{patient’s pulse, instead of his apothecary’s}
\stick{\tsk a brother of the faculty in the back} 
\stck{ground upon his knees in tears,\tsk drawing}
\stick{the curtains of a mangled victim to beg} 
\stick{his forgiveness;\tsk offering a fee,\tsk instead} 
of taking one.


\tight{In that spacious \textsc{hall}, a coalition of the}\break

\stick{them, with all their might and main, the}\rlap{\quad\club}

\stick{great doors, instead of, \textit{in},\tsh and with} 
\stick{such fury in their looks, and such a de-}\catch{gree}
\stick{gree of inveteracy in their manner of}
\stick{kicking it, as if the laws had been origi-}
\stck{nally made for the peace and preservation}
\stick{of mankind:\tsk perhaps a more enormous} 
\stick{mistake committed by them still,\tsk a li-}

\stick{could stand in \textit{Tom o’\thinspace Stiles} his face, with-}
\stick{out a trespass, or not,\tsk rashly determin-}
\stick{ed by them in five and twenty minutes,}
\stick{which, with the cautious pro’s and con’s} 
\stick{required in so intricate a proceeding,}
\stick{might have taken up as many months,\tsk} 
\stick{and if carried on upon a military plan, as} 
\stck{your honours know, an \textsc{action} should be,}

\stick{all advantages on both sides,\tsh might}\catch{rea-}
\stick{reasonably have lasted them as many}
\stick{years, finding food and raiment all that}
\stick{term for a centumvirate of the profes-}
sion.


As for the clergy\tsh\!\tsh No\tsh If
\stick{I say a word against them, I’ll be shot.\tsk}
\stick{I have no desire,\tsk and besides, if I had,}
\stick{\tsh I durst not for my soul touch upon} 
\stick{the subject,\tsh with such weak nerves} 
\stick{and spirits, and in the condition I am in}
\stick{at present, ’twould be as much as my life} 
\stick{\stick{was worth, to deject and contrist my-}} 
\stick{self with so sad and melancholy an ac-}
\stick{count,\tsk and therefore, ’tis safer to draw}
\stick{a curtain across, and hasten from it, as} 
\stick{fast as I can, to the main and principal} 
\stick{point I have undertaken to clear up,\tsh} 
\stick{and that is, How it comes to pass, that} 
\stick{your men of least \textit{wit} are reported to be} 
\stick{men of most \textit{judgment}.\tsh But mark,\tsk}\catch{I say,}
\stick{I say, \textit{reported to be},\tsk for it is no more,}
\stick{my dear Sirs, than a report, and which}
\stick{like twenty others taken up every}
\stick{day upon trust, I maintain to be a vile}
\stick{and a malicious report into the bar-}
gain.

\tight{This by the help of the observations al-}
\stck{ready premised, and I hope already weigh-}
\stck{ed and perpended by your reverences and}
\stick{worships, I shall forthwith make ap-}
pear.

I hate set dessertations,\tsh and above
\stick{all things in the world, ’tis one of the sil-}
\stick{liest things in one of them, to darken} 
\stick{your hypothesis by placing a number of} 
\stick{tall, opake words, one before another, in} 
\stick{a right line, betwixt your own and your}
\stick{reader’s conception,\tsh when in all like-}
\stick{lihood, if you had looked about you,}\catch{might} 
\stick{might have seen something standing, or}
\stick{hanging up, which would have cleared}
\stick{the point at once,\tsk \lqq for what hinde-}
\stick{\lqq rance, hurt or harm, doth the laudable}
\stick{\lqq desire of knowledge bring to any man,}
\stick{\lqq if even from a sot, a pot, a fool, a stool, a}
\stick{\lqq winter-mittain, a truckle for a pully,}
\stick{\lqq the lid of a goldsmith’s crucible, an oyl}
\stick{\lqq bottle, an old slipper, or a cane chair,”}
\stick{\tsk I am this moment sitting upon one.} 
\stick{Will you give me leave to illustrate this}
\stick{affair of wit and judgment, by the two} 
\stick{knobs on the top of the back of it,\tsh}
\stick{they are fasten’d on, you see, with two}
\stick{pegs stuck slightly into two gimlet-holes,} 
\stick{and will place what I have to say in so} 
\stick{clear a light, as to let you see through the} 
\stick{drift and meaning of my whole preface,} 
\stick{as plainly as if every point and particle}
of it was made up of sun beams.\patch{I enter}

I enter now directly upon the point.

\tsh Here stands \textit{wit},\tsh and there
\stick{stands \textit{judgment}, close beside it, just like}
\stick{the two knobbs I’m speaking of, upon} 
\stick{the back of this self same chair on which}
I am sitting.

\tsh You see, they are the highest and
\stick{most ornamental parts of its \textit{frame},\tsh as}
\stick{wit and judgment are of \textit{ours},\tsh and} 
\stick{like them too, indubitably both made}
\stick{and fitted to go together, in order, as we}
\stick{say in all such cases of duplicated embel-}
lishments,\tsh \textit{to answer one another}.

\tight{Now for the sake of an experiment, and}
\stick{for the clearer illustrating this matter,\tsk} 
\stick{let us for a moment, take off one of these}
\stick{two curious ornaments (I care not which)} 
\stick{from the point or pinnacle of the chair it}\catch{now}
\stick{now stands on;\tsh nay, don’t laugh at}
\stick{it.\tsh But did you ever see in the whole}
\stick{course of your lives, such a ridiculous bu-}
\stick{siness as this has made of it?\tsh Why,}
\stick{’tis as miserable a sight as a sow with one}
\stick{ear; and there is just as much sense and}
\stick{symmetry in the one, as in the other:\tsk} 
\stick{do,\tsk pray, get off your seats, only to}
\stick{take a view of it.\tsh Now would any}
\stick{man who valued his character a straw,} 
\stick{have turned a piece of work out of his}
\stick{hand in such a condition?\tsk nay, lay} 
\stck{your hands upon your hearts, and answer} 
\stick{this plain question, Whether this one sin-}
\stick{gle knobb, which now stands here like a} 
\stick{blockhead by itself, can serve any pur-}
\stick{pose upon earth, but to put one in mind}
\stick{of the want of the other;\tsh and let me} 
\stick{further ask, in case the chair was your}
\stick{own, if you would not in your consci-}
\stick{ences think, rather than be as it is, that}\catch{it} 
\stick{it  would be ten times better without any}
knobb at all.

Now these two knobs\tsh or top or-
\stck{naments of the mind of man, which crown}
\stick{the whole entablature,\tsk being, as I said,}
\stick{wit and judgment, which of all others, as} 
\stick{I have proved it, are the most needful,\tsh}
\stick{the most priz’d,\tsh the most calami-}
\stick{tous to be without, and consequently the}
\stick{hardest to come at,\tsk for all these rea-}
\stick{sons put together, there is not a mor-}
\stick{tal amongst us, so destitute of a love of}
\stick{good fame or feeding,\tsh or so ignorant} 
\stick{of what will do him good therein,\tsk who}
\stck{does not wish and stedfastly resolve in his}
\stick{own mind, to be, or to be thought at} 
\stick{least master of the one or the other, and}
\stick{indeed of both of them, if the thing} 
\stick{seems any way feasible, or likely to be}
brought to pass.\patch{Now}

Now your graver gentry having little
\stick{or no kind of chance in aiming at the}
\stick{one,\tsk unless they laid hold of the other,}
\stick{\tsh pray what do you think would be-}
\stick{come of them?\tsk Why, Sirs, in spight} 
\stick{of all their \textit{gravities}, they must e’en have} 
\stick{been contented to have gone with their}
\stick{insides naked:\tsk this was not to be borne,}
\stick{but by an effort of philosophy not to be}
\stick{supposed in the case we are upon,\tsh so}
\stick{that no one could well have been angry}
\stick{with them, had they been satisfied with}
\stick{what little they could have snatched up}
\stick{and secreted under their cloaks and great}
\stick{perrywigs, had they not raised a \textit{hue} and}
\stick{\textit{cry} at the same time against the lawful}
owners.

I need not tell your worships, that this
\stick{was done with so much cunning and arti-} 
\stick{fice,\tsk that the great \textit{Locke}, who was sel-}\catch{dom}
\stick{dom outwitted by false sounds,\tsk was}
\stick{nevertheless bubbled here. The cry, it}
\stick{seems, was so deep and solemn a one,} 
\stick{and what with the help of great wigs,}
\stick{grave faces, and other implements of de-}
\stck{ceit, was rendered so general a one against}
\stick{the \textit{poor wits} in this matter, that the phi-}
\stick{losopher himself was deceived by it,\tsk it} 
\stick{was his glory to free the world from the}
\stick{lumber of a thousand vulgar errors;\tsh}
\stick{but this was not of the number; so that}
\stick{instead of sitting down cooly, as such a}
\stick{philosopher should have done, to have}
\stick{examined the matter of fact before he}
\stick{philosophised upon it;\tsk on the contra-}
\stick{ry he took the fact for granted, and so}
\stick{joined in with the cry, and halloo’d it as}
boisterously as the rest.

This has been made the \textit{Magna Charta} 
\stick{of stupidity ever since,\tsh but your reve-}\catch{rences} 
\stick{rences plainly see, it has been obtained in}
\stick{such a manner, that the title to it is not}
\stick{worth a groat; \tsh which by the bye is}
\stick{one of the many and vile impositions} 
\stick{which gravity and grave folks have to an-}
swer for hereafter.

As for great wigs, upon which I may 
\stick{be thought to have spoken my mind too}
\stick{freely,\tsh I beg leave to qualify what-}
\stick{ever has been unguardedly said to their}
\stick{dispraise or prejudice, by one general de-}
\stick{claration\tsk That I have no abhorrence}
\stck{whatever, nor do I detest and abjure either}
\stick{great wigs or long beards,\tsk any further}
\stick{than when I see they are bespoke and let}
\stck{grow on purpose to carry on this self-same}
\stick{imposture\tsk for any purpose,\tsk peace}
\stick{be with them;\tsk ☞ mark only,\tsk I} 
write not for them.\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

\dropcap{W}{hen} corporal \textit{Trim} had brought
his two mortars to bear, he was delighted with his handy-work
above\break
measure; and knowing what a pleasure it would be to his master to
see them, he was not able to resist the desire he had of carrying
them directly into his parlour.

Now next to the moral lesson I had in view in mentioning the
affair of \textit{hinges}, I had a speculative consideration arising
out of it, and it is this.

Had the parlour-door open’d and\break

\tsk Or for example, as cleverly as our government has been
turning upon its hinges,\tsh (that is, in case things have all

to master or man, in corporal \textit{Trim}’s peeping in: the
moment, he had beheld my father and my uncle \textit{Toby} fast

for the many years in which this hinge was suffered to be out of
order, and amongst the hourly grievances my father submitted to
upon its account,\tsk this was one; that he never folded his
arms to take his nap after dinner, but the thoughts of be-\catch{ing}

\dropcap{T}{ho}’ the shock my uncle \textit{Toby} re-\break
ceived the year after the demoli-\break
tion of \textit{Dunkirk}, in his affair with widow \textit{Wadman}, had fixed
him in a resolution never more to think of the sex,\tsk or of
aught which belonged to it;\tsk yet corporal \textit{Trim} had made
no such bargain with himself. Indeed in my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s case there was a strange and unaccountable
concurrence of circumstances which in-\catch{sensibly} 
sensibly drew him in, to lay siege to that\break
fair and strong citadel.\tsh In \textit{Trim}’s case\break
there was a concurrence of nothing in the\break
world, but of him and \textit{Bridget} in the\break
kitchen;\tsk though in truth, the love and\break
veneration he bore his master was such,\break
and so fond was he of imitating him in\break
all he did, that had my uncle \textit{Toby} em-\break
ployed his time and genius in tagging of\break
points,\tsh I am persuaded the honest\break
corporal would laid\sic\ down his arms, and\break
followed his example with pleasure.\break
When therefore my uncle \textit{Toby} sat down\break
before the mistress,\tsk corporal \textit{Trim} in-\break
continently took ground before the maid.

Now, my dear friend \textit{Garrick}, whom 
\stick{I have so much cause to esteem and ho-}
\stick{nour,\tsk (why, or wherefore, ’tis no mat-}
\stick{ter)\tsk can it escape your penetration,\tsk I}
\stick{defy it,\tsk that so many play-wrights, and}\catch{opificers}
\stick{opificers of chit chat have ever since been} 
\stick{\stck{working upon \textit{Trim}’s and my uncle \textit{Toby}’s}}
\stick{pattern.\tsh I care not what \textit{Aristotle}, or} 
\stick{\textit{Pacuvius}, or \textit{Bossu}, or \textit{Ricaboni} say,\tsk} 
\stick{(though I never read one of them)\tsh} 
\stick{there is not a greater difference between}
\stick{a single-horse chair and madam \textit{Pompa}-}
\stick{\textit{dour}’s \textit{vis} a \textit{vis}, than betwixt a single}
\stick{amour, and an amour thus nobly dou-}
\stick{bled, and going upon all four, prancing} 
\stick{throughout a grand drama.\tsk Sir, a sim-}
\stick{ple, single, silly affair of that kind,\tsh} 
\stick{is quite lost in five acts,\tsh but that is}
neither here nor there.

\tight{After a series of attacks and repulses in}
\stick{a course of nine months on my uncle \textit{To}-}
\stick{\textit{by}’s quarter, a most minute account of}
\stick{every particular of which shall be given}
\stick{in its proper place, my uncle \textit{Toby}, ho-}
\stick{nest man! found it necessary to draw off}\catch{his} 
\stick{his forces, and raise the siege somewhat}
indignantly.


Corporal \textit{Trim}, as I said, had made no
\stick{such bargain either with himself\tsh or} 
\stick{with any one else,\tsh the fidelity however} 
\stick{of his heart not suffering him to go into a}
\stck{house which his master had forsaken with} 
\stick{disgust,\tsh he contented himself with}
\stick{turning his part of the siege into a block-}
\stick{ade;\tsk that is, he kept others off,\tsk}
\stick{for though he never after went to the} 
\stick{house, yet he never met \textit{Bridget} in the vil-}
\stick{lage, but he would either nod or wink,} 
\stick{or smile, or look kindly at her,\tsk or (as}
\stick{circumstances directed), he would shake} 
\stick{her by the hand,\tsk or ask her lovingly} 
\stick{how she did,\tsk or would give her a rib-}
\stick{ban,\tsk and now and then, though ne-}
\stick{ver but when it could be done with de-}
corum, would give \textit{Bridget} a \tsh\patch{Pre-}

Precisely in this situation, did these
\stick{things stand for five years; that is, from} 
\stick{the demolition of \textit{Dunkirk} in the year 13,} 
\stick{to the latter end of my uncle \textit{Toby}’s cam-}
\stick{paign in the year 18, which was about six} 
\stck{or seven weeks before the time I’m speak-}
\stick{ing of.\tsk When \textit{Trim}, as his custom was,}
\stick{after he had put my uncle \textit{Toby} to bed,} 
\stick{going down one moon-shiny night to see} 
\stick{that every thing was right at his fortifica-}
\stick{tions,\tsh in the lane separated from the}
\stck{bowling-green with flowering shrubs and} 
holly,\tsk he espied his \textit{Bridget}.

As the corporal thought there was no\-thing in the world so well
worth shewing as the glorious works which he and my uncle
\textit{Toby} had made, \textit{Trim} courteous\-ly and gallantly took
her by the hand, and led her in: this was not done so private\-ly,
but that the foul-mouth’d trumpet of\catch{Fame}
Fame carried it from ear to ear, till at length it reached my
father’s, with this untoward circumstance along with it,\break
\stck{that my uncle \textit{Toby}’s curious draw-bridge,} constructed and
painted after the \textit{Dutch} fashion, and which went quite
across the ditch,\tsk was broke down, and some how or other
crush’d all to pieces that very night.

My father, as you have observed, had no great esteem for my
uncle \textit{Toby}’s\break hobby-horse,\tsk he thought it the most
ri-\break
\stck{diculous horse that ever gentleman mount-}
ed; and indeed unless my
uncle \textit{Toby} vexed him about it, could never think of it once,
without smiling at it,\tsh so that it could never get lame
or happen any mischance, but it tickled my father’s
imagination beyond measure; but this being an accident much more to
his hu-\catch{mour}
\stck{mour than any one which had yet befall’n} 
\stick{it, it proved an inexhaustible fund of en-}
\stick{tertainment to him,\tsh Well,\tsh but}
\stick{dear \textit{Toby!} my father would say, do tell} 
\stick{us seriously how this affair of the bridge}
\stick{happened.\tsh How can you teaze me so} 
\stick{much about it? my uncle \textit{Toby} would}
\stick{reply,\tsk I have told it you twenty times,}
\stick{word for word as \textit{Trim} told it me.\tsk Pri-}
\stick{thee, how was it then, corporal? my fa-}
\stick{ther would cry, turning to \textit{Trim.}\tsk It was}
\stick{a mere misfortune, an’ please your ho-}
\stick{nour,\tsk I was shewing Mrs.\@ \textit{Bridget}}
\stick{our fortifications, and in going too near} 
\stick{the edge of the fossè, I unfortunately}
\stick{slip’d in.\tsk Very well, \textit{Trim!}\@ my father} 
\stick{would cry,\tsk (smiling mysteriously, and}
\stick{giving a nod,\tsh but without inter-}
\stick{rupting him)\tsh and being link’d}
\stick{fast, an’ please your honour, arm in arm} 
\stick{with Mrs.\@ \textit{Bridget}, I dragg’d her after}\catch{me,} 
\stck{me, by means of which she fell backwards}
soss against the bridge,\tsh and \textit{Trim}’s
foot (my uncle \textit{Toby} would cry, taking the story out of
his mouth) getting into the cuvette, he tumbled full against the
bridge too.\tsk It was a thousand to one, my uncle \textit{Toby}
would add, that the poor 
\stick{fellow did not break his leg.\tsh Ay truly!}
my father would say,\tsh a limb is soon broke, brother
\textit{Toby}, in such encounters.\break
\tsh And so, an’ please your honour, the bridge, which your
honour knows was a very slight one, was broke down betwixt us,
and splintered all to pieces.

At other times, but especially when 
\stck{my uncle \textit{Toby} was so unfortunate as to say}
\stick{a syllable about cannons, bombs, or pe-}
\stick{tards,\tsk my father would exhaust all the} 
\stick{stores of his eloquence (which indeed}
\stick{were very great) in a panegyric upon the}\catch{\textscl{bat-}}
\textscl{battering-rams} of the ancients,\tsk the 
\stck{\textscl{vinea} which \textit{Alexander} made use of at the}
\stick{siege of \textit{Tyre}.\tsk He would tell my uncle}
\stick{\textit{Toby} of the \textscl{catapultæ} of the \textit{Syrians}}
\stick{\tighter{which threw such monstrous stones so ma-}}
\stick{ny hundred feet, and shook the strongest}
\stick{\tight{bulwarks from their very foundation;\tsk he}}
would go on and
describe the wonderful mechanism of the \textscl{ballista}, which
\textit{Mar\-cellinus} makes so much rout about,\tsk the terrible
effects of the \textscl{pyraboli},\tsk which cast fire,\tsk the
danger of the \textscl{terebra} and \textscl{scorpio}, which cast
javelins.\tsh But what are these, he would say, to the
destructive machinery of corporal \textit{Trim?}\tsk
Believe me, brother \textit{Toby}, no bridge, or bastion, or
sally port that ever was con-
\stck{structed in this world, can hold out against}
such artillery.

My uncle \textit{Toby} would never attempt\catch{any}
\stick{any defence against the force of this ridi-}
\stick{cule, but that of redoubling the vehe-}
\stick{mence of smoaking his pipe; in doing} 
\stick{which, he raised so dense a vapour one}
\stick{night after supper, that it set my father,} 
\stick{who was a little phthisical, into a suf-}
\stick{focating fit of violent coughing: my}
\stick{uncle \textit{Toby} leap’d up without feeling the} 
\stick{pain upon his groin,\tsk and, with infinite}
\stick{pity, stood beside his brother’s chair, tap-}
\stick{ping his back with one hand, and hold-}
\stick{ing his head with the other, and from} 
\stick{time to time, wiping his eyes with a clean} 
\stick{cambrick handkerchief, which he pull’d} 
\stick{out of his pocket.\tsh The affectionate} 
\stick{and endearing manner in which my} 
\stick{uncle \textit{Toby} did these little offices,\tsk cut}
\stick{my father thro’ his reins, for the pain he} 
\stick{had just been giving him.\tsh May my}
\stick{brains be knock’d out with a battering} 
\stick{ram or a catapulta, I care not which,}\catch{quoth}
\stick{quoth my father to himself,\tsh if ever}
I insult this worthy soul more.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXV.}

\dropcap{T}{he} draw-bridge being held
irrepa\-rable, \textit{Trim} was ordered directly\break 
\stick{to set about another,\tsh but not upon the} 
\stick{same model; for cardinal \textit{Alberoni}’s in-}
\stick{trigues at that time being discovered,}
\stick{and my uncle \textit{Toby} rightly foreseeing that}
\stick{a flame would inevitably break out be-}
\stick{twixt \textit{Spain} and the Empire, and that the}
\stick{operations of the ensuing campaign must}
\stick{in all likelihood be either in \textit{Naples} or}
\stick{\textit{Sicily},\tsh he determined upon an \textit{Italian}}
\stick{bridge,\tsk (my uncle \textit{Toby}, by the bye,} 
\stick{was not far out of his conjectures)\tsh}
\stick{but my father, who was infinitely the}
\stick{better politician, and took the lead as far}
\stick{of my uncle \textit{Toby} in the cabinet, as my}\catch{uncle} 
\stick{uncle \textit{Toby} took it of him in the field,\tsh}
\stick{convinced him, that if the King of \textit{Spain}}
\stick{and the Emperor went together by the}
\stick{ears, that \textit{England} and \textit{France} and \textit{Hol}-}
\stick{\textit{land} must, by force of their pre-engage-}
\stick{ments, all enter the lists too;\tsh and if} 
\stick{so, he would say, the combatants, bro-}
\stick{ther \textit{Toby}, as sure as we are alive, will}
\stick{fall to it again, pell-mell, upon the old}
\stick{prize-fighting stage of \textit{Flanders};\tsk then}
\tight{what will you do with your \textit{Italian} bridge?}

\tsk We will go on with it then, upon the old model, cried my
uncle \textit{Toby}.

When corporal \textit{Trim} had about half finished it in that
stile,\tsh my uncle \textit{Toby} found out a capital defect in
it, which he had never thoroughly considered before. It turned,
it seems, upon hinges at both ends of it, opening in the middle,
one\catch{half} 
\stick{half of which turning to one side of the} 
\stick{fossè, and the other, to the other; the ad-}
\stick{vantage of which was this, that by divid-}
\stick{ing the weight of the bridge into two} 
\stick{equal portions, it impowered my uncle} 
\stick{\textit{Toby} to raise it up or let it down with the}
\stick{end of his crutch, and with one hand,} 
\stick{which, as his garrison was weak, was as} 
\stick{much as he could well spare,\tsk but the} 
\stck{disadvantages of such a construction were}
\stick{insurmountable,\tsh for by this means,}
\stick{he would say, I leave one half of my} 
\stick{bridge in my enemy’s possession,\tsh and}
pray of what use is the other?

The natural remedy for this, was no 
\stick{doubt to have his bridge fast only at one} 
\stick{end with hinges, so that the whole might} 
\stick{be lifted up together, and stand bolt up-}
\stick{right,\tsh but that was rejected for the}
reason given above.\patch{For}

For a whole week after he was deter-
\stick{mined in his mind to have one of that}
\stick{particular construction which is made} 
\stick{to draw back horizontally, to hinder a}
\stick{passage; and to thrust forwards again to}
\stick{gain a passage,\tsh of which sorts your} 
\stick{worship might have seen three famous}
\stck{ones at \textit{Spires} before its destruction,\tsk and}
\stick{one now at \textit{Brisac}, if I mistake not;\tsh}
\stick{but my father advising my uncle \textit{Toby},} 
\stick{with great earnestness, to have nothing}
\stick{more to do with thrusting bridges,\tsk and}
\stick{my uncle foreseeing moreover that it}
\stick{would but perpetuate the memory of the}
\stick{corporal’s misfortune,\tsk he changed his} 
\stick{mind for that of the marquis \textit{d}’\textit{Hôpital}’s} 
\stick{invention, which the younger \textit{Bernouilli}}
\stk{has so well and learnedly described, as your}
\stick{worships may see,\tsh \textit{Act.\@ Erud.\@ Lips.\@} an.}
\stick{1695,\tsk to these a lead weight is an eter-}
\stick{nal ballance, and keeps watch as well as a}\catch{couple}
\stick{couple of centinels, inasmuch as the con-}
\stick{struction of them was a curve-line ap-}
\stick{proximating to a cycloid,\tsh if not a cy-}
cloid itself.

My uncle \textit{Toby} understood the nature 
\stick{of a parabola as well as any man in \textit{Eng}-}
\stick{\textit{land}\tsk but was not quite such a master of}
\stick{the cycloid;\tsk he talked however about it}

\dropcap{\Usk{18pt}I}{won\lower2pt\hbox{’}t} go about to argue the\break
point with you,\tsk ’tis so,\tsk and\catch{I am}
I am persuaded of it, madam, as much\break
as can be, \lqq That both man and woman\break
\lqq bear pain or sorrow, (and, for aught I\break
\lqq know, pleasure too) best in a horizon-\break
\lqq tal position.\,”

The moment my father got up into 
\stick{his chamber, he threw himself prostrate} 
\stck{across his bed in the wildest disorder ima-}
\stick{ginable, but at the same time in the most}
\stick{lamentable attitude of a man borne down} 
\stick{with sorrows, that ever the eye of pity} 
\stick{dropp’d a tear for.\tsh The palm of his} 
\stick{right hand, as he fell upon the bed, re-}
\stick{ceiving his forehead, and covering the}
\stick{greatest part of both his eyes, gently sunk} 
\stick{down with his head (his elbow giving} 
\stick{way backwards) till his nose touch’d the} 
\stick{quilt;\tsh his left arm hung insensible} 
\stick{over the side of the bed, his knuckles re-}
\stick{clining upon the handle of the chamber}\catch{pot,}
\stick{pot, which peep’d out beyond the va-}
\stick{lance,\tsk his right leg (his left being}
\stick{drawn up towards his body) hung half}
\stick{over the side of the bed, the edge of it} 
\stick{pressing upon his shin-bone.\tsh He felt}
\stick{it not. A fix’d, inflexible sorrow took}
\stick{possession of every line of his face.\tsk He} 
\stick{sigh’d once,\tsk heaved his breast often,\tsk}
but utter’d not a word.

An old set-stitch’d chair, valanced and 
\stick{fringed around with party-colour’d wor-}
\stick{sted bobs, stood at the bed’s head, oppo-}
\stick{site to the side where my father’s head re-}
\stick{clined.\tsk My uncle \textit{Toby} sat him down}
in it.

Before an affliction is digested,\tsh\break
\stick{consolation ever comes too soon;\tsk and} 
\stick{after it is digested,\tsk it comes too late:}
\stick{so that you see, madam, there is but a}\catch{mark}
mark between these two, as fine almost as a hair, for a
comforter to take aim at: my uncle \textit{Toby} was always
either on this
\stick{side, or on that of it, and would often say,}\break
He believed in his heart, he could as soon hit the longitude;
for this reason, when he sat down in the chair, he drew the
cur-tain a little forwards, and having a tear at every one’s
service,\tsk he pull’d out\break a cambrick handkerchief,\tsh gave a
low sigh,\tsh but held his peace.

\textit{is not
gain that is got in-\break to the purse}.”\tsk So that\break
notwithstanding my father had the happiness of reading the
oddest books in the universe, and had moreover, in himself, the
oddest way of thinking, that ever\catch{man} man in it was bless’d with, yet
it had this drawback upon him after all,\tsh that it laid him
open to some of the oddest and most whimsical distresses; of
which this particular one which he sunk under at present is as
strong an example as can be given.

No doubt, the breaking down of the bridge of a child’s
nose, by the edge of a pair of forceps,\tsk however scientifically
applied,\tsk would vex any man in the world, who was at so much
pains in begetting a child, as my father was,\tsk yet it will not
account for the extravagance of his affliction, or\sic\ will it justify
the unchristian manner he abandoned and surrender’d himself up
to.

To explain this, I must leave him upon\catch{the} the bed for half an
hour,\tsh and my good uncle \textit{Toby} in his old fringed
chair sitting beside him.

\null
\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXXI.}

\initial{\Usk{20pt}I}{\lss{THINK}} it a very unreason\-able
demand,\tsk cried my great\break
grandfather, twisting up the paper,
and throwing it upon the table.\tsh By this account, madam, you
have but two thou\-sand pounds fortune, and not a shilling
more,\tsh and you insist upon having three hundred pounds a year
jointure for\break it,\tsk

\tsk \lqq Because,” replied my great-grand-\break
mother, \lqq you have little or no nose,\break
\lqq Sir.”\tsh

Now, before I venture to make use\catch{of}
of the word \textit{Nose} a
second time,\tsk to avoid all confusion in what will be said upon
it, in this interesting part of my story, it may not be amiss to
explain my own meaning, and define, with all possible exactness and
precision, what I would willingly be understood to mean by the
term: being of opinion, that ’tis owing\break to the negligence and
perverseness of writers in despising this precaution, and to
nothing else,\tsh
That all the polemi\-cal writings in divinity, are not as clear
\stick{and demonstrative as those upon \textit{a Will o’}}
\textit{the Wisp}, or any
other sound part of phi\-losophy, and natural pursuit; in order to
which, what have you to do, before you set out, unless you
intend to go puzzling on to the day of judgment,\tsh but
to\break
give the world a good definition, and stand to it, of the main
word you have most occasion for,\tsh changing it, Sir, as\catch{you}
you would a guinea, into small coin?\tsk which done,\tsk let the
father of confusion puzzle you, if he can; or put a different
idea either into your head, or your reader’s head, if he knows
how.

In books of strict morality and close reasoning, such as this I am
engaged\break in,\tsk the neglect is inexcusable; and hea\-ven is witness,
how the world has re\-venged itself upon me for leaving so many
openings to equivocal strictures,\tsk and for depending so much as
I have done, all along, upon the cleanliness of my reader’s
imaginations.

\tsh Here are two senses, cried \textit{Eu\-genius}, as we walk’d
along, pointing with the fore finger of his right hand to the
word \textit{Crevice}, in the fifty-second page of the second
volume of this book of books,\catch{\tsk here}
\tsh here are two senses,\tsk quoth he.\tsk And here are two
roads, replied I, turning short upon him,\tsh a dirty and a
clean one,\tsh which shall we take?\tsk\break
The clean,\tsk by all means, replied \textit{Eu\-genius}.  \textit{Eugenius},
said I, stepping before him, and laying my hand upon his\break
breast,\tsh to define\tsh is to distrust.\tsh\break
Thus I triumph’d over \textit{Eugenius}; but I triumph’d over
him as I always do, like a fool.\tsh ’Tis my comfort however, I
am not an obstinate one; therefore

I define a nose, as follows,\tsh intreat\-ing only beforehand, and
beseeching my readers, both male and female, of what age,
complexion, and condition soever, for the love of God and their own
souls, to guard against the temptations and suggestions of the
devil, and suffer him by no art or wile to put any other
ideas\catch{into}
into their minds, than what I put into my definition,\tsk For by
the word \textit{Nose}, throughout all this long chapter of
noses, and in every other part of my work,\break where the word
\textit{Nose} occurs,\tsk I declare, by that word I mean a Nose,
and nothing\break more, or less.

\dropcap[findent=3pt]{\Usk{24pt}W}{\lss{hat}} an unconscionable\break
jointure, my dear, do we
\stick{pay out of this small estate of ours,}
\stick{quoth my grandmother to my grand-}
father.

My father, replied my grandfather,\break had no more nose, my dear,
saving the mark, than there is upon the back of my\break
hand.\tsh

\tsk Now, you must know, that my great grandmother outlived my
grandfather twelve years; so that my father\catch{had}
had the
jointure to pay, a hundred and fifty pounds half yearly\tsk (on
\textit{Michael-\break mas} and \textit{Lady day})\tsk during all
that\break
time.

No man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than
my father.\tsh And as far as a hundred pounds went, he
would fling it upon the table, guinea by guinea, with that spirited
jerk of an honest welcome, which generous souls, and generous souls
only, are able to fling down money: but as soon as ever he
enter’d upon the odd fifty,\tsk he\break generally gave a loud
\textit{Hem!} rubb’d the side of his nose leisurely with the
flat part of his fore finger,\tsh inserted his hand
cautiously betwixt his head and the cawl of his
wig,\tsk look’d at both sides of every guinea, as he parted
with it,\tsk and seldom\catch{could} could get to the end of the fifty
pounds, without pulling out his handkerchief\break and wiping his
temples.

Defend me, gracious heaven! from 
\stck{those persecuting spirits who make no al-}
lowances for these workings within us.\tsk Never,\tsk O never may I lay down in their
tents, who cannot relax the engine, and feel pity for the force of
education, and the prevalence of opinions long derived from
ancestors!

For three generations at least, this \textit{te\-net} in favour of
long noses had gradually been taking root in our family.\tsh
\textsc{Tradition} was all along on its side, and
\textsc{Interest} was every half year stepping in to strengthen
it; so that the whimsicality of my father’s brain was far
from\catch{having}
having the whole honour of this, as it had of almost all his
other strange notions.\tsk For in a great measure he might be
said to have suck’d this in, with his mother’s milk. He did his
part however.\tsh If\break
education planted the mistake, (in case it was one) my father
watered it, and ri\-pened it to perfection.

He would often declare, in speaking his thoughts upon the
subject, that he did not conceive how the greatest family in
\textit{England} could stand it out against an uninterrupted
succession of six or seven short noses.\tsk And for the contrary
reason, he would generally add, That it\break must be one of
the greatest problems in civil life, where the same number of long
and jolly noses following one another in a direct line, did not
raise and hoist it\catch{up} up into the best vacancies in the
kingdom.\tsh He would often boast that the \textit{Shandy}
family rank’d very high in king \textit{Harry} the
VIIIth’s time, but owed its rise to no state engine,\tsk he
would say,\tsk but to that only;\tsh but that, like other
families, he would add,\tsh it had felt the turn of the
wheel, and had never recovered the blow of my
great grandfather’s nose.\tsh It was an ace of clubs
indeed, he would cry, shaking his head,\tsk and as vile a one for
an unfortunate family,\break as ever turn’d up trumps.

\tsh Fair and softly, gentle reader!\break
\tsh where is thy fancy carrying thee?\break
\tsh If there is truth in man, by my
great grandfather’s nose, I mean the external organ of smelling,
or that part of man which stands prominent in his
face,\catch{and}
\tsk and which painters say, in good jolly\break
\tight{noses and well-proportioned faces, should}\break
comprehend a full third,\tsh that is, measured
downwards from the setting on of the hair.\tsh

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXXIV.}

\dropcap{I}{t} is a singular blessing, that
nature has form’d the mind of man with the same happy
backwardness and renitency against conviction, which is observed in
old dogs,\tsk “of not learning new tricks.”

What a shuttlecock of a fellow would the greatest philosopher
that ever exist-\break ed, be whisk’d into at once, did he read\catch{such}
such books, and observe such facts, and think such thoughts, as
would eternally be making him change sides!

Now, my father, as I told you last year, detested all
this,\tsk He pick’d up an opinion, Sir, as a man in a state
of nature picks up an apple.\tsk It becomes his own,\tsk\break
and if he is a man of spirit, he would lose his life rather than
give it up.\tsh

I am aware, that \textit{Didius}, the great civilian, will contest
this point; and cry out against me, Whence comes this man’s
right to this apple? \textit{ex confesso}, he will say,\tsh things
were in a state of nature.\break\tsk The apple, as much
\textit{Frank}’s apple, as \textit{John}’s. Pray, Mr.
\textit{Shandy}, what patent has he to shew for it? and how did it
begin to be his? was it, when he set\catch{his}
his heart upon it? or when he gather’d it? or when he chew’d it?
or when he\break roasted it? or when he peel’d? or when he brought it
home? or when he digest\-ed?\tsh or when he\tsh\tsk ?\tsh.\break For ’tis
plain, Sir, if the first picking up of the apple, made it not
his,\tsh that no\break
subsequent act could.

\tight{Brother \textit{Didius}, \textit{Tribonius} will answer,\tsk}\break
(now \textit{Tribonius} the civilian and church lawyer’s beard being
three inches and a half and three eighths longer than \textit{Didius}
his beard,\tsk I’m glad he takes up the cudgels for me, so I
give myself no further trouble about the answer.)\tsk Brother
\textit{Didius, Tribonius} will say, it is a decreed case, as you may
find it in the fragments of \textit{Gregorius} and
\textit{Hermogenes}’s codes, and in all the codes from
\textit{Justinian}’s down to\catch{the} the codes of \textit{Louis} and
\textit{Des Eaux},\tsk That the sweat of a man’s brows, and
the exsudations of a man’s brains, are as much a man’s
own property, as the breeches upon his backside;\tsk which said
exsudations, \etc\@ being dropp’d upon the said apple by the
labour of finding it, and picking it up; and being moreover
indissolubly wasted, and as indissolubly annex’d by the
picker up, to the thing\break pick’d up, carried home, roasted,
peel’d, eaten, digested, and so on;\tsh ’tis
evi\-dent that the gatherer of the apple, in so doing, has
mix’d up something which was his own, with the apple which
was not his own, by which means he has acquired a
property;\tsk or, in other words, the apple is
\textit{John}’s apple.

By the same learned chain of reason-\catch{ing} 
\stick{ing my father stood up for all his opi-}
\stick{nions: he had spared no pains in pick-}
\stick{ing them up, and the more they lay out}
\stick{of the common way, the better still was}
\stick{his title.\tsh No mortal claim’d them:}
\stick{they had cost him moreover as much la-}
\stick{bour in cooking and digesting as in the}
\stick{case above, so that they might well and}
\stick{truely be said to be of his own goods and}
chattles.\sic\tsk Accordingly he held fast by
\stick{’em, both by teeth and claws,\tsk would}
\stick{fly to whatever he could lay his hands}
\stick{on,\tsk and in a word, would intrench}
\stick{and fortify them round with as many cir-}
\stick{cumvallations and breast-works, as my}
uncle \textit{Toby} would a citadel.

There was one plaguy rub in the way of this,\tsh the
scarcity of materials to make any thing of a defence with, in
case\catch{of}
of a smart attack; inasmuch as few men of great genius had
exercised their parts in writing books upon the subject of\break 
great noses: by the trotting of my lean horse, the thing is
incredible!\@  and I am quite lost in my understanding, when I am
considering what a treasure of precious time and talents
together has been wasted upon worse subjects,\tsk and how many
millions of books in all languages, and in all possible types and
bindings, have been fabricated upon points not half so much
tending to the unity and peace-making of the world.  What was to
be had, however, he set the greater store\break by; and though my
father would oft-times sport with my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
li-\break brary,\tsk which, by the bye, was ridiculous enough,\tsk yet
at the very same time he did it, he collected every book\catch{and}
and treatise which had been systematically wrote upon
noses, with as much care as my honest uncle \textit{Toby} had done
those upon military architecture.\tsh ’Tis true, a
much less table would have held them,\tsk but that was not thy
transgression, my dear uncle.\tsh

Here,\tsh but why here,\tsh rather than in any
other part of my story,\tsh I am not able to
tell:\tsh but here it is,\tsh my heart stops me to
pay to\break
thee, my dear uncle \textit{Toby}, once for all, the tribute I
owe thy goodness.\tsh Here\break
let me thrust my chair aside, and kneel\break
down upon the ground, whilst I am\break
pouring forth the warmest sentiments\break
of love for thee, and veneration for\break
the excellency of thy character, that\break
ever virtue and nature kindled in a\catch{nephew’s}
nephew’s bosom.\tsh Peace and comfort rest for evermore upon thy
head!\tsk\break
Thou envied’st no man’s comforts,\tsh\break
insulted’st no man’s opinions.\tsh Thou\break
blackened’st no man’s character,\tsh\break
devoured’st no man’s bread: gently,\break
with faithful \textit{Trim} behind thee, didst\break
thou amble round the little circle of\break
thy pleasures, jostling no creature in\break
thy way;\tsk for each one’s service,\break
thou hadst a tear,\tsk for each man’s\break
need, thou hadst a shilling.

Whilst I am worth one, to pay a\break
weeder,\tsk thy path from thy door to\break
thy bowling-green shall never be grown\break
up.\tsh Whilst there is a rood and a\break
half of land in the \textit{Shandy} family, thy\break

\stick{\hfill How the communication was conveyed}
into \textit{Slawkenbergius}’s sensorium,\tsk so that
\textit{Slawkenbergius} should know whose finger touch’d the
key,\tsh and whose hand it was that blew the bellows,\tsh as
\textit{Hafen Slawkenbergius} has been dead and laid in his
grave above fourscore and ten years,\tsh we can only raise
conjectures.

\textit{Slawkenbergius} was play’d upon, for aught I know,
like one of \textit{Whitefield}’s disciples,\tsk that
is, with such a distinct\break
intelligence, Sir, of which of the two
\textit{masters} it was, that had been practising upon his
\textit{instrument},\tsh as to make all reasoning upon it
needless.

\tsh For in the account which \textit{Hafen Slawkenbergius}
gives the world of his\break motives and occasions for
writing, and\break spending so many years of his life
upon\catch{this} this one work.\tsk Towards the end of his
prolegomena, which by the bye should have come first,\tsh
but the bookbinder has most injudiciously placed it betwixt
the analitical\sic\ contents of the book, and the book
itself,\tsk he informs his reader, that ever since he had
arrived at the age of discernment, and was able to sit down
coolly, and consider within himself the true state and
condition of man, and distinguish the main end and design of
his being;\tsk or,\tsk to shorten my trans-\break
lation, for \textit{Slawkenbergius}’s book is in\break
\textit{Latin}, and not a little prolix in this pas-\break
sage,\tsk ever since I understood, quoth\break
\textit{Slawkenbergius}, any thing,\tsk or rather\break
\textit{what was what},\tsk and could perceive\break
that the point of long noses had been too\break
loosely handled by all who had gone be-\break 
fore;\tsh have I, \textit{Slawkenbergius}, felt a\break
strong impulse, with a mighty and un-\catch{resistible} resistible call
within me, to gird up myself to this undertaking.

\noindent
\stick{\hfill And to do justice to \textit{Slawkenbergius}, he}
has entered the
list with a stronger lance, and taken a much larger career in it,
than any one man who had ever entered it \stick{before
him,\tsk and indeed, in many resp-} ects, deserves to be
\textit{en-nich’d} as a prototype for all writers, of
voluminous works at least, to model their books by,\tsh for
he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject,\tsk examined every part
of it, \textit{dialectically},\tsk\break
then brought it into full
day; dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision
of his own natural parts could strike,\tsk or the profoundest
knowledge of the sciences had impowered him to cast upon
it,\tsk collating, collecting, and compiling,\tsk begging,
borrowing, and stealing, as he went along, all that had\catch{been}
been wrote or wrangled thereupon in the schools and porticos
of the learned: so that \textit{Slawkenbergius} his book may
properly be considered, not only as a model,\tsk but as a
thorough-stitch’d \textsc{digest} and regular institute of
\textit{noses}; comprehending in it, all that is, or can be
needful to be known about them.

For this cause it is, that I forbear to speak of so many
(otherwise) valuable books and treatises of my father’s
collecting, wrote either, plump upon noses,\tsh or
collaterally touching them;\tsh such for instance as
\textit{Prignitz}, now lying upon the table before me, who with
infinite learning, and from the most candid and scholar-like
examination of above four thousand different skulls, in upwards of
\stck{twenty charnel houses in \textit{Silesia}, which he} had
rummaged,\tsk has informed us, that\catch{the} the mensuration and
configuration of the osseous or boney parts of human noses, in any
\textit{given} tract of country, except \textit{Crim Tartary}, where
they are all crush’d down by the thumb, so that no judgment
can be formed upon them,\tsk are much nearer alike, than the world
imagines;\tsk the difference amongst them being, he says, a mere
trifle, not worth taking notice of,\break
\tsh but that the size and jollity of every individual nose, and by
which one nose ranks above another, and bears a higher price, is
owing to the cartilaginous and muscular parts of it, into whose
ducts and sinuses the blood and animal spirits being impell’d,
and driven by the warmth and force of the imagination, which is but
a step from it, (bating the case of idiots, whom \textit{Prignitz},
who had lived many years in \textit{Turky}, supposes under the more
immediate tutelage of heaven)\tsk it so\catch{hap-} happens, and ever must,
says \textit{Prignitz}, that the excellency of the nose is in a
direct arithmetical proportion to the excellency of the
wearer’s fancy.

It is for the same reason, that is, because ’tis all
comprehended in \textit{Slawkenbergius}, that I say nothing likewise
of \stick{\textit{Scroderus (Andrea)} who all the world} knows, set himself
to oppugn \textit{Prignitz} with great violence,\tsk proving it in
his own way, first, \textit{logically}, and then by a series of
stubborn facts, \lqq That so far was \textit{Prignitz} from
the truth, in affirming that the fancy begat the nose, that on the contrary,\tsk the nose begat
the fancy.\,”

\tsk The learned suspected \textit{Scroderus}, of an indecent
sophism in this,\tsk and \textit{Prignitz} cried out aloud in the
dispute, that \textit{Scroderus} had shifted the idea upon
him,\catch{but}
\tsk but \textit{Scroderus} went on, maintaining his
thesis.\tsh

My father was just balancing within himself, which of the
two sides he should take in this affair; when
\textit{Ambrose Paræus} decided it in a moment, and by
overthrowing the systems, both of \textit{Prignitz} and
\textit{Scroderus}, drove my father out of both sides of the
controversy at once.

Be witness\tsh

I don’t acquaint the learned reader,\tsk in saying it, I
mention it only to shew the learned, I know the fact
myself.\tsh

That this \textit{Ambrose Paræus} was chief surgeon and
nose-mender to \textit{Francis} the ninth of
\textit{France}, and in high credit with him and the two
preceding, or succeed-\catch{ing} ing kings (I know not which)\tsk and
that except in the slip he made in his story of
\textit{Taliacotius}’s noses, and his manner of setting them
on,\tsk was esteemed by the whole college of physicians
at that time, as more knowing in matters of noses, than any
one who had ever taken them in hand.

Now \textit{Ambrose Paræus} convinced my father, that the
true and efficient cause of what had engaged so much the attention
of the world, and upon which \textit{Prignitz} and \textit{Scroderus}
had wasted so much learning and fine parts,\tsh was neither
this nor that,\tsh but that the length and good-\break
\stick{ness of the nose was owing simply to the}
\stick{\tight{softness and flaccidity in the nurse’s breast,}}\break
\stick{\tsh as the flatness and shortness of \textit{puisne}}\break
noses was, to the firmness and elastic repulsion of
the same organ of nutri-\catch{tion} tion in the hale and lively,\tsk which,
tho’ happy for the woman, was the undoing of the child,
inasmuch as his nose was so snubb’d, so rebuff’d, so
rebated, and so refrigerated thereby, as never to arrive \textit{ad
mensuram suam legitimam};\tsh but that in case of the
flaccidity and softness of the nurse or mother’s
breast,\tsk by sinking into it, quoth \textit{Paræus}, as into so much butter, the
nose was comforted, nourish’d, plump’d up,
refresh’d, refocillated, and set a growing for ever.

I have but two things to observe of \textit{Paræus}; first, that
he proves and ex\-plains all this with the utmost chastity and\break
decorum of expression:\tsk for which may his soul for ever rest
in peace!

\noindent
\stick{\hfill And, secondly, that besides the systems} 
of \textit{Prignitz} and \textit{Scroderus}, which
\textit{Ambrose}\catch{\textit{Paræus}} \textit{Paræus} his
hypothesis effectually overthrew,\tsk it overthrew at the same
time the system of peace and harmony of our family; and for
three days together, not only embroiled matters between my
father and my mother, but turn’d likewise \stick{the whole house
and every thing in}\break \stick{it, except my uncle
\textit{Toby}, quite upside} down.

Such a ridiculous tale of a dispute between a man and his wife,
never surely in any age or country got vent through the key-hole of
a street-door!

My mother, you must know,\tsh but
I have fifty things more necessary to let 
you know first,\tsk I have a hundred
difficulties which I have promised to clear
up, and a thousand distresses and domestic 
misadventures crouding in upon me\catch{thick}

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXXIX.}

\dropcap{T}{here} was not any one scene more
entertaining in our family,\tsk and\break to do it justice in this
point;\tsh and I\break here put off my cap and lay it upon the\break
table close beside my ink-horn, on purpose to make my declaration
to the world concerning this one article, the more
so\-lemn,\tsh that I believe in my soul, (un-\catch{less} less my love and
partiality to my understanding blinds me) the hand of the su\-preme
Maker and first Designer of all things, never made or put a family
toge\-ther, (in that period at least of it, which I have sat down to
write the story of)\tsh where the characters of it were cast
or contrasted with so dramatic a felicity as ours was, for this
end; or in which the\break
capacities of affording such exquisite\break
scenes, and the powers of shifting them perpetually from morning to night,
were lodged and intrusted with so unlimited a confidence, as in the
\textsc{Shandy-Family}.

Not any one of these was more diverting, I say, in this
whimsical theatre of ours,\tsk than what frequently arose
out of this self-same chapter of long noses,\tsh especially
when my father’s imagination \stck{was heated with the enquiry, and
nothing}\catch{would} would serve him but to heat my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
too.

My uncle \textit{Toby} would give my father all possible fair play
in this attempt; and with infinite patience would sit smoaking his
pipe for whole hours together, whilst my father was practising upon
his head, and trying every accessible avenue to drive
\textit{Prignitz} and \textit{Scroderus}’s solutions into it.

Whether they were above my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
reason,\tsh or contrary to it,\tsh or that his brain was like wet
tinder, and no spark could possibly take hold,\tsh or that
it was so full of saps, mines, blinds, curtins, and such military
disqualifications to his seeing clearly into \textit{Prignitz} and
\textit{Scroderus}’s doctrines,\tsk I say not,\tsk 
\stick{\tight{let school-men\tsk scullions, anatomists, and}}\catch{engi-} 
engineers, fight for it amongst them-\break selves,\tsh

’Twas some misfortune, I make no\break
doubt, in this affair,
that my father had every word of it to translate for the bene\-fit of
my uncle \textit{Toby}, and render out of
\textit{Slawkenbergius}’s \textit{Latin}, of which, as he was no
great master, his translation was not always of the
purest,\tsk and generally\break \tight{least so where ’twas most
wanted,\tsk this} naturally open’d a door to a second
misfortune;\tsk \tight{that in the warmer paroxisms}\break
of his zeal to open my uncle \textit{Toby}’s eyes\break
\tsh my father’s ideas run on, as much faster than the translation, as
the translation outmoved my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s;\tsh\break
neither the one or the other added much\break
to the perspicuity of my father’s lecture.

\dropcap{T}{he} gift of ratiocination and mak-\break
ing syllogisms,\tsh I mean in man,\break
\tsk for in superior classes of being, such\break
as angels and spirits,\tsh ’tis all done, may\break
it please your worships, as they tell me,\break
by \textsc{Intuition};\tsk and beings inferior, as\break
your worships all know,\tsk\tsk syllogize by\break
their noses: though there is an island\break
\tight{swiming in the sea, though not altogether}\break
at its ease, whose inhabitants, if my intel-\break
ligence deceives me not, are so wonder-\break
fully gifted, as to syllogize after the same\break
fashion, and oft-times to make very well\break
out too:\tsh but that’s neither here nor\break
there\tsh

The gift of doing it as it should be, amongst us, \tsk or the
great and principal\catch{act} act of ratiocination in man, as logicians tell
us, is the finding out the agreement or disagreement of two ideas
one with another, by the intervention of a third; (called the
\textit{medius terminus)\sic} just as a man, as \textit{Locke} well
observes, by a yard, finds two mens nine-pin-alleys to be of the same
length, which could not be brought together, to measure their
equality, by \textit{juxta-position.}

Had the same great reasoner looked \stick{on, as my father illustrated
his systems of} noses, and observed my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
deportment,\tsk what great attention he gave to every
word,\tsk and as oft as he took his pipe from his mouth, with what
wonder-\break \tight{ful seriousness he contemplated the length} of
it,\tsk surveying it transversely as he held it betwixt his
finger and his thumb,\break\tsk then foreright,\tsk then
this way, and\catch{then} then that, in all its possible directions and
foreshortenings,\tsh he would have concluded my uncle
\textit{Toby} had got hold of the \textit{medius terminus}; and was
syllogizing and measuring with it the truth of each hypothesis of
long noses, in order, as my father laid them before him. This
by the bye, was more than my father wanted,\tsh his aim in
all the pains he was at in these philosophic lectures,\tsk was to
enable my uncle \textit{Toby} not to
\textit{discuss},\tsk but \textit{comprehend}\tsk to \textit{hold} the grains
and scruples of learning,\tsk not to \textit{weigh}
them.\tsk\break My uncle \textit{Toby}, as you will read in the
next chapter, did neither the one or the other.

\dropcap{’T}{is} a pity, cried my father
one winter’s night, after a three hours\break painful translation
of \textit{Slawkenbergius},\tsk ’tis a pity, cried my
father, putting my mother’s thread-paper into the book for a
mark, as he spoke\tsh that truth, bro\-ther \textit{Toby},
should shut herself up in such impregnable fastnesses, and be so
obstinate as not to surrender herself sometimes up upon the closest
siege.\tsh

\noindent
\stick{\hfill Now it happened then, as indeed it had} often
done before, that my uncle \textit{Toby}’s fancy, during the
time of my father’s explanation of \textit{Prignitz} to
him,\tsh having nothing to stay it there, had taken a short
flight to the bowling-green;\tsh his body might as well have
taken a turn there\catch{too,}
\stick{too,\tsk so that with all the semblance of}
\stick{\tight{a deep school-man intent upon the \textit{medius}}}
\textit{terminus},\tsh my uncle \textit{Toby} was in fact\break
as ignorant
of the whole lecture, and all its pro’s and con’s, as if my
father had been translating \textit{Hafen Slawkenbergius}\break
from the \textit{Latin} tongue into the \textit{Cherokeè}.
But the word \textit{siege}, like a talismanic\break
power, in my
father’s metaphor, wafting back my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
fancy, quick as a note could follow the touch,\tsk he open’d
his ears,\tsk and my father observing that he took his pipe
out of his mouth, and shuffled his chair nearer the table,
as with a desire to profit,\tsk my father with great
pleasure began his sentence again,\tsh changing only the
plan, and dropping the metaphor of the siege of it, to keep
clear of some dangers my father apprehended from it.

\smallskip
\rightline{’Tis}

\newpage
’Tis a pity, said my father, that truth can only be on one
side, brother \textit{Toby},\,\tsk\break
\stck{considering what ingenuity these learned}
men have all shewn in their solutions of
noses.\tsh Can noses be dissolved? repli\-ed my uncle
\textit{Toby}.\tsh

\tsh My father thrust back his chair,\break
\tsh rose up,\tsk put on his
hat,\tsk took four long strides to the
door,\tsk jerked it open,\tsk thrust his head half
way out,\tsk shut the door again,\tsk took no
notice of the bad hinge,\tsk returned to the
table,\tsk\break pluck’d my mother’s thread-paper out of
\textit{Slawkenbergius}’s book,\tsk went hastily to his
bureau,\tsk walk’d slowly back, twisting my mother’s
thread-paper about his thumb,\tsk unbutton’d his
waistcoat,\tsh threw my mother’s thread-paper into the
fire,\tsk bit her sattin pin-cushion in two, fill’d
his mouth with bran,\tsk confound-\break ed it;\tsk but mark!\tsk the
oath of confu-\catch{sion}
\stck{sion was levell’d at my uncle \textit{Toby}’s brain,}
\tsh which was e’en confused enough already,\tsh the curse
came charged only with the bran,\tsk the bran, may it please
your honours,\tsk was no more than powder to the ball.

’Twas well my father’s passions lasted not long; for
so long as they did last, they led him a busy life on’t, and
it is one of the most unaccountable problems that ever I met with
in my observations of human nature, that nothing should prove my
father’s mettle so much, or make his passions go off so like
gun-powder, as the unexpected strokes his science met with from the
quaint simplicity of my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
questions.\tsh Had ten dozen of hornets stung him behind
in so many different places all at one time,\tsk he could not have
exerted more mechanical functions in fewer seconds,\tsk or
started half so\catch{much,} much, as with one single \textit{quære} of
three words unseasonably popping in full upon him in his
hobbyhorsical career.

’Twas all one to my uncle \textit{Toby}\tsk he
smoaked his pipe on, with unvaried composure,\tsk his heart
never intended offence to his brother,\tsk and as his head could
seldom find out where the sting of it lay,\break\tsh he always
gave my father the credit of cooling by himself.\tsh He
was five minutes and thirty-five seconds about it in the present
case.

By all that’s good!\@ said my father, swearing, as he came
to himself, and taking the oath out of \textit{Ernulphus}’s
digest of curses,\tsk (though to do my father
justice it was a fault (as he told \drslop in the affair of
\textit{Ernulphus}) which he as seldom committed as any man upon
earth.)\tsh\break
\stick{By all that’s good and great!
brother}\catch{\textit{Toby,}} \enlargethispage\baselineskip
\stick{\textit{Toby}, said my father, if it was not for the}
aids of philosophy, which befriend one\break
so much as they do,\tsk you would put a\break
man beside all temper.\tsk Why, by the
\textit{so}-\break\textit{lutions} of noses, of which I was telling you, I meant as
you might have known, had you favoured me with one grain of
attention, the various accounts which\break
learned men of different
kinds of know\-ledge have given the world, of the causes of short and
long noses.\tsk There is no cause but one, replied my
uncle \textit{Toby},\tsk why one man’s nose is longer
than ano\-ther’s, but because that God pleases to
\stck{have it so.\tsk That is \textit{Grangousier}’s
solution,} said
my father.\tsk ’Tis he, continued my uncle \textit{Toby},
looking up, and not regarding my father’s interruption, who
makes us all, and frames and puts us together in such forms and
proportions, and for such ends, as is agreeable to his
infinite\break
\stick{wisdom.\tsh ’Tis a pious account, cried}\catch{my} my father,
but not philosophical,\tsk there is more religion in it than sound
science. ’Twas no inconsistent part of my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s character,\tsk that he feared God, and
reverenced religion.\tsh So the moment my father finished
his remark,\tsh my uncle \textit{Toby} fell a whistling
\textit{Lillabullero}, with more zeal (though more out of tune) than
usual.\tsh

What is become of my wife’s thread-paper?

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XLII.}

\dropcap[nindent=1pt]{N}{o} matter,\tsh as an appendage to\break
\tight{seamstressy, the thread-paper might}\break
be of some consequence to my
mother,\tsk of none to my father, \tight{as a mark in \textit{Slaw\-kenbergius.
Slawkenbergius} in every page of}\break
him was a rich treasure of inexhaustible\break
knowledge to my father,\tsk he could not\catch{open} 
open \enlargethispage\baselineskip
him amiss; and he would often say in closing the book,
that if all the arts and sciences in the world, with the
books which treated of them, were lost,\tsk\break should the
wisdom and policies of governments, he would say, through
dis-\break use, ever happen to be forgot, and all that statesmen had
wrote, or caused to be written, upon the strong or the weak
sides of courts and kingdoms, should\break they be forgot
also,\tsk and \textit{Slawkenbergius}\break only left,\tsk there
would be enough in him in all conscience, he would say, to
set the world a-going again. A treasure therefore was he
indeed! an institute of all that was necessary to be known
of noses, and every thing else,\tsk at \textit{matin}, noon,
and vespers was \textit{Hafen Slawkenbergius} his recreation
and delight: ’twas for ever in his hands,\tsh you would have
sworn, Sir, it had been a canon’s prayer-book,\tsk so worn,
so glazed, so contrited\catch{and} and attrited was it with fingers
and with thumbs in all its parts, from one end even unto the
other.

I am not such a bigot to \textit{Slawkenber\-gius} as my
father;\tsk there is a fund in him, no doubt: but in my
opinion, the best, I don’t say the most profitable,\break but
the most amusing part of \textit{Hafen}\break\textit{Slawkenbergius}, is
his tales,\tsh and, considering he was a \textit{German},
many of them told not without fancy:\tsh these take up\break his
second book, containing nearly one half of his folio, and are
comprehended in ten decads, each decad containing ten
tales.\tsh Philosophy is not built upon
\stck{tales; and therefore ’twas certainly wrong}
in \textit{Slawkenbergius} to send them into the 
world by that name;\tsk there are a few of 
\stck{them in his eight, ninth, and tenth decads,}
\stck{which I own seem rather playful and spor-}
tive, than speculative,\tsk but in general\catch{they}
they are to be looked upon by the learned as a detail of so many
independent facts, all of them turning round somehow or other upon
the main hinges of his subject, and added to his work as so many
illustrations upon the doctrines of noses.

As we have leisure enough upon our hands,\tsh if you
give me leave, madam, I’ll tell you the ninth tale of his
tenth decad.
