\stick{much more so, when he laughs,}
\stick{that it adds something to this Frag-}

I humbly beg, Sir, that you\break
\stick{will honour this book by taking}
\stick{it \tsh (not under your Protection,}
\stick{\tsh it must protect itself, but)\tsk}

\stick{had minded what they were about when}
\stick{they begot me; had they duly consider’d} 
\stick{how much depended upon what they}
\stick{were then doing;\tsk that not only the}
\stick{production of a rational Being was con-}

\catch{per-} 
perhaps his genius and the very cast of\break
his mind;\tsk and, for aught they knew to the contrary, even the fortunes of his
whole house might take their turn from 
\stck{the humours and dispositions which were}
\stick{then uppermost:\tsk Had they duly}
\stick{weighed and considered all this, and}
\stick{proceeded accordingly,\tsk I am verily}
\stick{persuaded I should have made a quite}
\stick{different figure in the world, from that,}
\stick{in which the reader is likely to see me.\tsk}
\stick{Believe me, good folks, this is not so}
\stick{inconsiderable a thing as many of you}
\stick{may think it;\tsk you have all, I dare say,}
\stck{heard of the animal spirits, as how they are}
\stick{transfused from father to son, \&c.\,\&c.\tsk}
\stick{and a great deal to that purpose:\tsk Well,}
\stick{you may take my word, that nine parts}
\stick{in ten of a man’s sense or his nonsense,}
\stick{his successes and miscarriages in this}
\stick{world depend upon their motions and ac-}
\catch{tivity,}
\parskip 14pt
\stick{tivity, and the different tracks and trains}
\stick{you put them into, so that when they}
\stick{are once set a-going, whether right or} 
\stck{wrong, ’tis not a halfpenny matter,\tsk away}
\stick{they go cluttering like hey-go-mad; and}

\stick{as plain and as smooth as a garden-walk,}
\stick{which, when they are once used to, the}
\stick{Devil himself sometimes shall not be able}
to drive them off it.

\i{Pray, my dear,} quoth my mother, \i{have}\break
\stick{\i{you not forgot to wind up the clock?}\tsh}
\stick{\i{Good G\tsk!} cried my father, making an} 
\stick{exclamation, but taking care to moderate}

\stick{\i{woman, since the creation of the world, in-}}
\stick{\i{terrupt a man with such a silly question?}}
\stick{Pray, what was your father saying?\tsh}
Nothing.\patch{\lsss{CHAP}.}

\chap{II}{24pt}{8pt}

\tsh Then, positively, there is nothing\break
\stick{in the question, that I can see, either good}
\stick{or bad.\tsk Then, let me tell you, Sir,}
\stick{it was a very unseasonable question at}
\stick{least,\tsk because it scattered and dispersed}
\stick{the animal spirits, whose business it was} 
\stick{to have escorted and gone hand-in-hand} 
\stick{with the \lss{\itshape HOMUNCULUS}, and con-}
\stick{ducted him safe to the place destined for}
his reception.

The \s{Homunculus}, Sir, in how-ever\break
\stick{low and ludicrous a light he may appear,}
\stick{in this age of levity, to the eye of folly} 
\stick{or prejudice:\tsk to the eye of reason in} 
\stck{scientifick research, he stands confess’d\tsk}
\stick{a \s{Being} guarded and circumscribed with} 
\stick{rights:\tsk The minutest philosophers,}
\catch{who,}
\stick{who, by the bye, have the most enlarged} 
\stick{understandings, (their souls being in-}
\stick{versely as their enquiries) shew us incon-}
\stick{testably, That the \s{Homunculus} is}
\stick{created by the same hand,\tsk engender’d} 
\stick{in the same course of nature,\tsk endowed}
\stick{with the same loco-motive powers and} 
\stick{faculties with us:\tsk That he consists,}
\stick{as we do, of skin, hair, fat, flesh, veins,}
\stick{arteries, ligaments, nerves, cartileges,}
\stick{bones, marrow, brains, glands, genitals,}
\stick{humours, and articulations;\tsk is a Be-}
\stick{ing of as much activity,\tsk and, in all} 
\stick{senses of the word, as much and as truly} 
\stick{our fellow-creature as my Lord Chancel-}
\stick{lor of England.\tsk He may be benefited,}
\stick{he may be injured,\tsk he may obtain re-}
\stick{dress;\tsk in a word, he has all the claims}
\stick{and rights of humanity, which \i{Tully},}
\stick{\i{Puffendorff}, or the best ethick writers}
\catch{allow} 
\parskip 12pt
\stick{allow to arise out of that state and rela-}
tion.

Now, dear Sir, what if any accident\break 
\stick{had befallen him in his way alone?\tsk}
\stick{or that, thro’ terror of it, natural to so}
\stick{young a traveller, my little gentleman} 
\stick{had got to his journey’s end miserably} 
\stick{spent;\tsk his muscular strength and}
\stick{virility worn down to a thread;\tsk his}
\stick{own animal spirits ruffled beyond de-}
\stick{scription,\tsk and that in this sad disorder’d}
\stick{state of nerves, he had laid down a prey} 
\stick{to sudden starts, or a series of melan-}
\stick{choly dreams and fancies for nine long,}
\stick{long months together.\tsh I tremble to}
\stick{think what a foundation had been laid}
\stick{for a thousand weaknesses both of body}
\stick{and mind, which no skill of the physi-}
\stick{cian or the philosopher could ever after-}
wards have set thoroughly to rights.\patch{\lsss{CHAP}.}

\dropcap{T}{o} my uncle Mr.\@ \i{Toby Shandy} do~I\break
stand indebted for the preceding\break
\stick{anecdote, to whom my father, who was}
\stick{an excellent natural philosopher, and}
\stick{much given to close reasoning upon the}
\stick{smallest matters, had oft, and heavily,}
\stick{complain’d of the injury; but once more}
\stick{particularly, as my uncle \toby well re-}
\stick{member’d, upon his observing a most}
\stick{unaccountable obliquity, (as he call’d it)}
\stick{in my manner of setting up my top, and} 
\stick{justifying the principles upon which I}
\stick{had done it,\tsk the old gentleman shook}
\stick{his head, and in a tone more expressive} 
\stick{by half of sorrow than reproach,\tsk he said} 
\stick{his heart all along foreboded, and he}
\stick{saw it verified in this, and from a thou-}
\stick{sand other observations he had made up-}
\catch{on}
\stick{on me, That I should neither think nor}
\stick{act like any other man’s child:\tsh \i{But}}
\stick{\i{alas!} continued he, shaking his head a}
\stick{second time, and wiping away a tear} 
\stick{which was trickling down his cheeks,} 
\stck{\i{My Tristram’s misfortunes began nine months}}
\i{before ever he came into the world}.

\tsh My mother, who was sitting by,\break
\stick{look’d up,\tsk but she knew no more than}
\stick{her backside what my father meant,\tsk but}
\stick{my uncle, Mr.\@ \i{Toby Shandy}, who had}
\stick{been often informed of the affair,\tsk un-}
derstood him very well.

\chap{IV}{28pt}{10pt}

\initial{I}{Know} there are readers in the world,\break
as well as many other good people\break
\stick{in it, who are no readers at all,\tsk who}
\catch{find} 
\parskip 14pt
\stick{find themselves ill at ease, unless they are} 
\stick{let into the whole secret from first to last,} 
of every thing which concerns you.

It is in pure compliance with this hu-\break
\stick{mour of theirs, and from a backwardness} 
\stick{in my nature to disappoint any one soul}
\stick{living, that I have been so very particu-}
\stick{lar already. As my life and opinions are}
\stick{likely to make some noise in the world,} 
\stick{and, if I conjecture right, will take in all}
\stick{ranks, professions, and denominations of} 
\stick{men whatever,\tsk be no less read than the}
\stick{\i{Pilgrim’s Progress} itself\tsk and, in the end,}
\stick{prove the very thing which \i{Montaigne}}
\stick{dreaded his essays should turn out, that} 
\stick{is, a book for a parlour-window;\tsk I find} 
\stick{it necessary to consult every one a little} 
\stick{in his turn; and therefore must beg par-}
\stick{don for going on a little further in the} 
\stick{same way: For which cause, right glad}
\catch{I}
\stick{I am, that I have begun the history of}
\stick{myself in the way I have done; and}
\stick{that I am able to go on tracing every} 
thing in it, as \i{Horace} says, \i{ab Ovo}.

\i{Horace}, I know, does not recommend\break
\stick{this fashion altogether: But that gentle-}
\stick{man is speaking only of an epic poem or}
\stick{a tragedy;\tsk (I forget which)\tsk besides,}
\stick{if it was not so, I should beg Mr.\@ \i{Horace}’s}
\stick{pardon;\tsk for in writing what I have set}
\stick{about, I shall confine myself neither to}
\stick{his rules, nor to any man’s rules that ever}
lived.

To such, however, as do not choose to\break 
\stick{go so far back into these things, I can}
\stick{give no better advice, than that they}
\stick{skip over the remaining part of this} 
\stick{Chapter; for I declare before hand, ’tis}
\catch{wrote}
\stick{wrote only for the curious and inquisi-}
tive.

\stick{\indent\tsfill\hbox{Shut the door.}\tsfill}
\stick{I was begot in the night, betwixt the first}
\stick{\i{Sunday} and the first \i{Monday} in the month} 
\stick{of \i{March}, in the year of our Lord one} 
\stick{thousand seven hundred and eighteen.}
\stick{I am positive I was.\tsk But how I came}
\stick{to be so very particular in my account}
\stick{of a thing which happened before I was}
\stick{born, is owing to another small anecdote}
\stick{known only in our own family, but now}
\stick{made publick for the better clearing up} 
this point.

My father, you must know, who was\break
\stick{originally a \i{Turkey} merchant, but had left}
\stick{off business for some years, in order to}
\stick{retire to, and die upon, his paternal estate}
\stick{in the county of\tsfill,  was, I believe,}
\catch{one} 
\stick{one of the most regular men in every} 
\stick{thing he did, whether ’twas matter of}
\stick{business, or matter of amusement, that} 
\stick{ever lived. As a small specimen of this}
\stick{extreme exactness of his, to which he}
\stick{was in truth a slave,\tsk he had made it a} 
\stick{rule for many years of his life,\tsk on the} 
\stck{first \i{Sunday night} of every month through-}
\stick{out the whole year,\tsk as certain as ever} 
\stck{the \i{Sunday night} came,\tsh to wind up a} 
\stick{large house-clock which we had standing}
\stick{upon the back-stairs head, with his own}
\stick{hands:\tsk And being somewhere between}
\stick{fifty and sixty years of age, at the time I}
\stick{have been speaking of,\tsk he had likewise} 
\stick{gradually brought some other little fa-}
\stick{mily concernments to the same period,}
\stick{in order, as he would often say to my}
\stick{uncle \toby, to get them all out of the}
\stick{way at one time, and be no more plagued}
\catch{and}
\stick{and pester’d with them the rest of the} 
month.

It was attended but with one misfor-\break
\stick{tune, which, in a great measure, fell upon}
\stick{myself, and the effects of which I fear}
\stick{I shall carry with me to my grave;}
\stck{namely, that, from an unhappy association}
\stick{of ideas which have no connection in na-}
\stick{ture, it so fell out at length, that my} 
\stick{poor mother could never hear the said} 
\stick{clock wound up,\tsk but the thoughts of} 
\stick{some other things unavoidably popp’d} 
\stick{into her head,\tsk \et\ \i{vice versâ:}\tsk which}
\stick{strange combination of ideas, the saga-}
\stick{cious \i{Locke}, who certainly understood}
\stick{the nature of these things better than} 
\stick{most men, affirms to have produced}
\stick{more wry actions than all other sources}
of prejudice whatsoever.\\\indent
But this by the bye.\patch{Now}

Now it appears, by a memorandum in\break
\stick{my father’s pocket-book, which now lies} 
\stick{upon the table, \lqq That on \i{Lady-Day},} 
\stick{which was on the 25th of the same month} 
\stick{in which I date my geniture,\tsk my father}
\stick{set out upon his journey to \i{London} with}
\stick{my eldest brother \i{Bobby}, to fix him at}
\stick{\i{Westminster} school;” and, as it appears} 
\stick{from the same authority, \lqq That he did} 
\stick{not get down to his wife and family till} 
\stick{the \i{second week} in \i{May} following,\,”\tsk it} 
\stick{brings the thing almost to a certainty.}
\stick{However, what follows in the beginning} 
\stick{of the next chapter puts it beyond all}
possibility of doubt.

\tsh But pray, Sir, What was your\break
\stick{father doing all \i{December},\tsk\i{January}, and}

\stick{four \i{English} miles diameter, or there-}
\stick{abouts, of which the cottage where the}
\stick{good old woman lived, is supposed to be}
\stick{the centre.\tsk She had been left it\sic,}
\stick{seems, a widow in great distress, with} 
\stick{three or four small children, in her forty-}
\stick{seventh year; and as she was at that time}
\stick{a person of decent carriage,\tsk grave de-}
\stick{portment,\tsk a woman moreover of few}
\stick{words, and withall an object of compas-}
\stick{sion, whose distress and silence under it}
\stick{call’d out the louder for a friendly lift:}
\stick{the wife of the parson of the parish was} 
\stick{touch’d with pity; and having often la-}
\stick{mented an inconvenience, to which her} 
\stick{husband’s flock had for many years been} 
\stick{exposed, inasmuch, as there was no such}
\stick{thing as a midwife, of any kind or de-}
\catch{gree}
\stick{gree to be got at, let the case have been}
\stick{never so urgent, within less than six or}
\stck{seven long miles riding; which said seven}
\stick{long miles in dark nights and dismal} 
\stick{roads, the country thereabouts being no-}
\stick{thing but a deep clay, was almost equal to}
\stck{fourteen; and that in effect was sometimes} 
\stick{next to having no midwife at all; it came}
\stick{into her head, that it would be doing as} 
\stck{seasonable a kindness to the whole parish,}
\stick{as to the poor creature herself, to get}
\stick{her a little instructed in some of the plain}
\stick{principles of the business, in order to set}
\stick{her up in it. As no woman thereabouts}
\stick{was better qualified to execute the plan}
\stick{she had formed than herself, the Gentle-}
\stck{woman very charitably undertook it; and}
\stick{having great influence over the female}
\stick{part of the parish, she found no difficulty}
\stick{in effecting it to the utmost of her wishes.} 
\stick{In truth, the parson join’d his interest}
\catch{with} 
\stick{with his wife’s in the whole affair; and}
\stick{in order to do things as they should be,} 
\stick{and give the poor soul as good a title by}
\stick{law to practise, as his wife had given by}
\stick{institution,\tsk he chearfully paid the}
\stick{fees for the ordinaries licence himself,}
\stick{amounting, in the whole, to the sum of}
\stick{eighteen shillings and fourpence; so that,}
\stick{betwixt them both, the good woman}
\stick{was fully invested in the real and corpo-}
\stick{ral possession of her office, together with}
\stick{all its \i{rights}, \i{members}, \i{and appurtenances}}
\i{whatsoever}.

These last words, you must know,\break
\stick{were not according to the old form in} 
\stck{which such licences, faculties, and powers}
\stick{usually ran, which in like cases had here-}
\stick{tofore been granted to the sisterhood.} 
\stick{But it was according to a neat \i{Formula}} 
\stick{of \i{Didius} his own devising, who having}
\catch{a} 
\stick{a particular turn for taking to pieces,}
\stick{and new framing over again, all kind of}

\initial{I}{Solemnly} declare to all mankind, that\break
the above dedication was made for\break
\stick{no one Prince, Prelate, Pope, or Poten-}
\stick{tate,\tsk Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount,} 
\stick{or Baron of this, or any other Realm in}
\stick{Christendom;\tsh nor has it yet been} 
\stick{hawk’d about, or offered publickly or}
\stick{privately, directly or indirectly, to any} 
\stick{one person or personage, great or small;}
\stick{but is honestly a true Virgin-Dedication}
untried on, upon any soul living.

I labour this point so particularly,\break 
\stick{merely to remove any offence or objec-}
\stick{tion which might arise against it, from}
\stick{the manner in which I propose to make} 
\stick{the most of it;\tsk which is the putting}
\catch{it} 
\stick{it up fairly to publick sale; which I now} 
do.

\tsh Every author has a way of his\break
\stick{own, in bringing his points to bear;\tsk for}
\stick{my own part, as I hate chaffering and}
\stick{higgling for a few guineas in a dark}
\stick{entry;\tsk I resolved within myself, from}
\stick{the very beginning, to deal squarely and} 
\stick{openly with your Great Folks in this af-}
\stick{fair,  and try whether I should not come}
off the better by it.

If therefore there is any one Duke,\break 
\stick{Marquis, Earl, Viscount, or Baron, in}
\stck{these his Majesty’s dominions, who  stands}
\stick{in need of a tight, genteel dedication,}
\stick{and whom the above will suit, (for by}
\stick{the bye, unless it suits in some degree, I}
\stick{will not part with it)\tsh it is much at}
\stick{his service for fifty guineas;\tsh which}
\catch{I}
\stick{I am positive is twenty guineas less than}
\stick{it ought to be afforded for, by any man}
of genius.

My Lord, if you examine it over\break 
\stick{again, it is far from being a gross piece}
\stick{of daubing, as some dedications are.}
\stick{The design, your Lordship sees, is good,} 
\stick{the colouring transparent,\tsk the drawing}
\stick{not amiss;\tsk or to speak more like a man} 
\stick{of science,\tsk and measure my piece in the} 
\stick{painter’s scale, divided into 20,\tsk I be-}
\stick{lieve, my Lord, the out-lines will turn}
\stick{out as 12,\tsk the composition as 9,\tsk the} 
\stick{colouring as 6,\tsk the expression 13 and} 
\stick{a half,\tsk and the design,\tsk if I may be} 
\stick{allowed, my Lord, to understand my own}
\stick{\i{design}, and supposing absolute perfecti-}
\stick{on in designing, to be as 20,\tsk I think it} 
\stick{cannot well fall short of 19. Besides}
\stick{all this,\tsk there is keeping in it, and}
\catch{the} 
\stick{the dark strokes in the \s{Hobby-Horse},}
\stick{(which is a secondary figure, and a kind} 
\stick{of back-ground to the whole) give great} 
\stick{force to the principal lights in your own} 
\stick{figure, and make it come off wonder-}
\stick{fully;\tsk and besides, there is an air of}
originality in the \i{tout ensemble}.

Be pleased, my good Lord, to order\break
\stick{the sum to be paid into the hands of Mr.}
\stick{\i{Dodsley}, for the benefit of the author;} 
\stick{and in the next edition care shall be ta-}
\stick{ken that this chapter be expunged, and}

\stick{\i{tandum}, and whatever else in this book} 
\stick{relates to \s{Hobby-Horses}, but no more,} 
\stick{shall stand dedicated to your Lordship.\tsk}
\stick{The rest I dedicate to the \s{Moon}, who, by}

\initial[findent=2pt, nindent=0pt]{W}{Hatever} 
degree of small merit,\break 
the act of benignity in favour of\break
\stick{the midwife, might justly claim, or in}
\stick{whom that claim truly rested,\tsk at first}
\stick{sight seems not very material to this}
\stick{history;\tsh certain however it was, that}
\stick{the gentlewoman, the parson’s wife, did}
\stick{run away at that time with the whole}
\stick{of it: And yet, for my life, I cannot help}
\stick{thinking but that the parson himself,}
\catch{tho’} 
\stick{tho’ he had not the good fortune to hit}
\stick{upon the design first,\tsk yet, as he heartily}
\stick{concurred in it the moment it was laid}
\stick{before him, and as heartily parted with}
\stick{his money to carry it into execution,} 
\stick{had a claim to some share of it,\tsk if not}
\stick{to a full half of whatever honour was}
due to it.

The world at that time was pleased to\break
determine the matter otherwise.

Lay down the book, and I will allow\break
\stick{you half a day to give a probable guess}
at the grounds of this procedure.

Be it known then, that, for about five\break
\stick{years before the date of the midwife’s} 
\stick{licence, of which you have had so cir-}
\stick{cumstantial an account,\tsk the parson we}
\stick{have to do with, had made himself a}
\catch{country-} 
\stick{country-talk by a breach of all decorum,} 
\stick{which he had committed against himself,}
\stick{his station, and his office;\tsk and that}
\stick{was, in never appearing better, or other-}
\stick{wise mounted, than upon a lean, sorry,}
\stick{jack-ass of a horse, value about one}
\stick{pound fifteen shillings; who, to shorten}
\stick{all description of him, was full brother to} 
\stick{\i{Rosinante}, as far as similitude congenial}
\stick{could make him; for he answered his}
\stick{description to a hair-breadth in every}
\stick{thing,\tsk except that I do not remember}
\stick{’tis any where said, that \i{Rosinante} was} 
\stck{broken winded; and that, moreover, \i{Rosi-}}
\stick{\i{nante}, as is the happiness of most \i{Spanish}} 
\stick{horses, fat or lean,\tsk was uudoubtedly\sic a} 
horse at all points.

I know very well that the \s{Hero}’s\break
\stick{horse was a horse of chaste deportment,} 
\stick{which may have given grounds for a}
\catch{con-} 
\stick{contrary opinion: But it is as certain at}
\stick{the same time, that \i{Rosinante’}s continen-}
\stick{cy (as may be demonstrated from the ad-}
\stick{venture of the \i{Yanguesian} carriers) pro-}
\stick{ceeded from no bodily defect or cause} 
\stick{whatsoever, but from the temperance} 
\stick{and orderly current of his blood.\tsk And}
\stick{let me tell you, Madam, there is a great}
\stick{deal of very good chastity in the world,}
\stick{in behalf of which you could not say}
more for your life.

Let that be as it may, as my purpose\break
\stick{is to do exact justice to every creature}
\stick{brought upon the stage of this dramatic}
\stick{work,\tsk I could not stifle this distinction}
\stick{in favour of Don \i{Quixote’}s horse;\tsh in}
\stick{all other points the parson’s horse, I say,}
\stick{was just such another,\tsk for he was as}
\stick{lean, and as lank, and as sorry a jade, as} 
\stick{\s{Humility} herself could have bestrided.}
\catch{In}
\stick{\indent In the estimation of here and there a}
\stick{man of weak judgment, it was greatly}
\stick{in the parson’s power to have helped the}
\stick{figure of this horse of his,\tsk for he was}
\stick{master of a very handsome demi-peak’d}
\stick{saddle, quilted on the seat with green} 
\stick{plush, garnished with a double row of} 
\stick{silver-headed studs, and a noble pair of} 
\stick{shining brass stirrups, with a housing al-}
\stick{together suitable, of grey superfine cloth,}
\stick{with an edging of black lace, termina-}
\stick{ting in a deep, black, silk fringe, \i{poudrè}}
\stick{\i{d’or},\tsk all which he had purchased in the}
\stick{pride and prime of his life, together with} 
\stick{a grand embossed bridle, ornamented at}
\stick{all points as it should be.\tsh But not}
\stick{caring to banter his beast, he had hung}
\stick{all these up behind his study door;\tsk and,}
\stick{in lieu of them, had seriously befitted}
\stick{him with just such a bridle and such}
\catch{a} 
\stick{a saddle, as the figure and value of such}
a steed might well and truly deserve.

In the several sallies about his parish,\break 
\stick{and in the neighbouring visits to the}
\stick{gentry who lived around him,\tsh you} 
\stick{will easily comprehend, that the parson,}
\stick{so appointed, would both hear and see}
\stick{enough to keep his philosophy from}
\stick{rusting. To speak the truth, he never}
\stick{could enter a village, but he caught the}
\stick{attention of both old and young.\tsh La-}
\stick{bour stood still as he pass’d,\tsh the bucket}
\stick{hung suspended in the middle of the}
\stick{well,\tsk the spinning-wheel forgot its}
\stick{round,\tsh even chuck-farthing and}
\stick{shuffle-cap themselves stood gaping till} 
\stick{he had got out of sight; and as his}
\stick{movement was not of the quickest, he}
\stick{had generally time enough upon his}
\stick{hands to make his observations,\tsk to hear}
\catch{the} 
\stick{the groans of the serious,\tsh and the}
\stick{laughter of the light-hearted;\tsk all which}
\stick{he bore with excellent tranquillity.\tsk His} 
\stick{character was,\tsk he loved a jest in his}
\stick{heart\tsk and as he saw himself in the true}
\stick{point of ridicule, he would say, he could} 
\stick{not be angry with others for seeing him}
\stick{in a light, in which he so strongly saw} 
\stick{himself: So that to his friends, who}
\stick{knew his foible was not the love of mo-}
\stick{ney, and who therefore made the less}
\stick{scruple in bantering the extravagance of}
\stick{his humour,\tsk instead of giving the true}
\stick{cause,\tsh he chose rather to join in the} 
\stick{laugh against himself; and as he never}
\stick{carried one single ounce of flesh upon his}
\stick{own bones, being altogether as spare a} 
\stick{figure as his beast,\tsk he would sometimes}
\stick{insist upon it, that the horse was as good}
\stick{as the rider deserved;\tsk that they were,}
\stick{centaur-like,\tsk both of a piece. At other}
\catch{times,}
\stick{times, and in other moods, when his}
\stick{spirits were above the temptation of false} 
\stick{wit,\tsk he would say, he found himself}
\stick{going off fast in a consumption; and,}
\stick{with great gravity, would pretend, he}
\stick{could not bear the sight of a fat horse}
\stick{without a dejection of heart, and a sensi-}
\stick{ble alteration in his pulse; and that he}
\stick{had made choice of the lean one he rode}
\stick{upon, not only to keep himself in coun-}
tenance, but in spirits.

At different times he would give fifty\break
\stick{humorous and opposite reasons for ri-}
\stick{ding a meek-spirited jade of a broken-}
\stick{winded horse, preferably to one of met-}
\stick{tle;\tsk for on such a one he could sit me-}
\stick{chanically, and meditate as delightfully} 
\stick{\i{de vanitate mundi et fugâ sæculi}, as with}
\stick{the advantage of a death’s head before} 
\stick{him;\tsk that, in all other exercitations, he}
\catch{could}
\stick{could spend his time, as he rode slowly}
\stick{along,\tsh to as much account as in his} 
\stick{study;\tsh that he could draw up an ar-}
\stick{gument in his sermon,\tsk or a hole in his} 
\stick{breeches, as steadily on the one as in the} 
\stick{other;\tsk that brisk trotting and slow ar-}
\stck{gumentation, like wit and judgment, were} 
\stick{two incompatible movements.\tsk But that}
\stck{upon his steed\tsk he could unite and recon-}
\stick{cile every thing,\tsk he could compose} 
\stick{his sermon,\tsk he could compose his} 
\stick{cough,\tsh and, in case nature gave a}
\stick{call that way, he could likewise compose} 
\stick{himself to sleep.\tsk In short, the parson}
\stick{upon such encounters would assign any}
\stick{cause, but the true cause,\tsk and he with-}
\stick{held the true one, only out of a nicety of}
\stick{temper, because he thought it did ho-}
nour to him.\patch[36pt]{But}

But the truth of the story was as fol-\break
\stick{lows: In the first years of this gentle-}
\stick{man’s life, and about the time when the} 
\stick{superb saddle and bridle were purchased} 
\stick{by him, it had been his manner, or va-}
\stick{nity, or call it what you will,\tsk to run}
\stick{into the opposite extream.\tsk In the lan-}
\stick{guage of the county where he dwelt, he}
\stick{was said to have loved a good horse, and}
\stick{generally had one of the best in the whole} 
\stick{parish standing in his stable always ready}
\stick{for saddling; and as the nearest midwife,}
\stick{as I told you, did not live nearer to the} 
\stick{village than seven miles, and in a vile}
\stick{country,\tsh it so fell out that the poor}
\stick{gentleman was scarce a whole week to-}
\stick{gether without some piteous application}
\stick{for his beast; and as he was not an un-}
\stick{kind-hearted man, and every case was} 
\stick{more pressing and more distressful than}
\stick{the last,\tsk as much as he loved his beast,}
\catch{he}
\stick{he had never a heart to refuse him; the} 
\stick{upshot of which was generally this, that} 
\stick{his horse was either clapp’d, or spavin’d,}
\stick{or greaz’d;\tsk or he was twitter-bon’d, or} 
\stick{broken-winded, or something, in short,} 
\stick{or other had befallen him which would} 
\stick{let him carry no flesh;\tsk so that he had}
\stick{every nine or ten months a bad horse to} 
\stick{get rid of,\tsk and a good horse to purchase} 
in his stead.

What the loss in such a balance might\break
\stk{amount to, \i{communibus annis}, I would leave}
\stick{to a special jury of sufferers in the same} 
\stick{traffic, to determine;\tsk but let it be what}
\stick{it would, the honest gentleman bore it}
\stick{for many years without a murmur, till} 
\stick{at length, by repeated ill accidents of the}
\stick{kind, he found it necessary to take the} 
\stick{thing under consideration; and upon}
\stick{weighing the whole, and summing it up}
\catch{in} 
\stick{in his mind, he found it not only dispro-}
\stick{portion’d to his other expences, but} 
\stick{withall so heavy an article in itself, as to} 
\stick{disable him from any other act of gene-}
\stick{rosity in his parish: Besides this he con-}
\stick{sidered, that with half the sum thus gal-}
\stick{loped away, he could do ten times as} 
\stick{much good;\tsh and what still weighed}
\stick{more with him than all other considera-}
\stick{tions put together, was this, that it con-}
\stick{fined all his charity into one particular}
\stick{channel, and where, as he fancied, it was} 
\stick{the least wanted, namely, to the child-}
\stick{bearing and child-getting part of his}
\stick{parish; reserving nothing for the impo-}
\stick{tent,\tsk nothing for the aged,\tsk nothing}
\stick{for the many comfortless scenes he was}
\stick{hourly called forth to visit, where po-} 
\stick{verty, and sickness, and affliction dwelt}\break
together.\patch[24pt]{For}

For these reasons he resolved to dis-
\stick{continue the expence; and there appear-}
\stick{ed but two possible ways to extricate} 
\stick{him clearly out of it;\tsk and these were,}
\stick{either to make it an irrevocable law ne-}
\stick{ver more to lend his steed upon any ap-}
\stick{plication whatever,\tsk or else be content} 
\stick{to ride the last poor devil, such as they}
\stick{had made him, with all his aches and in-}
\stick{firmities, to the very end of the chapter.}

As he dreaded his own constancy in\break 
\stick{the first,\tsk he very chearfully betook} 
\stick{himself to the second; and tho’ he could} 
\stick{very well have explain’d it, as I said, to}
\stick{his honour,\tsk yet, for that very reason, he}
\stick{had a spirit above it; choosing rather to}
\stick{bear the contempt of his enemies, and} 
\stick{the laughter of his friends, than undergo}
\stick{the pain of telling a story, which might} 
seem a panegyric upon himself.\patch[24pt]{I}

I have the highest idea of the spiritual\break
\stick{and refined sentiments of this reverend}
\stick{gentleman, from this single stroke in his}
\stick{character, which I think comes up to any}
\stick{of the honest refinements of the peerless}
\stick{knight of \i{La Mancha}, whom, by the}
\stick{bye, with all his follies, I love more, and} 
\stick{would actually have gone further to have}
\stick{paid a visit to, than the greatest hero of}
antiquity.

But this is not the moral of my story:\break
\stick{The thing I had in view was to shew the}
\stick{temper of the world in the whole of this}
\stick{affair.\tsk For you must know, that so long}
\stick{as this explanation would have done the} 
\stick{parson credit,\tsk the devil a soul could find}
\stick{it out,\tsk I suppose his enemies would not,}
\stick{and that his friends could not.\tsh But} 
\stick{no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf}
\stick{of the midwife, and pay the expences of}
\catch{the} 
\stick{the ordinary’s licence to set her up,\tsk but}
\stick{the whole secret came out; every horse}
\stick{he had lost, and two horses more than}
\stick{ever he had lost, with all the circum-}
\stick{stances of their destruction, were known}
\stick{and distinctly remembered.\tsk The story}
\stick{ran like wild-fire.\tsk\lqq The parson had}
\stick{\lqq a returning fit of pride which had just}
\stick{\lqq seized him; and he was going to be}
\stick{\lqq well mounted once again in his life;}
\stick{\lqq and if it was so, ’twas plain as the sun}
\stick{\lqq at noon-day, he would pocket the ex-}
\stick{\lqq pence of the licence, ten times told the}
\stick{\lqq very first year:\tsh so that every body}
\stick{\lqq was left to judge what were his views}
\lqq in this act of charity.\/”

What were his views in this, and in\break
\stick{every other action of his life,\tsk or rather}
\stick{what were the opinions which floated in}
\stick{the brains of other people concerning it,}
\catch{was}
\stick{was a thought which too much floated in}
\stick{his own, and too often broke in upon his} 
\stick{rest, when he should have been sound} 
asleep.

About ten years ago this gentleman\break
\stick{had the good fortune to be made entirely}
\stick{easy upon that score,\tsh it being just so}
\stick{long since he left his parish,\tsh and the} 
\stick{whole world at the same time behind}
\stick{him,\tsk and stands accountable to a judge}
\stick{of whom he will have no cause to com-}
plain.

But there is a fatality attends the ac-\break
\stick{tions of some men: Order them as they}
\stick{will, they pass thro’ a certain medium}
\stick{which so twists and refracts them from} 
\stick{their true directions\tsh that, with}
\stick{all the titles to praise which a rectitude}
\stick{of heart can give, the doers of them are}
\catch{ne-} 
\stick{nevertheless forced to live and die with-}
out it.

\dropcaptight{Y}{orick} was this parson’s name, and,\break
what is very remarkable in it, (as\break
\stick{appears from a most antient account of}
\stick{the family, wrote upon strong vellum,}
\catch{and}
\stick{and now in perfect preservation) it had}
\stick{been exactly so spelt for near,\tsk I was}
\stick{within an ace of saying nine hundred}
\stick{years;\tsh but I would not shake my}
\stick{credit in telling an improbable truth,}
\stick{however indisputable in itself;\tsh and}
\stick{therefore I shall content myself with on-}
\stick{ly saying,\tsh It had been exactly so spelt,}
\stick{without the least variation or transposi-}
\stick{tion of a single letter, for I do not know}
\stick{how long; which is more than I would} 
\stick{venture to say of one half of the best sur-}
\stck{names in the kingdom; which, in a course} 
\stick{of years, have generally undergone as}
\stick{many chops and changes as their own-}
\stick{ers.\tsk Has this been owing to the pride,}
\stick{or to the shame of the respective propri-}
\stick{etors?\tsk In honest truth, I think, some-}
\stick{times to the one, and sometimes to the} 
\stck{other, just as the temptation has wrought.} 
\stick{But a villainous affair it is, and will one}
\catch{day} 
\stck{day so blend and confound us all together,}
\stick{that no one shall be able to stand up and}
\stick{swear, \lqq That his own great grand fa-}
\stick{\lqq ther was the man who did either this}
\lqq or that.\,” 

This evil had been sufficiently fenced 
\stick{against by the prudent care of the \i{Yorick}’s}
\stick{family, and their religious preservation} 
\stick{of these records I quote, which do fur-}
\stick{ther inform us, That the family was ori-}
\stck{ginally of \i{Danish} extraction, and had been}
\stick{transplanted into \i{England} as early as in}
\stick{the reign of \i{Horwendillus}, king of \i{Den}-}
\stck{\i{mark}, in whose court it seems, an ancestor} 
\stick{of this Mr.\@ \i{Yorick}’s, and from whom he}
\stick{was lineally descended, held a consider-}
\stick{able post to the day of his death. Of what}
\stick{nature this considerable post was, this}
\stick{record saith not;\tsk it only adds, That,}
\stick{for near two centuries, it had been totally}
\catch{abo-} 
\stick{abolished as altogether unnecessary, not}
\stick{only in that court, but in every other} 
court of the Christian world.

It has often come into my head, that\break
\stick{this post could be no other than that of}
\stick{the king’s chief Jester;\tsk and that \i{Ham}-}
\stick{\i{let}’s \i{Yorick}, in our \i{Shakespear}, many of}
\stick{whose plays, you know, are founded up-}
\stck{on authenticated facts,\tsk was certainly the} 
very man.

I have not the time to look into \i{Saxo}-\break
\stick{\i{Grammaticus}’s \i{Danish} history, to know} 
\stick{the certainty of this;\tsk but if you have} 
\stick{leisure, and can easily get at the book,} 
you may do it full as well yourself.

I had just time, in my travels through\break
\stick{\i{Denmark} with Mr.\@ \i{Noddy}’s eldest son,}
\stick{whom, in the year 1741, I accompanied}
\catch{as}
\stick{as governor, riding along with him at a}
\stck{prodigious rate thro’ most parts of \i{Europe},}
\stick{and of which original journey perform’d} 
\stick{by us two, a most delectable narrative} 
\stick{will be given in the progress of this work.}
\stick{I had just time, I say, and that was all, to} 
\stick{prove the truth of an observation made} 
\stick{by a long sojourner in that country;\tsh}
\stick{namely, \lqq That nature was neither very} 
\stick{lavish, nor was she very stingy in her}
\stick{gifts of genius and capacity to its inha-}
\stick{bitants;\tsk but, like a discreet parent, was}
\stick{moderately kind to them all; observing} 
\stick{such an equal tenor in the distribution of} 
\stick{her favours, as to bring them, in those}
\stick{points, pretty near to a level with each} 
\stick{other; so that you will meet with few in-}
\stick{stances in that kingdom of refin’d parts;}
\stick{but a great deal of good plain houshold}
\stick{understanding amongst all ranks of}
\catch{people,}
\stck{people, of which every body has a share;\/”}
which is, I think, very right.

With us, you see, the case is quite\break
\stick{different;\tsk we are all ups and downs in} 
\stick{this matter;\tsk you are a great genius;\tsk}
\stick{or ’tis fifty to one, Sir, you are a great}
\stick{dunce and a blockhead;\tsk not that there}
\stick{is a total want of intermediate steps,\tsk}
\stck{no,\tsk we are not so irregular as that comes}
\stick{to;\tsk but the two extremes are more}
\stick{common, and in a greater degree in this}
\stck{unsettled island, where nature, in her gifts}
\stick{and dispositions of this kind, is most} 
\stick{whimsical and capricious; fortune her-}
\stick{self not being more so in the bequest of}
her goods and chattels than she.

This is all that ever stagger’d my faith\break
\stick{in regard to \i{Yorick}’s extraction, who, by} 
\stick{what I can remember of him, and by all}
\catch{the} 
\stick{the accounts I could ever get of him,}
\stick{seem’d not to have had one single drop}
\stick{of \i{Danish} blood in his whole crasis; in}
\stck{nine hundred years, it might possibly have}
\stick{all run out:\tsh I will not philosophize}
\stick{one moment with you about it; for hap-}
\stick{pen how it would, the fact was this:\tsk} 
\stick{That instead of that cold phlegm and}
\stck{exact regularity of sense and humours, you}
\stick{would have look’d for, in one so extract-}
\stick{ed;\tsk he was, on the contrary, as mer-}
\stick{curial and sublimated a composition,\tsk}
\stick{as heteroclite a creature in all his declen-}
\stick{sions;\tsk with as much life and whim,} 
\stick{and \i{gaité de cœur} about him, as the kind-}
\stick{liest climate could have engendered and} 
\stick{put together. With all this sail, poor}
\stick{\i{Yorick} carried not one ounce of ballast;}
\stick{he was utterly unpractised in the world;}
\stick{and, at the age of twenty-six, knew just}
\stick{about as well how to steer his course}
\catch{in} 
\stick{in it, as a romping, unsuspicious girl of} 
\stick{thirteen: So that upon his first setting} 
\stick{out, the brisk gale of his spirits, as you} 
\stick{will imagine, ran him foul ten times in}
\stick{a day of some body’s tackling; and as}
\stick{the grave and more slow-paced were} 
\stick{oftenest in his way,\tsh you may like-}
\stick{wise imagine, ’twas with such he had} 
\stick{generally the ill luck to get the most en-}
\stick{tangled. For aught I know there might}
\stick{be some mixture of unlucky wit at the} 
\stick{bottom of such \i{Fracas:}\tsk For, to speak} 
\stick{the truth, \i{Yorick} had an invincible dis-}
\stick{like and opposition in his nature to gra-}
\stick{vity;\tsh not to gravity as such;\tsh for}
\stick{where gravity was wanted, he would be}
\stick{the most grave or serious of mortal men} 
\stick{for days and weeks together;\tsk but he} 
\stick{was an enemy to the affectation of it,} 
\stick{and declared open war against it, only as} 
\stick{it appeared a cloak for ignorance, or for}
\catch{folly:\sic}
\stick{folly; and then, whenever it fell in his}
\stick{way, however sheltered and protected,}
he seldom gave it much quarter.

Sometimes, in his wild way of talking,\break
\stick{he would say, That gravity was an errant}
\stick{scoundrel; and he would add,\tsk of the}
\stick{most dangerous kind too,\tsk because a}
\stick{sly one; and that, he verily believed,} 
\stick{more honest, well-meaning people were}
\stick{bubbled out of their goods and money}
\stick{by it in one twelve-month, than by}
\stick{pocket-picking and shop-lifting in seven.}
\stick{In the naked temper which a merry heart}
\stick{discovered, he would say, There was no}
\stick{danger,\tsk but to itself:\tsk whereas the very} 
\stick{essence of gravity was design, and con-}
\stick{sequently deceit;\tsk ’twas a taught trick}
\stick{to gain credit of the world for more sense}
\stick{and knowledge than a man was worth;} 
\stick{and that, with all its pretensions,\tsk it was}
\catch{no}
\stick{no better, but often worse, than what a} 
\stick{\i{French} wit had long ago defined it,\tsk\i{viz}.} 
\stick{\i{A mysterious carriage of the body to cover}}
\stick{\i{the defects of the mind};\tsk which definition} 
\stick{of gravity, \i{Yorick}, with great imprudence,} 
\stick{would say, deserved to be wrote in let-}
ters of gold.

But, in plain truth, he was a man un-\break
\stick{hackneyed and unpractised in the world,}
\stick{and was altogether as indiscreet and}
\stck{foolish on every other subject of discourse} 
\stick{where policy is wont to impress restraint.} 
\stick{\i{Yorick} had no impression but one, and}
\stick{that was what arose from the nature of} 
\stick{the deed spoken of; which impression he} 
\stick{would usually translate into plain \i{English}}
\stick{without any periphrasis,\tsk and too} 
\stick{oft without much distinction of either}
\stick{personage, time, or place;\tsk so that when}
\stick{mention was made of a pitiful or an}
\catch{un-} 
\stick{ungenerous proceeding,\tsh he never gave}
\stick{himself a moment’s time to reflect who} 
\stick{was the Hero of the piece,\tsh what his}
\stick{station,\tsh or how far he had power to}
\stick{hurt him hereafter;\tsk but if it was a dirty}
\stick{action,\tsh without more ado,\tsh The}
\stick{man was a dirty fellow,\tsk and so on:\tsk}
\stick{And as his comments had usually the ill} 
\stick{fate to be terminated either in a \i{bon mot},} 
\stick{or to be enliven’d throughout with some} 
\stick{drollery or humour of expression, it gave} 
\stick{wings to \i{Yorick}’s indiscretion. In a word,}
\stick{tho’ he never sought, yet, at the same}
\stick{time, as he seldom shun’d occasions of} 
\stick{saying what came uppermost, and with-}
\stick{out much ceremony;\tsk he had but too}
\stick{many temptations in life, of scattering} 
\stick{his wit and his humour,\tsk his gibes and} 
\stick{his jests about him.\tsh They were not}
lost for want of gathering.\patch[21pt]{What}

What were the consequences, and\break 
\stick{what was \i{Yorick}’s catastrophe thereup-}
on, you will read in the next chapter.

\chap{XII}{24pt}{8pt}

\dropcap{T}{he} \i{Mortgager} and \i{Mortgagée}\break 
differ the one from the other, not\break
\stick{more in length of purse, than the \i{Jester}} 
\stick{and \i{Jestée} do, in that of memory. But}
\stick{in this the comparison between them}
\stick{runs, as the scholiasts call it, upon all-}
\stick{four; which, by the bye, is upon one}
\stick{or two legs more, than some of the best}
\stick{of \i{Homer}’s can pretend to;\tsk namely,} 
\stick{That the one raises a sum and the other}
\stick{a laugh at your expence, and think no} 
\stick{more about it. Interest, however, still}
\stick{runs on in both cases;\tsk the periodical} 
\stick{or accidental payments of it, just serving}
\catch{to} 
\stick{to keep the memory of the affair alive;} 
\stick{till, at length, in some evil hour,\tsk pop}
\stick{comes the creditor upon each, and by}
\stick{demanding principal upon the spot, to-}
\stick{gether with full interest to the very day,} 
\stick{makes them both feel the full extent of} 
their obligations.

As the reader (for I hate your \i{ifs}) has\break
\stick{a thorough knowledge of human nature,}
\stick{I need not say more to satisfy him, that}
\stick{my Hero could not go on at this rate} 
\stick{without some slight experience of these} 
\stick{incidental mementos. To speak the}
\stick{truth, he had wantonly involved himself}
\stick{in a multitude of small book-debts of}
\stick{this stamp, which, notwithstanding \i{Eu}-}
\stick{\i{genius}’s frequent advice, he too much} 
\stick{disregarded; thinking, that as not one}
\stick{of them was contracted thro’ any malig-}
\stick{nancy;\tsk but, on the contrary, from an}
\catch{honesty} 
\stick{honesty of mind, and a mere jocundity}
\stick{of humour, they would all of them be} 
cross’d out in course.

\i{Eugenius} would never admit this; and\break
\stick{would often tell him, that one day or} 
\stick{other he would certainly be reckoned}
\stick{with; and he would often add, in an ac-}
\stick{cent of sorrowful apprehension,\tsk to the}
\stick{uttermost mite. To which \i{Yorick}, with}
\stick{his usual carelessness of heart, would as}
\stick{often answer with a pshaw!\tsk and if the} 
\stick{subject was started in the fields,\tsk with a} 
\stick{hop, skip, and a jump, at the end of it;} 
\stick{but if close pent up in the social chimney} 
\stick{corner, where the culprit was barrica-}
\stick{do’d in, with a table and a couple of} 
\stick{arm chairs, and could not so readily fly}
\stick{off in a tangent,\tsk \i{Eugenius} would then} 
\stick{go on with his lecture upon discretion, in}
\catch{words}
\stick{words to this purpose, though somewhat}
better put together.

Trust me, dear \i{Yorick}, this unwary\break 
\stick{pleasantry of thine will sooner or later}
\stick{bring thee into scrapes and difficulties,}
\stick{which no after-wit can extricate thee out}
\stick{of.\tsh In these sallies, too oft, I see, it}
\stick{happens, that a person laugh’d at, con-}
\stick{siders himself in the light of a person in-}
\stick{jured, with all the rights of such a situa-}
\stick{tion belonging to him; and when thou}
\stick{viewest him in that light too, and rec-}
\stick{kons up his friends, his family, his kin-}
\stick{dred and allies,\tsk and musters up with} 
\stick{them the many recruits which will list}
\stick{under him from a sense of common dan-}
\stick{ger;\tsk ’tis no extravagant arithmetic to}
\stick{say, that for every ten jokes,\tsk thou hast}
\stick{got a hundred enemies; and till thou}
\stck{hast gone on, and raised a swarm of wasps}
\catch{about} 
\stick{about thine ears, and art half stung to}
\stick{death by them, thou wilt never be con-}
vinced it is so.

I cannot suspect it in the man whom I\break
\stick{esteem, that there is the least spur from} 
\stick{spleen or malevolence of intent in these}
\stick{sallies.\tsh I believe and know them to}
\stick{be truly honest and sportive:\tsk But con-}
\stick{sider, my dear lad, that fools cannot di-}
\stick{stinguish this,\tsk and that knaves will not;} 
\stick{and thou knowest not what it is, either} 
\stick{to provoke the one, or to make merry} 
\stick{with the other,\tsk whenever they associate}
\stick{for mutual defence, depend upon it, they}
\stick{will carry on the war in such a manner} 
\stick{against thee, my dear friend, as to make} 
thee heartily sick of it, and of thy life too.

\patch[24pt]{\i{Yorick}}

\i{Yorick} scarce ever heard this sad va-\break
\stick{ticination of his destiny read over to him,} 
\stick{but with a tear stealing from his eye, and} 
\stick{a promissory look attending it, that he}
\stick{was resolved, for the time to come, to}
\stick{ride his tit with more sobriety.\tsh But,}
\stick{alas, too late!\tsk a grand confederacy,}
\stick{with \astv\ and \astv\ at the  head of} 
\stick{it, was form’d before the first prediction} 
\stick{of it.\tsk The whole plan of the attack,} 
\stick{just as \i{Eugenius} had foreboded, was put}
\stick{in execution all at once,\tsk with so little} 
\stick{mercy on the side of the allies,\tsk and so} 
\stick{little suspicion in \i{Yorick}, of what was} 
\stick{carrying on against him,\tsk that when he} 
\stick{thought, good easy man! full surely pre-}
\stick{ferment was o’ripening,\tsk they had smote}
\stick{his root, and then he fell, as many a} 
worthy man had fallen before him.
\patch[24pt]{\i{Yorick},}

\i{Yorick}, however, fought it out with all\break
\stick{imaginable gallantry for some time; till,} 
\stick{over-power’d by numbers, and worn} 
\stick{out at length by the calamities of the} 
\stick{war,\tsk but more so, by the ungenerous}
\stick{manner in which it was carried on,\tsk he}
\stick{threw down the sword; and though he} 
\stick{kept up his spirits in appearance to the}
\stick{last,\tsk he died, nevertheless, as was gene-}
rally thought, quite broken hearted.

What inclined \i{Eugenius} to the same\break
opinion, was as follows:

A few hours before \i{Yorick} breath’d\break
\stick{his last, \i{Eugenius} stept in with an intent}
\stick{to take his last sight and last farewell of} 
\stick{him: Upon his drawing \i{Yorick}’s cur-}
\stick{tain, and asking how he felt himself,}
\stick{\i{Yorick}, looking up in his face, took hold}
\stick{of his hand,\tsk and, after thanking him}
\catch{for}
\stick{for the many tokens of his friendship to} 
\stick{him, for which, he said, if it was their}
\stick{fate to meet hereafter,\tsk he would thank}
\stick{him again and again.\tsk He told him, he} 
\stick{was within a few hours of giving his} 
\stick{enemies the slip for ever.\tsk I hope not,}
\stick{answered \i{Eugenius}, with tears trickling}
\stick{down his cheeks, and with the tenderest}
\stick{tone that ever man spoke,\tsk I hope not,}
\stick{\i{Yorick}, said he.\tsk \i{Yorick} replied, with a} 
\stick{look up, and a gentle squeeze of \i{Eu-}}
\stick{\i{genius}’s hand, and that was all,\tsk but it}
\stick{cut \i{Eugenius} to his heart.\tsk Come,\tsk}
\stick{come, \i{Yorick}, quoth \i{Eugenius}, wiping} 
\stick{his eyes, and summoning up the man}
\stick{within him,\tsk my dear lad, be comfort-}
\stick{ed,\tsk let not all thy spirits and fortitude}
\stick{forsake thee at this crisis when thou most} 
\stick{wants them;\tsh who knows what re-}
\stick{sources are in store, and what the power}
\stick{of God may yet do for thee?\tsh \i{Yorick}}
\catch{laid}
\stick{laid his hand upon his heart, and gently}
\stick{shook his head;\tsk for my part, continu-}
\stick{ed \i{Eugenius}, crying bitterly as he uttered} 
\stick{the words,\tsk I declare I know not, \i{Yo}-}
\stick{\i{rick}, how to part with thee,\tsk and} 
\stick{would gladly flatter my hopes, added}
\stick{\i{Eugenius}, chearing up his voice, that}
\stick{there is still enough left of thee to make}
\stick{a bishop,\tsk and that I may live to see} 
\stick{it.\tsk I beseech thee, \i{Eugenius}, quoth}
\stick{\i{Yorick}, taking off his night-cap as well} 
\stick{as he could with his left hand,\tsk his}
\stick{right being still grasped close in that of}
\stick{\i{Eugenius},\tsk I beseech thee to take a}
\stick{view of my head.\tsk I see nothing that}
\stick{ails it, replied \i{Eugenius.} Then, alas!}
\stick{my friend, said \i{Yorick}, let me tell you,}
\stck{that ’tis so bruised and mis-shapen’d with}
\stick{the blows which \astv\ and \astv,}
\stick{and some others have so unhandsomely}
\stick{given me in the dark, that I might say}
\catch{with} 
\stick{with \i{Sancho Pança}, that should I reco-} 
\stick{ver, and \lqq Mitres thereupon be suffer’d}
\stick{\lqq to rain down from heaven as thick as}
\stick{\lqq hail, not one of ’em would fit it.\,”\tsh}
\stick{\i{Yorick}’s last breath was hanging upon}
\stick{his trembling lips ready to depart as he} 
\stick{uttered this;\tsk yet still it was utter’d} 
\stick{with something of a \i{cervantick} tone;\tsk}
\stick{and as he spoke it, \i{Eugenius} could per-}
\stick{ceive a stream of lambent fire lighted up}
\stick{for a moment in his eyes;\tsk faint picture}
\stick{of those flashes of his spirit, which (as} 
\stck{\i{Shakespear} said of his ancestor) were wont} 
to set the table in a roar!

\i{Eugenius} was convinced from this,\break
\stick{that the heart of his friend was broke;}
\stick{he squeez’d his hand,\tsk and then}
\stick{walk’d softly out of the room, weeping}
\stick{as he walk’d. \i{Yorick} followed \i{Eugenius}}
\stick{with his eyes to the door,\tsk he then}
\catch{closed}
\stick{closed them,\tsk and never opened them}
more.

He lies buried in the corner of his\break
\stick{church-yard, in the parish of \tsfill,} 
\stick{under a plain marble slabb, which his} 
\stick{friend \i{Eugenius}, by leave of his executors,} 
\stick{laid upon his grave, with no more than}

both for his epitaph and elegy.

But in order to put a stop to the prac-\break

\catch{nature}
\stick{nature too manifestly opened a door to,} 
\stck{and which indeed had never been thought}

\stick{\lqq effectual a manner, as if such a co-}

\stick{more than what was reasonable;\tsk and}
\stick{yet, as reasonable as it was, I have ever}
\stick{thought it hard that the whole weight of} 
\stick{the article should have fallen entirely, as}
it did, upon myself.
\patch[7pt]{But}

But I was begot and born to misfor-\break
\stick{tunes;\tsk  for my poor mother, whether}
\stick{it was wind or water,\tsk or a compound}
\stick{of both,\tsk or neither;\tsk or whether it}
\stick{was simply the mere swell of imagination}
\stick{and fancy in her;\tsk or how far a strong}
\stick{wish and desire to have it so, might mis-}
\stick{lead her judgment;\tsk in short, whether}
\stick{she was deceived or deceiving in this}
\stick{matter, it no way becomes me to decide.} 
\stick{The fact was this, That, in the latter end} 
\stick{of \i{September}, 1717, which was the year} 
\stick{before I was born, my mother having}
\stick{carried my father up to town much} 
\stick{against the grain,\tsk he peremptorily in-}
\stick{sisted upon the clause;\tsk so that I was}
\stick{doom’d, by marriage articles, to have} 
\stick{my nose squeez’d as flat to my face, as if} 
\stick{the destinies had actually spun me with-}
out one.
\patch[14pt]{How}

How this event came about,\tsk and\break
\stick{what a train of vexatious disappoint-}
\stick{ments, in one stage or other of my life,} 
\stick{have pursued me from the mere loss, or} 
\stick{rather compression, of this one single}
\stick{member,\tsk shall be laid before the rea-}
der all in due time.

\chap{XVI}{28pt}{10pt}

\dropcap{M}{y} father, as any body may natu-\break
rally imagine, came down with\break
\stick{my mother into the country, in but a} 
\stick{pettish kind of a humour. The first}
\stick{twenty or five-and-twenty miles he did}
\stick{nothing in the world but fret and teaze}
\stck{himself, and indeed my mother too, about}
\stick{the cursed expence, which he said might}
\stick{every shilling of it have been saved;\tsk}
\stick{then what vexed him more than every}
\catch{thing}
\stick{thing else was the provoking time of the}
\stick{year,\tsh which, as I told you, was to-} 
\stick{wards the end of \i{September}, when his} 
\stick{wall-fruit, and green gages especially, in} 
\stick{which he was very curious, were just} 
\stick{ready for pulling:\tsh \lqq Had he been}
\stick{\lqq whistled up to \i{London}, upon a \i{Tom}}
\stick{\lqq \i{Fool}’s errand in any other month of}
\stick{\lqq the whole year, he should not have}
\lqq said three words about it.\,”

For the next two whole stages, no\break
\stick{subject would go down, but the heavy} 
\stick{blow he had sustain’d from the loss of a}
\stick{son, whom it seems he had fully reckon’d} 
\stick{upon in his mind, and register’d down} 
\stick{in his pocket-book, as a second staff for}
\stick{his old age, in case \i{Bobby} should fail him.}
\stick{\lqq The disappointment of this, he said,}
\stick{\lqq was ten times more to a wise man than}
\stick{\lqq all the money which the journey, \et\i{c}.}
\catch{\lqq had}
\stick{\lqq had cost him, put together,\tsk rot the}
\stick{\lqq hundred and twenty pounds,\tsh he}
\stick{\lqq did not mind it a rush.\,”\hfill}

From \i{Stilton}, all the way to \i{Grantham},\break
\stick{nothing in the whole affair provoked}
\stick{him so much as the condolences of his}
\stck{friends, and the foolish figure they should}
\stick{both make at church, the first \i{Sunday};}
\stick{\tsk of which, in the satirical vehemence} 
\stick{of his wit, now sharpen’d a little by vex-}
\stick{ation, he would give so many humorous}
\stick{and provoking descriptions,\tsk and place} 
\stick{his rib and self in so many tormenting} 
\stick{lights and attitudes in the face of the}
\stick{whole congregation;\tsk that my mother}
\stick{declared, these two stages were so truly} 
\stick{tragi-comical, that she did nothing but} 
\stick{laugh and cry in a breath, from one end} 
to the other of them all the way.
\patch[14pt]{From}

From \i{Grantham}, till they had cross’d\break
\stick{the \i{Trent}, my father was out of all kind}
\stick{of patience at the vile trick and impo-}
\stick{sition which he fancied my mother had} 
\stick{put upon him in this affair.\tsk \lqq Certainly,}
\stick{he would say to himself, over and over} 
\stick{again, \lqq the woman could not be decei-}
\stick{ved herself;\tsh if she could,\tsh} 
\stick{what weakness!\tsk tormenting word!}
\stick{which led his imagination a thorny}
\stick{dance, and, before all was over, play’d}
\stick{the duce and all with him;”\tsh for}
\stick{sure as ever the word \i{weakness} was ut-}
\stick{tered, and struck full upon his brain,\tsh}
\stick{so sure it set him upon running divi-}
\stick{sions upon how many kinds of weak-}
\stick{nesses there were;\tsh that there was} 
\stick{such a thing as weakness of the body,}
\stick{\tsh as well as weakness of the mind,\tsk}
\stick{and then he would do nothing but syl-}
\stick{logize within himself for a stage or two}
\catch{to-}
\stick{together, How far the cause of all these}
\stick{vexations might, or might not, have}
arisen out of himself.

In short, he had so many little subjects\break
\stick{of disquietude springing out of this one}
\stick{affair, all fretting successively in his}
\stick{mind as they rose up in it, that my mo-}
\stick{ther, whatever was her journey up, had} 
\stick{but an uneasy journey of it down.\tsh}
\stick{In a word, as she complained to my un-}

\stick{years in the parish, brought every mo-}
\stick{ther’s son of them into the world with-}
\stick{out any one slip or accident which could} 
fairly be laid to her account.

\tight{These facts, tho’ they had their weight,}\break
\stick{yet did not altogether satisfy some few}
\stick{scruples and uneasinesses which hung}
\stick{upon my father’s spirits in relation to this} 
\stick{choice.\tsk To say nothing of the natural}
\stick{workings of humanity and justice,\tsk or of}
\stick{the yearnings of parental and connubial} 
\stick{love, all which prompted him to leave} 
\stick{as little to hazard as possible in a case of}
\stick{this kind;\tsh he felt himself concern’d}
\stick{in a particular manner, that all should} 
\stick{go right in the present case;\tsk from the}
\catch{ac-}
\stick{accumulated sorrow he lay open to,}
\stick{should any evil betide his wife and child} 
\stick{in lying-in at \i{Shandy-Hall}.\tsh He knew}
\stick{the world judged by events, and would} 
\stick{add to his afflictions in such a misfortune,}
\stick{by loading him with the whole blame of}
\stick{it.\tsh \lqq Alas o’day;\tsk had Mrs.\@ \i{Shandy},}
\stick{\lqq poor gentlewoman! had but her wish}
\stick{\lqq in going up to town just to lye-in and}
\stick{\lqq come down again;\tsk which, they say,}
\stick{\lqq she begg’d and pray’d for upon her}
\stick{\lqq bare knees,\tsh and which, in my opi-}
\stick{\lqq nion, considering the fortune which}
\stick{\lqq Mr.\@ \i{Shandy} got with her,\tsk was no such}
\stick{\lqq mighty matter to have complied with,}
\stick{\lqq the lady and her babe might both of}
\lqq ’em have been alive at this hour.”

This exclamation, my father knew\break 
\stick{was unanswerable;\tsk and yet, it was} 
\stick{not merely to shelter himself,\tsk nor was}
\catch{it}
\stick{it altogether for the care of his offspring} 
\stick{and wife that he seem’d so extremely} 
\stick{anxious about this point;\tsk my father}
\stick{had extensive views of things,\tsh and} 
\stick{stood, moreover, as he thought, deeply} 
\stick{concern’d in it for the publick good,} 
\stick{from the dread he entertained of the}
\stick{bad uses an ill-fated instance might be}
put to.

He was very sensible that all political\break
\stck{writers upon the subject had unanimously} 
\stick{agreed and lamented, from the begin-}
\stick{ning of Queen \i{Elizabeth}’s reign down} 
\stick{to his own time, that the current of men} 
\stick{and money towards the metropolis, up-}
\stick{on one frivolous errand or another,\tsk}
\stick{set in so strong,\tsk as to become dange-}
\stick{rous to our civil rights;\tsk tho’, by the}
\stick{bye,\tsh a \i{current} was not the image he}
\stick{took most delight in,\tsk a \i{distemper} was}
\catch{here}
\stick{here his favourite metaphor, and he}
\stick{would run it down into a perfect allego-}
\stick{ry, by maintaining it was identically the}
\stick{same in the body national as in the body}
\stick{natural, where blood and spirits were}
\stick{driven up into the head faster than they}
\stick{could find their ways down;\tsh a stop-}
\stick{page of circulation must ensue, which}
was death in both cases.

There was little danger, he would say,\break
\stick{of losing our liberties by \i{French} politicks}
\stick{or \i{French} invasions;\tsh nor was he so} 
\stick{much in pain of a consumption from} 
\stick{the mass of corrupted matter and ulce-}
\stick{rated humours in our constitution,\tsh}
\stick{which he hoped was not so bad as it was}
\stick{imagined;\tsk but he verily feared, that} 
\stick{in some violent push, we should go off,} 
\stick{all at once, in a state-apoplexy;\tsk and}
\catch{then}
\stick{then he would say, \i{The Lord have mercy}}
\i{upon us all}.

My father was never able to give the\break
\stick{history of this distemper,\tsk without the} 
remedy along with it.

\lqq Was I an absolute prince, he would\break
\stick{say, pulling up his breeches with both}
\stick{his hands, as he rose from his arm-chair,}
\stick{\lqq I would appoint able judges, at every}
\stick{\lqq avenue of my metropolis, who should}
\stick{\lqq take cognizance of every fool’s busi-}
\stick{\lqq ness who came there;\tsk and if, upon}
\stick{\lqq a fair and candid hearing, it appeared}
\stick{\lqq not of weight sufficient to leave his}
\stick{\lqq own home, and come up, bag and}
\stick{\lqq baggage, with his wife and children,}
\stick{\lqq farmers sons, \etc \etc at his backside,}
\stick{\lqq they should be all sent back, from}
\stick{\lqq constable to constable, like vagrants}
\catch{\lqq as} 
\stick{\lqq as they were, to the place of their le-}
\stick{\lqq gal settlements. By this means I shall}
\stick{\lqq take care, that my metropolis totter’d}
\stick{\lqq not thro’ its own weight;\tsk that the}
\stick{\lqq head be no longer too big for the bo-}
\stick{\lqq dy;\tsk that the extreams, now wasted}
\stick{\lqq and pin’d in, be restored to their due}
\stick{\lqq share of nourishment, and regain, with}
\stick{\lqq it, their natural strength and beauty:\tsk}
\stick{\lqq I would effectually provide, That the}
\stick{\lqq meadows and corn-fields, of my do-}
\stick{\lqq minions, should laugh and sing;\tsk}
\stick{\lqq that good chear and hospitality flou-}
\stick{\lqq rish once more;\tsk and that such weight}
\stick{\lqq and influence be put thereby into the}
\stick{\lqq hands of the Squirality of my king-}
\stick{\lqq dom, as should counterpoise what I}
\stick{\lqq perceive my Nobility are now taking}
\lqq from them.
\patch[28pt]{\lqq Why}

\lqq Why are there so few palaces and\break
\stick{\lqq gentlemen’s seats, he would ask, with}
\stick{some emotion, as he walked a-cross the}
\stick{room, \lqq throughout so many delicious}
\stick{\lqq provinces in \i{France?} Whence is it that}
\stick{\lqq the few remaining \i{Chateaus} amongst}
\stick{\lqq them are so dismantled,\tsk so unfurnish-}
\stick{\lqq ed, and in so ruinous and desolate a}
\stick{\lqq condition?\tsk Because, Sir, (he would}
\stick{say) \lqq in that kingdom no man has any}
\stick{\lqq country-interest to support;\tsk the little}
\stick{\lqq interest of any kind, which any man}
\stick{\lqq has any where in it, is concentrated in}
\stick{\lqq the court, and the looks of the Grand}
\stick{\lqq Monarch; by the sun-shine of whose}
\stick{\lqq countenance, or the clouds which pass}
\stick{\lqq a-cross it, every \i{French} man lives or}
\lqq dies.\,”

\tight{Another political reason which prompt-}\break
\stick{ed my father so strongly to guard against}
\catch{the}
\stick{the least evil accident in my mother’s} 
\stick{lying-in in the country,\tsh was, That}
\stick{any such instance would infallibly throw}
\stick{a balance of power, too great already,}
\stick{into the weaker vessels of the gentry, in}
\stick{his own, or higher stations;\tsh which,}
\stick{with the many other usurped rights}
\stick{which that part of the constitution was}
\stick{hourly establishing,\tsk would, in the end,} 
\stick{prove fatal to the monarchical system of} 
\stick{domestick government established in the}
first creation of things by God.

In this point he was entirely of Sir\break
\stick{\i{Robert Filmer}’s opinion, That the plans} 
\stick{and institutions of the greatest mo-}
\stick{narchies in the eastern parts of the world,} 
\stick{were, originally, all stolen from that ad-}
\stick{mirable pattern and prototype of this}
\stick{houshold and paternal power;\tsk which,}
\stick{for a century, he said, and more, had}
\catch{gra-}
\stick{gradually been degenerating away into}
\stick{a mix’d government;\tsk the form of} 
\stick{which, however desirable in great com-}
\stick{binations of the species,\tsk was very}
\stick{troublesome in small ones,\tsk and seldom}
\stick{produced any thing, that he saw, but} 
sorrow and confusion.

For all these reasons, private and pub-\break
\stick{lick, put together,\tsk my father was for}
\stick{having the man-midwife by all means,\tsk} 
\stick{my mother by no means. My father}
\stick{begg’d and intreated, she would for once}
\stick{recede from her prerogative in this mat-}
\stick{ter, and suffer him to choose for her;\tsk} 
\stick{my mother, on the contrary, insisted up-}
\stick{on her privilege in this matter, to choose} 
\stick{for herself,\tsk and have no mortal’s help} 
\stick{but the old woman’s.\tsk What could my}
\stick{father do? He was almost at his wit’s}
\stick{end;\tsh talked it over with her in all} 
\catch{moods;}
\stick{moods;\tsk placed his arguments in all} 
\stick{lights;\tsk argued the matter with her} 
\stick{like a christian,\tsk like a heathen,\tsk like} 
\stick{a husband,\tsk like a father,\tsk like a pa-}
\stick{triot,\tsk like a man:\tsk My mother an-}
\stick{swered every thing only like a woman;} 
\stick{which was a little hard upon her;\tsk for}
\stick{as she could not assume and fight it out} 
\stick{behind such a variety of characters,\tsk}
\stick{’twas no fair match:\tsk ’twas seven to} 
\stick{one.\tsk What could my mother do?\tsh}
\stick{She had the advantage (otherwise she}
\stick{had been certainly overpowered) of a}
\stick{small reinforcement of chagrine personal}
\stick{at the bottom which bore her up, and} 
\stick{enabled her to dispute the affair with my}
\stick{father with so equal an advantage,\tsh}
\stick{that both sides sung \i{Te Deum}. In a}
\stick{word, my mother was to have the old}
\stick{woman,\tsk and the operator was to have}
\stick{licence to drink a bottle of wine with} 
\catch{my}
\stick{my father and my uncle \i{Toby Shandy} in}
\stick{the back parlour,\tsk for which he was to} 
be paid five guineas.

I must beg leave, before I finish this\break
\stick{chapter, to enter a caveat in the breast} 
\stick{of my fair reader;\tsk and it is this:\tsh}
\stick{Not to take it absolutely for granted}
\stick{from an unguarded word or two which} 
\stick{I have dropp’d in it,\tsh\lqq That I am a}
\stick{married man.”\tsk I own the tender appel-}
\stick{lation of my dear, dear \i{Jenny},\tsk with}
\stick{some other strokes of conjugal know-}
\stick{ledge, interspersed here and there, might,}
\stick{naturally enough, have misled the most} 
\stick{candid judge in the world into such a} 
\stick{determination against me.\tsk All I plead}
\stick{for, in this case, Madam, is strict justice,}
\stick{and that you do so much of it, to me as} 
\stick{well as to yourself,\tsk as not to prejudge,}
\stick{or receive such an impression of me, till}
\catch{you}
\stick{you have better evidence, than I am}
\stick{positive, at present, can be produced}
\stick{against me:\tsk Not that I can be so vain}
\stick{or unreasonable, Madam, as to desire}
\stick{you should therefore think, that my dear,}
\stick{dear \i{Jenny} is my kept mistress;\tsk no,\tsk}
\stick{that would be flattering my character in}
\stick{the other extream, and giving it an air}
\stick{of freedom, which, perhaps, it has no}
\stick{kind of right to. All I contend for, is} 
\stick{the utter impossibility for some volumes,} 
\stick{that you, or the most penetrating spirit} 
\stick{upon earth, should know how this mat-}
\stick{ter really stands.\tsk It is not impossible,}
\stick{but that my dear, dear \i{Jenny!} tender as}

\stick{Consider,\tsk I was born in the year eigh-}
\stick{teen.\tsk Nor is there any thing unnatural}
\stick{or extravagant in the supposition, that}
\stick{my dear \i{Jenny} may be my friend.\tsk}
\stick{Friend!\tsk My friend.\tsk Surely, Madam,}
\catch{a}
\stick{a friendship between the two sexes may}
\stick{subsist, and be supported without\tsfill}
\stick{Fy! Mr.\@ \i{Shandy:}\tsk Without any thing,}

His opinion, in this matter, was, That\break

\catch{lecture} 
\stick{lecture upon \i{Crackenthorp} or \i{Burgersdi}-}

\stick{the difference of an argument \i{ad igno}-}

\stick{consisted; so that I well remember, when}
\stick{he went up along with me to enter my}

\stick{a matter of just wonder with my worthy} 
\stick{tutor, and two or three fellows of that} 
\stick{learned society,\tsk that a man who knew}
\stick{not so much as the names of his tools,}
\stick{should be able to work after that fashion}
with ’em.

To work with them in the best man-\break

\patch[14pt]{Whether}

Whether this was the case of the sin-\break
\stick{gularity of my father’s notions\tsk or that}
\stick{his judgment, at length, became the} 
\stick{dupe of his wit;\tsk or how far, in many} 
\stick{of his notions, he might, tho’ odd, be}
\stick{absolutely right;\tsk the reader, as he}
\stick{comes at them, shall decide. All that}
\stick{I maintain here, is, that in this one, of}
\stick{the influence of Christian names, how-}
\stick{ever it gain’d footing, he was serious;\tsk} 
\stick{he was all uniformity;\tsk he was systema-}
\stick{tical, and, like all systematick reasoners,} 
\stick{he would move both heaven and earth,} 
\stick{and twist and torture every thing in na-}
\stick{ture to support his hypothesis. In a}
\stick{word, I repeat it over again;\tsk he was}
\stick{serious;\tsk and, in consequence of it, he} 
\stick{would lose all kind of patience whenever}
\stick{he saw people, especially of condition,}
\stick{who should have known better,\tsh as}
\stck{careless and as indifferent about the name}
\catch{they} 
\stick{they imposed upon their child,\tsk or more}
\stick{so, than in the choice of \i{Ponto} or \i{Cupid}} 
for their puppy dog.

This, he would say, look’d ill;\tsk and\break
\stick{had, moreover, this particular aggrava-}
\stick{tion in it, \i{viz}. That when once a vile}
\stick{name was wrongfully or injudiciously} 
\stick{given, ’twas not like the case of a man’s} 
\stick{character, which, when wrong’d, might}
\stick{hereafter be clear’d;\tsh and, possibly,} 
\stick{sometime or other, if not in the man’s life,} 
\stick{at least after his death,\tsk be, somehow} 
\stick{or other, set to rights with the world:}
\stick{But the injury of this, he would say,} 
\stick{could never be undone;\tsk nay, he doubt-}
\stick{ed even whether an act of parliament} 
\stick{could reach it:\tsh He knew as well as}
\stick{you, that the legislature assum’d a power}
\stick{over surnames;\tsk but for very strong} 
\stick{reasons, which he could give, it had ne-}
\catch{ver} 
\stick{ver yet adventured, he would say, to go}
a step further.

\noindent
\stick{\hfill It was observable, that tho’ my father,} 
\stick{in consequence of this opinion, had, as I} 
\stick{have told you, the strongest likings and}
\stick{dislikings towards certain names;\tsk that}
\stick{there were still numbers of names which} 
\stick{hung so equally in the balance before}
\stck{him, that they were absolutely indifferent}
\stick{to him. \i{Jack}, \i{Dick}, and \i{Tom} were of}
\stick{this class: These my father call’d neutral}
\stick{names;\tsk affirming of them, without a}
\stick{satyr, That there had been as many}
\stick{knaves and fools, at least, as wise and}
\stick{good men, since the world began, who}
\stick{had indifferently borne them;\tsk so that,}
\stck{like equal forces acting against each other}
\stick{in contrary directions, he thought they}
\stick{mutually destroyed each others effects;}
\stick{for which reason, he would often declare,}
\catch{He,\sic}
\stick{He would not give a cherry-stone to}
\stick{choose amongst them. \i{Bob}, which was}
\stick{my brother’s name, was another of these} 
\stick{neutral kinds of Christian names, which} 
\stick{operated very little either way; and as}
\stick{my father happen’d to be at \i{Epsom}, when} 
\stick{it was given him,\tsk he would oft times} 
\stick{thank heaven it was no worse. \i{Andrew}}
\stick{was something like a negative quantity} 
\stick{in Algebra with him;\tsk ’twas worse, he}
\stick{said, than nothing.\tsk \i{William} stood pret-}
\stick{ty high:\tsh \i{Numps} again was low with}
\stick{him:\tsk and \i{Nick}, he said, was the \s{Devil}.}

But, of all the names in the universe,\break 
\stick{he had the most unconquerable aversion} 
\stick{for \s{Tristram};\tsk he had the lowest and}
\stick{most contemptible opinion of it of any} 
\stick{thing in the world,\tsk thinking it could}
\stck{possibly produce nothing in \i{rerum naturâ},}
\stick{but what was extreamly mean and piti-}
\catch{ful:}

\stick{on the subject, in which, by the bye, he} 
\stick{was frequently involved,\tsh he would}
\stick{sometimes break off in a sudden and spi-}
\stick{rited \s{Epiphonema}, or rather \s{Erotesis},} 
\stick{raised a third, and sometimes a full fifth,} 
\stick{above the key of the discourse,\tsh and} 
\stick{demand it categorically of his antagonist,}

\tsh I wonder what’s all that noise,\break 
\stick{and running backwards and forwards}
\stick{for, above stairs, quoth my father, ad-}
\stick{dressing himself, after an hour and a}
\stick{half’s silence, to my uncle \toby,\tsh who}
\catch{you}
\stick{you must know, was sitting on the op-}
\stick{posite side of the fire, smoking his social}
\stick{pipe all the time, in mute contemplation} 
\stick{of a new pair of black-plush-breeches}
\stick{which he had got on:\tsk What can they} 
\stick{be doing brother? quoth my father,\tsk}
we can scarce hear ourselves talk.

I think, replied my uncle \toby, taking\break
\stick{his pipe from his mouth, and striking}
\stick{the head of it two or three times upon}
\stick{the nail of his left thumb, as he began} 
\stick{his sentence,\tsh I think, says he:\tsh}
\stick{But to enter rightly into my uncle \toby's} 
\stick{sentiments upon this matter, you must} 
\stick{be made to enter first a little into his}
\stick{character, the out-lines of which I shall}
\stick{just give you, and then the dialogue be-}
\stick{tween him and my father will go on as}
well again.
\patch[14pt]{\tsk Pray}

\tsk Pray what was that man’s name,\tsk\break 
\stick{for I write in such a hurry, I have no} 
\stick{time to recollect or look for it,\tsh who}
\stick{first made the observation, \lqq That there}
\stick{was great inconstancy in our air and cli-}
\stick{mate?” Whoever he was, ’twas a just}
\stick{and good observation in him.\tsk But the}
\stick{corollary drawn from it, namely, \lqq That}
\stick{it is this which has furnished us with} 
\stick{such a variety of odd and whimsical cha-}
\stick{racters;”\tsk that was not his;\tsk it was}
\stick{found out by another man, at least a}
\stick{century and a half after him:\tsk Then}
\stick{again,\tsk that this copious store-house of} 
\stick{original materials, is the true and natural}
\stick{cause that our Comedies are so much bet-}
\stck{ter than those of \i{France}, or any others that}
\stick{either have, or can be wrote upon the}
\stick{Continent;\tsh that discovery was not}
\stick{fully made till about the middle of king}
\i{William}’s reign,\tsk when the great \i{Dryden},
\catch{in}
\stick{in writing one of his long prefaces, (if I}
\stick{mistake not) most fortunately hit upon}
\stick{it. Indeed toward the latter end of}
\stick{queen \i{Anne}, the great \i{Addison} began to}
\stick{patronize the notion, and more fully ex-}
\stick{plained it to the world in one or two of} 
\stick{his Spectators;\tsk but the discovery was} 
\stick{not his.\tsk Then, fourthly and lastly, that}
\stick{this strange irregularity in our climate,}
\stick{producing so strange an irregularity in} 
\stick{our characters,\tsk doth thereby, in} 
\stick{some sort, make us amends, by giving} 
\stck{us somewhat to make us merry with when} 
\stick{the weather will not suffer us to go out}
\stick{of doors,\tsk that observation is my own;\tsk}
\stick{and was struck out by me this very rainy} 
\stick{day, \i{March} 26, 1759, and betwixt the}
hours of nine and ten in the morning.

Thus,\tsk thus my fellow labourers and\break
\stick{associates in this great harvest of our}
\catch{learning,}
\stick{learning, now ripening before our eyes;} 
\stick{thus it is, by slow steps of casual increase,}
\stick{that our knowledge physical, metaphy-}
\stick{sical, physiological, polemical, nautical,} 
\stick{mathematical, ænigmatical, technical,}
\stick{biographical, romantical, chemical, and} 
\stick{obstetrical, with fifty other branches of it,}
\stick{(most of ’em ending, as these do, in \i{ical)}\sic}
\stick{have, for these two last centuries and} 
\stick{more, gradually been creeping upwards} 
\stick{towards that Ακμὴ of their perfections,}
\stick{from which, if we may form a conjecture} 
\stick{from the advances of these last seven} 
years, we cannot possibly be far off.

When that happens, it is to be hoped,\break
\stick{it will put an end to all kind of writings}
\stick{whatsoever;\tsk the want of all kind of} 
\stick{writing will put an end to all kind of}
\stick{reading;\tsk and that in time, \i{As war be}-}
\stick{\i{gets poverty; poverty peace},\tsh must, in}
\catch{course,}
\stick{course, put an end to all kind of know-}
\stick{ledge,\tsk and then\tsh we shall have all} 
\stick{to begin over again; or, in other words,}
be exactly where we started.

\tsh Happy! thrice happy Times!\break
\stick{I~only wish that the æra of my begetting,} 
\stick{as well as the mode and manner of it,}
\stick{had been a little alter’d,\tsk or that it could} 
\stick{have been put off with any convenience} 
\stick{to my father or mother, for some twenty} 
\stick{or five-and-twenty years longer, when~a}
\stick{man in the literary world might have}
stood some chance.\tsh 

But I forget my uncle \toby, whom all\break
\stick{this while we have left knocking the}
ashes out of his tobacco-pipe.

His humour was of that particular\break
\stick{species, which does honour to our atmo-}
\catch{sphere;}
\stick{sphere; and I should have made no scru-}
\stick{ple of ranking him amongst one of the} 
\stick{first-rate productions of it, had not there}
\stick{appear’d too many strong lines in it of~a} 
\stick{family-likeness, which shewed that he}
\stick{derived the singularity of his temper}
\stick{more from blood, than either wind or} 
\stick{water, or any modifications or combina-}
\stick{tions of them whatever: And I have,} 
\stick{therefore, oft times wondered, that my} 
\stick{father, tho’ I believe he had his reasons}
\stick{for it, upon his observing some tokens}
\stick{of excentricity in my course when I was}
\stick{a boy,\tsk should never once endeavour to}
\stick{account for them in this way; for all the}
\stick{\s{Shandy Family} were of an original}
\stick{character throughout;\tsh I mean the}
\stick{males,\tsk the females had no character at}
\stick{all,\tsk except, indeed, my great aunt \s{Di}-}
\stick{\s{nah}, who, about sixty years ago, was} 
\stick{married and got with child by the coach-}
\catch{man,} 
\stick{man, for which my father, according to}
\stick{his hypothesis of Christian names, would} 
\stick{often say, She might thank her godfa-}
thers and godmothers.

It will seem very strange,\tsh and I\break 
\stick{would as soon think of dropping a riddle}
\stick{in the reader’s way, which is not my in-}
\stick{terest to do, as set him upon guessing}
\stick{how it could come to pass, that an event}
\stick{of this kind, so many years after it had} 
\stick{happened, should be reserved for the in-}
\stick{terruption of the peace and unity, which} 
\stck{otherwise so cordially subsisted, between}
\stick{my father and my uncle \toby. One}
\stick{would have thought, that the whole}
\stick{force of the misfortune should have}
\stick{spent and wasted itself in the family at}
\stick{first,\tsk as is generally the case:\tsk But no-}
\stick{thing ever wrought with our family af-}
\stick{ter the ordinary way. Possibly at the}
\catch{very}
\stick{very time this happened, it might have} 
\stick{something else to afflict it; and as afflic-}
\stick{tions are sent down for our good, and} 
\stick{that as this had never done the \s{Shandy}}
\stick{\s{Family} any good at all, it might lye}
\stick{waiting till apt times and circumstances} 
\stck{should give it an opportunity to discharge}
\stick{its office.\tsh Observe, I determine}
\stick{nothing upon this.\tsh My way is}
\stick{ever to point out to the curious, differ-}
\stick{ent tracts of investigation, to come at}
\stick{the first springs of the events I tell;\tsk}
\stick{not with a pedantic \i{Fescue},\tsk or in the}
\stick{decisive Manner of \i{Tacitus}, who outwits} 
\stick{himself and his reader;\tsk but with the}
\stick{officious humility of a heart devoted to} 
\stck{the assistance merely of the inquisitive;\tsk}
\stick{to them I write,\tsh and by them I shall} 
\stick{be read,\tsh if any such reading as this} 
\stick{could be supposed to hold out so long,}
to the very end of the world.\patch{Why}

Why this cause of sorrow, therefore,\break
\stick{was thus reserved for my father and un-}
\stick{cle, is undetermined by me. But how}
\stick{and in what direction it exerted itself, so}
\stick{as to become the cause of dissatisfaction}
\stick{between them, after it began to operate,}
\stick{is what I am able to explain with great}
exactness, and is as follows:

My uncle \s{Toby Shandy}, Madam,\break 
\stick{was a gentleman, who, with the virtues} 
\stick{which usually constitute the character of}
\stick{a man of honour and rectitude,\tsk posses-}
\stick{sed one in a very eminent degree, which} 
\stick{is seldom or never put into the catalogue;}
\stick{and that was a most extream and unpa-}
\stick{rallel’d modesty of nature;\tsh tho’ I}
\stick{correct the word nature, for this reason,} 
\stick{that I may not prejudge a point which} 
\stick{must shortly come to a hearing; and that} 
\stick{is, Whether this modesty of his was na-}
\catch{tural}
\stick{tural or acquir’d.\tsh Which ever}
\stick{way my uncle \toby came by it, ’twas} 
\stick{nevertheless modesty in the truest sense} 
\stick{of it; and that is, Madam, not in regard}
\stick{to words, for he was so unhappy as to} 
\stick{have very little choice in them,\tsk but to}
\stick{things;\tsh and this kind of modesty so}
\stick{possess’d him, and it arose to such a} 
\stick{height in him, as almost to equal, if}
\stick{such a thing could be, even the modesty} 
\stick{of a woman: That female nicety, Ma-}
\stick{dam, and inward cleanliness of mind and} 
\stick{fancy, in your sex, which makes you so} 
much the awe of ours.

You will imagine, Madam, that my
\stick{uncle \toby had contracted all this from} 
\stick{this very source;\tsk that he had spent a} 
\stick{great part of his time in converse with} 
\stick{your sex; and that, from a thorough}
\stick{knowledge of you, and the force of imita-}
\catch{tion}
\stick{tion which such fair examples render ir-}
\stick{resistable,\tsk he had acquired this amiable}
turn of mind.

I wish I could say so,\tsk for unless it\break
\stick{was with his sister-in-law, my father’s}
\stick{wife and my mother,\tsh my uncle \toby}
\stick{scarce exchanged three words with the}
\stick{sex in as many years;\tsh no, he got it,} 
\stick{Madam, by a blow.\tsh A blow!\tsk Yes,}
\stick{Madam, it was owing to a blow from a} 
\stick{stone, broke off by a ball from the para-}
\stick{pet of a horn-work at the siege of \i{Namur},}
\stick{which struck full upon my uncle \toby's} 
\stick{groin.\tsk Which way could that effect it?} 
\stick{The story of that, Madam, is long and} 
\stick{interesting;\tsk but it would be running}
\stick{my history all upon heaps to give it you}
\stick{here.\tsh ’Tis for an episode hereafter;}
\stick{and every circumstance relating to it in} 
\stick{its proper place, shall be faithfully laid}
\catch{before}
\stick{before you:\tsk ’Till then, it is not in my}
\stick{power to give further light into this}
\stick{matter, or say more than what I have} 
\stick{said already,\tsk That my uncle \toby was}
\stick{a gentleman of unparallel’d modesty,}
\stick{which happening to be somewhat sub-}
\stick{tilized and rarified by the constant heat} 
\stick{of a little family-pride,\tsh they both so}
\stick{wrought together within him, that he}
\stick{could never bear to hear the affair of my}
\stick{aunt \s{Dinah} touch’d upon, but with the}
\stick{greatest emotion.\tsh The least hint of it} 
\stick{was enough to make the blood fly into}
\stick{his face;\tsk but when my father enlarged}
\stick{upon the story in mixed companies,} 
\stick{which the illustration of his hypothesis}
\stick{frequently obliged him to do,\tsk the un-}
\stick{fortunate blight of one of the fairest}
\stick{branches of the family, would set my} 
\stck{uncle \toby's honour and modesty o’bleed-}
\stick{ing; and he would often take my fa-}
\catch{ther}
\stick{ther aside, in the greatest concern ima-}
\stick{ginable, to expostulate and tell him, he}
\stick{would give him any thing in the world,}
only to let the story rest.

My father, I believe, had the truest\break
\stick{love and tenderness for my uncle \toby,}
\stick{that ever one brother bore towards ano-}
\stick{ther, and would have done any thing in}
\stck{nature, which one brother in reason could}
\stick{have desir’d of another, to have made my}
\stick{uncle \toby's heart easy in this, or any o-}
\stick{ther point. But this lay out of his power.}

\tsk My father, as I told you was a\break 
\stick{philosopher in grain,\tsk speculative,\tsk}
\stick{systematical;\tsk and my aunt \i{Dinah}’s af-}
\stick{fair was a matter of as much consequence}
\stick{to him, as the retrogradation of the pla-}
\stick{nets to \i{Copernicus:}\tsk The backslidings of}
\stick{\i{Venus} in her orbit fortified the \i{Copernican}}
\catch{system}
\stick{system, call’d so after his name; and the}
\stick{backslidings of my aunt \i{Dinah} in her or-}
\stick{bit, did the same service in establishing} 
\stick{my father’s system, which, I trust, will} 
\stick{for ever hereafter be call’d the \i{Shandean}}
\i{System}, after his.

In any other family dishonour, my fa-\break
\stick{ther, I believe, had as nice a sense of}
\stick{shame as any man whatever;\tsh and} 
\stick{neither he, nor, I dare say, \i{Copernicus},}
\stick{would have divulged the affair in either} 
\stick{case, or have taken the least notice of it}
\stick{to the world, but for the obligations}
\stick{they owed, as they thought, to truth.\tsk}
\stick{\i{Amicus Plato}, my father would say, con-}
\stick{struing the words to my uncle \toby, as}
\stick{he went along, \i{Amicus Plato}; that is,}
\stick{\s{Dinah} was my aunt;\tsk \i{sed magis amica}}
\i{veritas}\tsk but \s{Truth} is my sister.
\patch[14pt]{This}

This contrariety of humours betwixt\break
\stick{my father and my uncle, was the source}
\stick{of many a fraternal squabble. The one} 
\stick{could not bear to hear the tale of family}
\stick{disgrace recorded,\tsh and the other} 
\stick{would scarce ever let a day pass to an}
end without some hint at it.

For God’s sake, my uncle \toby would\break
\stick{cry,\tsh and for my sake, and for all our}
\stick{sakes, my dear brother \i{Shandy},\tsk do let}
\stick{this story of our aunt’s and her ashes}
\stick{sleep in peace;\tsk how can you,\tsk\!\tsk}
\stick{how can you have so little feeling and} 
\stick{compassion for the character of our fa-}
\stick{mily:\tsh What is the character of a fa-}
\stick{mily to an hypothesis? my father would}
\stick{reply.\tsh Nay, if you come to that\tsk}
\stick{what is the life of a family:\tsh The} 
\stick{life of a family!\tsk my uncle \toby would}
\stick{say, throwing himself back in his arm-}
\catch{chair,}
\stick{chair, and lifting up his hands, his eyes,} 
\stick{and one leg.\tsh Yes, the life,\tsh my}
\stick{father would say, maintaining his point.} 
\stick{How many thousands of ’em are there}
\stick{every year that comes cast away, (in all}
\stick{civilized countries at least)\tsh and con-}
\stick{sider’d as nothing but common air, in}
\stick{competition of an hypothesis. In my} 
\stick{plain sense of things, my uncle \toby,}
\stick{would answer,\tsk every such instance}
\stick{is downright \s{Murder}, let who will}
\stick{commit it.\tsh There lies your mistake,} 
\stick{my father would reply;\tsh for, in \i{Foro}}
\stick{\i{Scientiæ} there is no such thing as \s{Mur}-}
\s{der},\tsh ’tis only \s{Death}, brother.

My uncle \toby would never offer to\break 
\stick{answer this by any other kind of argu-}
\stick{ment, than that of whistling half a dozen}
\stick{bars of \i{Lillabullero}.\tsh You must know}
\catch{it}
\stick{it was the usual channel thro’ which his}
\stick{passions got vent, when any thing shock-}
\stick{ed or surprised him;\tsh but especially}
\stick{when any thing, which he deem’d very}
absurd, was offered.

As not one of our logical writers, nor\break
\stick{any of the commentators upon them,} 
\stick{that I remember, have thought proper to}
\stick{give a name to this particular species of} 
\stick{argument,\tsk I here take the liberty to do}
\stick{it myself, for two reasons. First, That,}
\stick{in order to prevent all confusion in dis-}
\stick{putes, it may stand as much distinguish-}
\stick{ed for ever, from every other species of}
\stick{argument,\tsh as the \i{Argumentum ad}}
\stck{\i{Verecundiam}, \i{ex Absurdo}, \i{ex Fortiori}, or any}
\stick{other argument whatsoever:\tsh And,}
\stick{secondly, That it may be said by my chil-}
\stick{dren’s children, when my head is laid to}
\stick{rest,\tsh that their learned grand father’s}
\catch{head}
\stick{head had been busied to as much pur-}
\stick{pose once, as other people’s:\tsk That he} 
\stick{had invented a name,\tsk and generously}
\stick{thrown it into the \s{Treasury} of the} 
\stick{\i{Ars Logica}, for one of the most unan-}
\stick{swerable arguments in the whole science.} 
\stick{And if the end of disputation is more to} 
\stick{silence than convince,\tsk they may add, if} 
\stick{they please, to one of the best arguments}
too.

I do therefore, by these presents,\break 
\stick{strictly order and command, That it be} 
\stick{known and distinguished by the name}
\stck{and title of the \i{Argumentum Fistulatorium},} 
\stick{and no other;\tsk and that it rank here-}
\stck{after with the \i{Argumentum Baculinum} and}
\stick{the \i{Argumentum ad Crumenam}, and for}

chapter.

\stick{the man only against the woman:\tsk As}
\stick{these two are enough in conscience for}

\dropcap{T}{he} learned Bishop \i{Hall}, I mean\break 
the famous Dr.\@ \i{Joseph Hall}, who\break
\stick{was Bishop of \i{Exeter} in King \i{James} the} 
\stick{First’s reign, tells us in one of his \i{Decads},}
\stick{at the end of his divine art of meditation,}
\stick{imprinted at \i{London}, in the year 1610,}
\stick{by \i{John Beal}, dwelling in \i{Aldersgate-street},}
\catch{\lqq That}
\stick{\lqq That it is an abominable thing for a}
\stick{man to commend himself;”\tsh and I real-}
ly think it is so.

And yet, on the other hand, when a\break
\stick{thing is executed in a masterly kind of a} 
\stick{fashion, which thing is not likely to be} 
\stick{found out;\tsk I think it is full as abomi-}
\stick{nable, that a man should lose the ho-}
\stick{nour of it, and go out of the world with} 
the conceit of it rotting in his head.

This is precisely my situation.

For in this long digression which I was\break 
\stick{accidentally led into, as in all my digres-}
\stick{sions (one only excepted) there is a} 
\stick{master-stroke of digressive skill, the me-}
\stick{rit of which has all along, I fear, been} 
\stick{overlooked by my reader,\tsk not for want}
\stick{of penetration in him,\tsk but because ’tis}
\catch{an}
\stick{an excellence seldom looked for, or ex-}
\stick{pected indeed, in a digression;\tsk and it} 
\stick{is this: That tho’ my digressions are all}
\stick{fair, as you observe,\tsk and that I fly off}
\stick{from what I am about, as far and as of-}
\stick{ten too as any writer in \i{Great-Britain};}
\stick{yet I constantly take care to order affairs}
\stick{so, that my main business does not stand} 
still in my absence.

I was just going, for example, to have 
\stick{given you the great out-lines of my uncle}
\stick{\toby's most whimsical character;\tsk when}
\stick{my aunt \i{Dinah} and the coachman came}
\stick{a-cross us, and led us a vagary some mil-}
\stick{lions of miles into the very heart of the}
\stick{planetary system: Notwithstanding all} 
\stick{this you perceive that the drawing of} 
\stick{my uncle \toby's character went on gently} 
\stick{all the time;\tsk not the great contours of}
\stick{it,\tsk that was impossible,\tsk but some fa-}
\catch{miliar}
\stick{miliar strokes and faint designations of} 
\stick{it, were here and there touch’d in, as we} 
\stick{went along, so that you are much better} 
\stick{acquainted with my uncle \toby now than} 
you was before.

By this contrivance the machinery of
\stick{my work is of a species by itself; two} 
\stick{contrary motions are introduced into it,} 
\stick{and reconciled, which were thought to} 
\stick{be at variance with each other. In a} 
\stick{word, my work is digressive, and it is} 
progressive too,\tsk and at the same time.

This, Sir, is a very different story\break
\stick{from that of the earth’s moving round}
\stick{her axis, in her diurnal rotation, with her}
\stick{progress in her elliptick orbit which}
\stick{brings about the year, and constitutes} 
\stick{that variety and vicissitude of seasons we} 
\stick{enjoy;\tsk though I own it suggested the}
\catch{thought,}
\stick{thought,\tsk as I believe the greatest of}
\stick{our boasted improvements and discove-}
\stick{ries have come from some such trifling}
hints.

\tight{Digressions, incontestably, are the sun-}
\stick{shine;\tsh they are the life, the soul of} 
\stick{reading;\tsk take them out of this book} 
\stick{for instance,\tsk you might as well take the}
\stick{book along with them;\tsk one cold eternal} 
\stick{winter would reign in every page of it;} 
\stick{restore them to the writer;\tsk he steps} 
\stick{forth like a bridegroom,\tsk bids All hail;} 
\stick{brings in variety, and forbids the appe-}
tite to fail.

All the dexterity is in the good cook-
\stick{ery and management of them, so as to}
\stick{be not only for the advantage of the}
\stick{reader, but also of the author, whose di-}
\stick{stress, in this matter, is truely pitiable:}
\catch{For}
\stick{For, if he begins a digression,\tsk from} 
\stick{that moment, I observe, his whole work}
\stick{stands stock still;\tsk and if he goes on}
\stick{with his main work,\tsh then there is an}
end of his digression.

\tsh This is vile work.\tsk For which
\stick{reason, from the beginning of this, you}
\stick{see, I have constructed the main work}
\stick{and the adventitious parts of it with such} 
\stick{intersections, and have so complicated} 
\stick{and involved the digressive and progres-}
\stick{sive movements, one wheel within ano-}
\stick{ther, that the whole machine, in general,} 
\stick{has been kept a-going;\tsk and, what’s}
\stick{more, it shall be kept a-going these forty} 
\stick{years, if it pleases the fountain of health} 
\stick{to bless me so long with life and good}
spirits.

\initial[nindent=3pt]{I}{Have} 
a strong propensity in me to\break
\tight{begin this chapter very nonsensically,}\break
\stick{and I will not balk my fancy.\tsk Accord-}
ingly I set off thus.

If the fixure of \i{Momus}’s glass, in the\break
\stick{human breast, according to the proposed}

\stick{That the very wisest and the very gravest}

And, secondly, That had the said glass\break
\stick{been there set up, nothing more would}
\stick{have been wanting, in order to have ta-}

\stick{ken a man’s character, but to have ta-}
\stick{ken a chair and gone softly, as you would}
\stick{to a dioptrical bee-hive, and look’d in;\tsk}
\stick{view’d the soul stark naked;\tsk observ’d}
\stick{all her motions,\tsk her machinations;\tsk}
\stick{traced all her maggots from their first}
\stick{engendering to their crawling forth;\tsk}
\stick{watched her loose in her frisks, her gam-}

\stick{tice of her more solemn deportment, con-}
\stick{sequent upon such frisks, \et\i{c}.\tsh then}
\stick{taken your pen and ink and set down}
\stick{nothing but what you had seen, and}
\stick{could have sworn to:\tsk But this is an}
\stick{advantage not to be had by the bio-}
\stick{grapher in this planet,\tsk in the planet}
\stick{\i{Mercury} (belike) it may be so, if not}
\stick{better still for him;\tsh for there the in-}
\stick{tense heat of the country, which is pro-}
\stick{ved by computators, from its vicinity to}
\stick{the sun, to be more than equal to that}
\catch{of}
\stick{of red hot iron,\tsk must, I think, long ago}
\stick{have vitrified the bodies of the inhabi-}
\stick{tants, (as the efficient cause) to suit them}
\stick{for the climate (which is the final cause);}
\stick{so that, betwixt them both, all the tene-}
\stick{ments of their souls, from top to bot-}
\stick{tom, may be nothing else, for aught the} 
\stck{soundest philosophy can shew to the con-}
\stick{trary, but one fine transparent body of} 
\stick{clear glass (bating the umbilical knot);\tsk}
\stick{so, that till the inhabitants grow old and} 
\stick{tolerably wrinkled, whereby the rays of} 
\stick{light, in passing through them, become}
\stick{so monstrously refracted,\tsh or return}
\stick{reflected from their surfaces in such}
\stick{transverse lines to the eye, that a man} 
\stick{cannot be seen thro’;\tsk his soul might as} 
\stick{well, unless, for mere ceremony,\tsk or} 
\stick{the trifling advantage which the umbi-}
\stick{lical point gave her,\tsk might, upon all}
\catch{other}
\stick{other accounts, I say, as well play the}
fool out o’doors as in her own house.

But this, as I said above, is not the
\stick{case of the inhabitants of this earth;\tsk} 
\stick{our minds shine not through the body,}
\stick{but are wrapt up here in a dark covering} 
\stick{of uncrystalized flesh and blood; so that}
\stick{if we would come to the specifick cha-}
\stick{racters of them, we must go some other}
way to work.

Many, in good truth, are the ways, 
\stick{which human wit has been forced to take} 
to do this thing with exactness.

Some, for instance, draw all their cha-
\stick{racters with wind instruments.\tsk \i{Virgil}} 
\stick{takes notice of that way in the affair of} 
\stick{\i{Dido} and \i{Æneas};\tsk but it is as fallacious}
\stick{as the breath of fame;\tsk and, moreover,}
\catch{be-}
\stick{bespeaks a narrow genius. I am not ig-}
\stick{norant that the \i{Italians} pretend to a ma-}
\stck{thematical exactness in their designations}
\stick{of one particular sort of character among}
\stick{them, from the \i{forte} or \i{piano} of a cer-}
\stick{tain wind instrument they use,\tsk which}
\stick{they say is infallible.\tsk I dare not men-}
\stick{tion the name of the instrument in this}
\stick{place;\tsk ’tis sufficient we have it amongst}
\stick{us,\tsk but never think of making a draw-}
\stick{ing by it;\tsk this is ænigmatical, and in-}
\stick{tended to be so, at least, \i{ad populum:}\tsk}
\stick{And therefore I beg, Madam, when you}
\stick{come here, that you read on as fast as}
\stick{you can, and never stop to make any in-}
quiry about it.

There are others again, who will draw\break
\stick{a man’s character from no other helps in}
\stick{the world, but merely from his evacua-}
\stick{tions;\tsk but this often gives a very in-}
\catch{correct}
\stick{correct out-line,\tsk unless, indeed, you}
\stick{take a sketch of his repletions too; and}
\stick{by correcting one drawing from the}
\stick{other, compound one good figure out of}
them both.

I should have no objection to this me-\break
\stick{thod, but that I think it must smell too} 
\stick{strong of the lamp,\tsk and be render’d still}
\stick{more operose, by forcing you to have an} 
\stick{eye to the rest of his \i{Non-Naturals}.\tsk}
\stick{Why the most natural actions of a man’s} 
\stick{life should be call’d his Non-Naturals,\tsk}
is another question.

There are others, fourthly, who dis-\break
\stick{dain every one of these expedients;\tsk not}
\stick{from any fertility of his\sic\ own, but from}
\stick{the various ways of doing it, which they} 
\stick{have borrowed from the honourable de-}
\catch{vices}
\stick{vices which the Pentagraphic Brethren \fnast}
\stick{of the brush have shewn in taking co-}
\stick{pies.\tsk  These, you must know, are your}
great historians.

One of these you will see drawing a\break
\stick{full length character \i{against the light};\tsk}
\stick{that’s illiberal,\tsk dishonest,\tsk and hard}
upon the character of the man who sits.

Others, to mend the matter, will make\break
\stick{a drawing of you in the \i{Camera};\tsk that}
\stick{is most unfair of all,\tsk because, \i{there} you}
\stick{are sure to be represented in some of}

\dropcap{I}{f} \tight{I was not morally sure that the

\stick{previously have convinced him, that}
\stick{there is no instrument so fit to draw such}
\stick{a thing with, as that which I have pitch’d}
upon.\patch[14pt]{A}

A man and his \s{Hobby-Horse},\break
\stick{tho’ I cannot say that they act and re-act} 
\stick{exactly after the same manner in which} 
\stick{the soul and body do upon each other:} 
\stick{Yet doubtless there is a communication} 
\stick{between them of some kind, and my}
\stick{opinion rather is, that there is something} 
\stick{in it more of the manner of electrified}
\stick{bodies,\tsk and that, by means of the heated} 
\stick{parts of the rider, which come immedi-}
\stick{ately into contact with the back of the} 
\stick{\s{Hobby-Horse}.\tsk By long journies and}
\stick{much friction, it so happens that the bo-}
\stick{dy of the rider is at length fill’d as full}
\stick{of \s{Hobby-Horsical} matter as it can}
\stick{hold;\tsk so that if you are able to give}
\stick{but a clear description of the nature of}
\stick{the one, you may form a pretty exact}
\stick{notion of the genius and character of the}
other.\patch[14pt]{Now}

Now the \s{Hobby-Horse} which my\break
\stick{uncle \toby always rode upon, was, in my}
\stick{opinion, an \s{Hobby-Horse} well worth} 
\stick{giving a description of, if it was only}
\stick{upon the score of his great singularity;}
\stick{for you might have travelled from \i{York}}
\stick{to \i{Dover},\tsk from \i{Dover} to \i{Penzance} in}
\stick{\i{Cornwall}, and from \i{Penzance} to \i{York} back}
\stick{again, and not have seen such another}
\stick{upon the road; or if you had seen such}
\stick{a one, whatever haste you had been in,} 
\stick{you must infallibly have stopp’d to have}
\stick{taken a view of him. Indeed, the gait}
\stick{and figure of him was so strange, and so} 
\stick{utterly unlike was he, from his head to} 
\stick{his tail, to any one of the whole species,} 
\stick{that it was now and then made a matter} 
\stick{of dispute,\tsh whether he was really a}
\stick{\s{Hobby-Horse} or no: But as the Philo-}
\stick{sopher would use no other argument to}
\stck{the sceptic, who disputed with him against}
\catch{the} 
\stick{the reality of motion, save that of rising}
\stick{up upon his legs, and walking a-cross}
\stick{the room;\tsk so would my uncle \toby use} 
\stick{no other argument to prove his \s{Hobby-}}
\stick{\s{Horse} was a \s{Hobby-Horse} indeed,} 
\stick{but by getting upon his back and riding}
\stick{him about;\tsk leaving the world after that} 
to determine the point as it thought fit.

In good truth, my uncle \toby mounted\break
\stick{him with so much pleasure, and he car-}
\stick{ried my uncle \toby so well,\tsh that he} 
\stick{troubled his head very little with what}
\stick{the world either said or thought about}
it.

It is now high time, however, that I\break
\stick{give you a description of him:\tsk But to}
\stick{go on regularly, I only beg you will give} 
\stick{me leave to acquaint you first, how my} 
uncle \toby came by him.

\stick{unspeakable miseries,\tsk owing to a suc-}
\stick{cession of exfoliations from the \i{oss pubis},}
\stick{and the outward edge of that part of the}
\stick{\i{coxendix} called the \i{oss illeum},\tsh both}
\stick{which bones were dismally crush’d, as}
\stick{much by the irregularity of the stone,}
\stick{which I told you was broke off the pa-}
\catch{rapet,}
\stick{rapet,\tsk as by its size,\tsk (though it was}
\stick{pretty large) which inclined the surgeon} 
\stick{all along to think, that the great injury} 
\stick{which it had done my uncle \toby's groin,}
\stick{was more owing to the gravity of the} 
\stick{stone itself, than to the projectile force} 
\stick{of it,\tsk which he would often tell him} 
was a great happiness.

My father at that time was just begin-\break
\stick{ning business in \i{London}, and had taken a} 
\stick{house;\tsk and as the truest friendship and} 
\stick{cordiality subsisted between the two bro-}
\stick{thers,\tsk and that my father thought my} 
\stick{uncle \toby could no where be so well} 
\stick{nursed and taken care of as in his own} 
\stick{house,\tsh he assign’d him the very best} 
\stick{apartment in it.\tsk And what was a much} 
\stick{more sincere mark of his affection still,} 
\stick{he would never suffer a friend or an ac-}
\stick{quaintance to step into the house on any}
\catch{occasion,}
\stick{occasion, but he would take him by the}
\stick{hand, and lead him up stairs to see his}
\stick{brother \toby, and chat an hour by his}
bed side.

The history of a soldier’s wound be-\break
\stick{guiles the pain of it;\tsk my uncle’s visit-}
\stick{ers at least thought so, and in their daily}
\stick{calls upon him, from the courtesy arising}
\stick{out of that belief, they would frequently}
\stick{turn the discourse to that subject,\tsk and}
\stick{from that subject the discourse would}
generally roll on to the siege itself.

These conversations were infinitely\break 
\stick{kind; and my uncle \toby received great} 
\stick{relief from them, and would have recei-}
\stick{ved much more, but that they brought} 
\stick{him into some unforeseen perplexities,}
\stick{which, for three months together, re-}
\stick{tarded his cure greatly; and if he had}
\catch{not}
\stick{not hit upon an expedient to extricate} 
\stick{himself out of them, I verily believe they}
would have laid him in his grave.

What these perplexities of my uncle\break
\stick{\toby were,\tsh ’tis impossible for you to}
\stick{guess;\tsk if you could,\tsk I should blush;} 
\stick{not as a relation,\tsk not as a man,\tsk nor}
\stick{even as a woman,\tsk but I should blush as} 
\stick{an author; inasmuch as I set no small} 
\stick{store by myself upon this very account,} 
\stick{that my reader has never yet been able}
\stick{to guess at any thing. And in this, Sir,} 
\stick{I am of so nice and singular a humour,}
\stick{that if I thought you was able to form}
\stick{the least judgment or probable conjecture}
\stick{to yourself, of what was to come in the} 
\stick{next page,\tsk I would tear it out of my}
book.
