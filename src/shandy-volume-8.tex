\initial{I}{Do} not speak it with regard to the\break
\tight{coarseness or cleanness of them\tsh or}\break
\stick{the strength of their gussets\tsh but pray}
\stick{do not night-shifts differ from day-shifts}
\stick{as much in this particular, as in any}
\stick{thing else in the world; That they so far}
\stick{exceed the others in length, that when}
\stick{you are laid down in them, they fall al-}
\stick{most as much below the feet, as the day-}
shifts fall short of them?

Widow Wadman’s night-shifts (as\break
\stick{was the mode I suppose in King Wil-}
\stick{liam’s and Queen Anne’s reigns) were}
\stick{cut however after this fashion; and if the}
\stick{fashion is changed, (for in Italy they are}
\stick{come to nothing)\tsh so much the worse}\catch{for}
\stick{for the public; they were two Flemish} 
\stick{ells and a half in length; so that allow-}
\stick{ing a moderate woman two ells, she had} 
\stick{half an ell to spare, to do what she would} 
with.

Now from one little indulgence gain’d\break
\stick{after another, in the many bleak and de-}
\stick{cemberly nights of a seven years widow-}
\stick{hood, things had insensibly come to this} 
\stick{pass, and for the two last years had got} 
\stick{establish’d into one of the ordinances of}
\stick{the bed-chamber\tsk That as soon as Mrs.}
\stick{Wadman was put to bed, and had got her}
\stick{legs stretched down to the bottom of it, of}
\stick{which she always gave Bridget notice\tsk} 
\stick{Bridget with all suitable decorum, having}
\stick{first open’d the bed-cloaths at the feet,} 
\stick{took hold of the half ell of cloath we}
\stick{are speaking of, and having gently, and}
\natch{with}
\stick{with both her hands, drawn it down-}
\stick{wards to its furthest extension, and then}
\stick{contracted it again side long by four or} 
\stick{five even plaits, she took a large corking} 
\stick{pin out of her sleeve, and with the}
\stick{point directed towards her, pin’d the} 
\stick{plaits all fast together a little above the} 
\stick{hem; which done, she tuck’d all in} 
\stick{tight at the feet, and wish’d her mistress}
a good night.

This was constant, and without any\break
\stick{other variation than this; that on shiv-}
\stck{ering and tempestuous nights, when Brid-}
\stick{get untuck’d the feet of the bed, \etc}
\stick{to do this\tsk she consulted no thermo-}
\stick{meter but that of her own passions;}
\stick{and so performed it standing\tsk kneeling}
\stick{\tsk or squatting, according to the different}
\stick{degrees of faith, hope, and charity, she}
\natch{was}
\stick{was in, and bore towards her mistress} 
\stick{that night. In every other respect, the} 
\stick{\textit{etiquette} was sacred, and might have}
\stick{vied with the most mechanical one of} 
\stick{the most inflexible bed-chamber in}
Christendom.

The first night, as soon as the cor-\break
\stick{poral had conducted my uncle Toby up}
\stick{stairs, which was about ten\tsh Mrs.}
\stick{Wadman threw herself into her arm} 
\stick{chair, and crossing her left knee with} 
\stick{her right, which formed a resting-place}
\stick{for her elbow, she reclin’d her cheek} 
\stick{upon the palm of her hand, and leaning} 
\stick{forwards, ruminated till midnight upon}
both sides of the question.

The second night she went to her bu-\break
\stick{reau, and having ordered Bridget to}
\natch{bring}
\stick{bring her up a couple of fresh candles}
\stick{and leave them upon the table, she took}
\stick{out her marriage-settlement, and read it} 
\stick{over with great devotion: and the third} 
\stick{night (which was the last of my uncle} 
\stick{Toby’s stay) when Bridget had pull’d} 
\stick{down the night-shift, and was assaying} 
to stick in the corking pin\tsh

\tsh With a kick of both heels at\break
\stick{once, but at the same time the most}
\stick{natural kick that could be kick’d in her}
\stick{situation\tsk for supposing\enspace\astW6}
\stick{\astW3\enspace to be the sun in its meridian, it}
\stick{was a north-east kick\tsh she kick’d the}
\stick{pin out of her fingers\tsh\!\tsk the \textit{etiquette}}
\stick{which hung upon it, down\tsh down it} 
\stick{fell to the ground, and was shivered into}
a thousand atoms.\patch{From}

For my part, could I always have the\break
\stick{ordering of it which way I would be} 
\stick{burnt myself\tsk for I cannot bear the}
\stick{thoughts of being burnt like a beast\tsk}
\stick{I would oblige a housewife constantly to}

\quad
\tsh And so to make sure of both sys-\break
\stick{tems, Mrs. Wadman predetermined to} 
\stick{light my uncle Toby neither at this end or}
\stick{that; but, like a prodigal’s candle, to} 
\stick{light him, if possible, at both ends at}
once.

Now, through all the lumber rooms\break
\stick{of military furniture, including both of}
\stick{horse and foot, from the great arsenal} 
\stick{of Venice to the Tower of London}
\stick{(exclusive) if Mrs.\@ Wadman had been} 
\stick{rummaging for seven years together,}
\stick{and with Bridget to help her, she could}
\stick{not have found any one \textit{blind} or \textit{man}-}
\stick{\textit{telet} so fit for her purpose, as that which}
\natch{the}
\stick{the expediency of my uncle Toby’s af-}
fairs had fix’d up ready to her hands.

I believe I have not told you\tsh but\break
\stick{I don’t know\tsh possibly I have\tsh be} 
\stick{it as it will, ’tis one of the number of} 
\stick{those many things, which a man had} 
\stick{better do over again, than dispute about}
\stick{it\tsk That whatever town or fortress the}
\stick{corporal was at work upon, during the}
\stick{course of their campaign, my uncle Toby}
\stick{always took care on the inside of his} 
\stick{sentry-box, which was towards his left}
\stick{hand, to have a plan of the place, fasten’d} 
\stick{up with two or three pins at the top, but} 
\stick{loose at the bottom, for the conveniency}
\stick{of holding it up to the eye, \etc .\@ .\@ .\@ as}
\stick{occasions required; so that when an} 
\stick{attack was resolved upon, Mrs.\@ Wadman}
\stick{had nothing more to do, when she had}
\natch{got} 
\stick{got advanced to the door of the sentry-}
\stick{box, but to extend her right hand; and} 
\stick{edging in her left foot at the same move-}
\stick{ment, to take hold of the map or plan,}
\stick{or upright, or whatever it was, and with}
\stick{outstretched neck meeting it half way,} 
\stick{\tsk  to advance it towards her; on which}
\stick{my uncle Toby’s passions were sure to} 
\stick{catch fire\tsh for he would instantly take}
\stick{hold of the other corner of the map in} 
\stick{his left hand, and with the end of his}
\stick{pipe, in the other, begin an expla-}
nation.

When the attack was advanced to this\break
\stick{point;\tsh the world will naturally enter} 
\stick{into the reasons of Mrs.\@ Wadman’s next} 
\stick{stroke of generalship\tsh which was, to} 
\stick{take my uncle Toby’s tobacco-pipe out} 
\stick{of his hand as soon as she possibly could;}
\natch{which,}
\stick{which, under one pretence or other, but}
\stick{generally that of pointing more distinctly}
\stick{at some redoubt or breast-work in the}
\stick{map, she would effect before my uncle}
\stick{Toby (poor soul!) had well march’d a-}
bove half a dozen toises with it.

\tsk  It obliged my uncle Toby to make\break
use of his forefinger.

The difference it made in the attack\break
\stick{was this; That in going upon it, as in}
\stick{the first case, with the end of her fore-}
\stick{finger against the end of my uncle Toby’s}
\stick{tobacco-pipe, she might have travelled}
\stick{with it, along the lines, from Dan to Beer-}
\stick{sheba, had my uncle Toby’s lines reach’d}
\stick{so far, without any effect: For as there}
\stick{was no arterial or vital heat in the end of}
\stick{the tobacco-pipe, it could excite no sen-}
\natch{timent} 
\stick{timent\tsh it could neither give fire by}
\stick{pulsation \tsh or receive it by sympathy}
\tsh ’twas nothing but smoak.

Whereas, in following my uncle\break
\stick{Toby’s forefinger with hers, close thro’}
\stick{all the little turns and indentings of his}
\stick{works\tsk pressing sometimes against} 
\stick{the side of it\tsk then treading upon it's\sic}
\stick{nail\tsk then tripping it up\tsk then} 
\stick{touching it here\tsk then there, and so}
\stick{on\tsk it set something at least in mo-}
tion.

This, tho’ slight skirmishing, and at\break
\stick{a distance from the main body, yet drew} 
\stick{on the rest; for here, the map usually} 
\stick{falling with the back of it, close to the} 
\stick{side of the sentry-box, my uncle Toby,} 
\stick{in the simplicity of his soul, would lay his}
\natch{hand}
\stick{hand flat upon it, in order to go on with}
\stick{his explanation; and Mrs.\@ Wadman, by a} 
\stick{manœuvre as quick as thought, would} 
\stck{as certainly place her’s close besides it; this}
\stick{at once opened a communication, large} 
\stick{enough for any sentiment to pass or re-}
\stick{pass, which a person skill’d in the ele-}
\stick{mentary and practical part of love-}
making, has occasion for\tsh

By bringing up her forefinger parallel\break 
\stick{(as before) to my uncle Toby’s\tsk it}
\stick{unavoidably brought the thumb into}
\stick{action\tsk and the forefinger and thumb}
\stick{being once engaged, as naturally brought}
\stick{in the whole hand. Thine, dear uncle}
\stick{Toby!\@ was never now in it’s\sic\ right place}
\stick{\tsh Mrs.\@ Wadman had it ever to take} 
\stick{up, or, with the gentlest pushings, pro-}
\stick{trusions, and equivocal compressions,}
\natch{that}
\stick{that a hand to be removed is capable of}
\stick{receiving\tsk to get it press’d a hair}
breadth of one side out of her way.

Whilst this was doing, how could she\break
\stck{forget to make him sensible, that it was her}
\stck{leg (and no one’s else) at the bottom of the} 
\stck{sentry-box, which slightly press’d against}
\stick{the calf of his\tsk So that my uncle} 
\stick{Toby being thus attacked and sore}
\stick{push’d on both his wings\tsh was it a}
\stick{wonder, if now and then, it put his}
centre into disorder?\tsh

\dropcap{T}{hese} attacks of Mrs.\@ Wadman,\break
you will readily conceive to be of\break
\stick{different kinds; varying from each other,} 
\stick{like the attacks which history is full of,}
\stick{and from the same reasons. A general}
\stick{looker on, would scarce allow them to be}
\stick{attacks at all\tsh or if he did, would}
\stick{confound them all together\tsh but I} 
\stick{write not to them: it will be time enough} 
\stick{to be a little more exact in my descrip-}

\stick{which will not be for some chapters;}
\stick{having nothing more to add in this, but}
\stick{that in a bundle of original papers and} 
\stick{drawings which my father took care to} 
\stick{roll up by themselves, there is a plan of}\catch{Bouchain}
\stick{Bouchain in perfect preservation (and}
\stick{shall be kept so, whilst I have power to}
\stck{preserve any thing) upon the lower corner}
\stick{of which, on the right hand side, there}
\stick{is still remaining the marks of a snuffy}
\stick{finger and thumb, which there is all the} 
\stick{reason in the world to imagine, were}
\stick{Mrs.\@ Wadman’s; for the opposite side}
\stick{of the margin, which I suppose to have}
\stck{been my uncle Toby’s, is absolutely clean:}
\stick{This seems an authenticated record of} 
\stick{one of these attacks; for there are vestigia}
\stick{of the two punctures partly grown up,}
\stick{but still visible on the opposite corner of} 
\stick{the map, which are unquestionably the}
\stick{very holes, through which it has been} 
pricked up in the sentry-box\tsh

By all that is priestly! I value this\break

A soldier, cried my uncle Toby, inter-\break

\tsh Thou art right, Trim, in both\break

\stick{continued the corporal, is the reason, that} 
\stick{from the beginning of their demolition} 
\stick{to the end\tsh I have never once whist-}

\stick{uncle Toby, to say any thing else; and}
\stick{was a man to puzzle his brains till}
\stick{Doom’s day, I believe, Trim, it would be}
impossible.

The corporal perceiving my uncle\break
\stick{Toby was in the right, and that it would} 
\stick{be in vain for the wit of man to think} 
\stick{of extracting a purer moral from his cap,} 
\stick{without further attempting it, he put it} 
\stick{on; and passing his hand across his fore-}
\natch{head} 
\stick{head to rub out a pensive wrinkle,} 
\stick{which the text and the doctrine between} 
\stick{them had engender’d, he return’d, with} 
\stick{the same look and tone of voice, to his}
\stick{story of the king of Bohemia and his}
seven castles.

\tsh To tell thee truly, Trim, quoth\break

\tsh Thou would’st have said \textit{chro}-\break

\stick{for as for geography, ’tis of absolute}

\stick{he should know every town and city,}

\stck{the roads, and hollow ways which lead up}

Is it else to be conceived, corporal,\break
\stick{continued my uncle Toby, rising up in his}
\stick{sentry-box, as he began to warm in this}
\natch{part} 
\stick{part of his discourse\tsk how Marlborough} 
\stick{could have marched his army from the}

\stick{single day’s march without the aids of}
\stick{\textit{Geography}\tsh As for \textit{Chronology}, I own,} 
\stick{Trim, continued my uncle Toby, sitting} 
\stick{down again coolly in his sentry-box,} 
\stick{that of all others, it seems a science which} 
\stick{the soldier might best spare, was it not} 
\stick{for the lights which that science must one} 
\stick{day give him, in determining the inven-}
\stick{tion of powder; the furious execution of}
\stick{which, renversing every thing like thun-}
\stick{der before it, has become a new æra to} 
\stck{us of military improvements, changing so}
\stick{totally the nature of attacks and defences}
\stick{both by sea and land, and awakening so} 
\stick{much art and skill in doing it, that the} 
\stick{world cannot be too exact in ascertaining}
\stick{the precise time of its discovery, or too} 
\stick{inquisitive in knowing what great man}
\natch{was}
\stick{was the discoverer, and what occasions} 
gave birth to it.

I am far from controverting, conti-\break
\stick{nued my uncle Toby, what historians} 
\stick{agree in, that in the year of our Lord} 
\stick{1380, under the reign of Wencelaus,} 
\stick{son of Charles the fourth\tsh a certain}
\stck{priest, whose name was Schwartz, shew’d}
\stick{the use of powder to the Venetians, in}
\stick{their wars against the Genoese; but ’tis}
\stick{certain he was not the first; because if}
\stick{we are to believe Don Pedro the bishop}
\stick{of Leon\tsk How came priests and bishops,}
\stick{an’ please your honour, to trouble their}
\stick{heads so much about gun-powder? God}
\stick{knows, said my uncle Toby\tsh his pro-}

\stick{\tsk and he avers, in his chronicle of King}
\stick{Alphonsus, who reduced Toledo, That}
\natch{in} 
\stick{in the year 1343, which was full thirty} 
\stick{seven years before that time, the secret}

\stick{Christians, not only in their sea-combats,} 
\stick{at that period, but in many of their most} 
\stick{memorable sieges in Spain and Barbary\tsk}
\stick{And all the world knows, that Friar}

\stick{And that the Chinese, added my uncle} 
\stick{Toby, embarrass us, and all accounts of}

quoth Trim.

My uncle Toby, tho’ in the utmost\break

\stick{could not have been propell’d to the sea,}

happen’d no way.\patch{The}

The corporal made the bow of un-\break

Now the King of Bohemia with his\break

\stck{Bohemia and his queen might have walk’d}
\stick{out, or let it alone;\tsh ’twas a matter of}
\stick{contingency, which might happen, or} 
not, just as chance ordered it.

King William was of an opinion, an’\break
\stick{please your honour, quoth Trim, that} 
\stick{every thing was predestined for us in this} 
\stick{world; insomuch, that he would often} 
\stick{say to his soldiers, that \lqq every ball had}
\stick{it’s\sic billet.\,” He was a great man, said} 
\stick{my uncle Toby\tsh And I believe, con-}
\natch{tinued} 
\stick{tinued Trim, to this day, that the shot}
\stick{which disabled me at the battle of Lan-}

\stick{never, Trim, be construed otherwise,} 
said my uncle Toby.

The heart, both of the master and the\break

\tight{Besides, said the corporal, resuming the}\break
\stick{discourse\tsk but in a gayer accent\tsh if it}
\stick{had not been for that single shot, I had}
\stick{never, ’an please your honour, been in}

\tight{Your honour remembers with concern,}\break
\stick{said the corporal, the total rout and}

\stick{for the regiments of Wyndham, Lum-}
\stick{ley, and Galway, which covered the re-}
\natch{treat} 
\stick{treat over the bridge of Neerspeeken,}
\stick{the king himself could scarce have gain’d}
\stick{it\tsh he was press’d hard, as your ho-}
nour knows, on every side of him\tsh

Gallant mortal! cried my uncle Toby, 
\stck{caught up with enthusiasm\tsk this moment,}
\stick{now that all is lost, I see him galloping}
\stick{across me, corporal, to the left, to bring}
\stick{up the remains of the English horse}
\stick{along with him to support the right, and}
\stick{tear the laurel from Luxembourg’s}
\stick{brows, if yet ’tis possible\tsh I see him}
\stick{with the knot of his scarfe just shot off,}

\stick{ven! cried my uncle Toby\tsk he deserves}
\natch{a} 
\stick{a crown \tsh As richly, as a thief a halter;} 
shouted Trim.

My uncle Toby knew the corporal’s
loyalty;\tsk otherwise the comparison was
not at all to his mind\tsh it did not
altogether strike the corporal’s fancy when
he had made it\tsh but it could not be
recall’d\tsh so he had nothing to do, but
proceed.

As the number of wounded was prodigious,
and no one had time to think of any thing,
but his own safety\tsk Though Talmash, said
my uncle Toby, brought off the foot with
great prudence\tsh\break But I was left
upon the field, said the corporal. Thou
wast so; poor fellow! replied my uncle
Toby\tsk So that it was noon the next day,
continued the cor-\catch{poral,} poral,
before I was exchanged, and put into a cart
with thirteen or fourteen more, in order to
be convey’d to our\break hospital.

There is no part of the body, an’ please
your honour, where a wound occasions more
intolerable anguish than upon the knee\tsh

Except the groin; said my uncle Toby. An’
please your honour, replied the corporal,
the knee, in my opinion, must certainly be
the most acute, there being so many tendons
and what-d’ye-call-’ems all about it.

It is for that reason, quoth my uncle Toby,
that the groin is infinitely more
sensible\tsh there being not only as
ma-\catch{ny} ny tendons and
what-d’ye-call-’ems (for I know their names
as little as thou do’st)\tsh about it\tsh
but moreover\break \astW3\tsh

Mrs.\@ Wadman, who had been all the time in
her arbour\tsk instantly stopp’d her\break
breath\tsk unpinn’d her mob at the chin,
and stood upon one leg\tsh

The dispute was maintained with ami\-cable
and equal force betwixt my uncle Toby and
Trim for some time; till Trim at length
recollecting that he had often cried at his
master’s sufferings, but never shed a tear
at his own\tsk was for giving up the point,
which my uncle Toby would not allow\tsh
’Tis a proof of nothing, Trim, said he, but
the generosity of thy temper\tsh\patch{So}

So that whether the pain of a wound in the
groin (cæteris paribus) is greater than the
pain of a wound in the knee\tsh or

Whether the pain of a wound in the knee is
not greater than the pain of a wound in the
groin\tsh are points which to this day
remain unsettled.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XX.}

\dropcap{T}{he} anguish of my knee,
continued the corporal, was excessive in
itself; and the uneasiness of the cart,
with the roughness of the roads, which were
terribly cut up\tsk making bad still
worse\tsk every step was death to me: so
that with the loss of blood, and
the\catch{want} want of care-taking of me,
and a fever I~felt coming on besides\tsh
(Poor soul!\break said my uncle Toby) all
together, an’ please your honour, was more
than I could sustain.

I was telling my sufferings to a young woman at
a peasant’s house, where our cart, which was the
last of the line, had 
\stick{halted; they had help’d me in, and the}
\stick{young woman had taken a cordial out of}
\stick{her pocket and dropp’d it upon some su-}
\stick{gar, and seeing it had cheer’d me, she had}
\stick{given it me a second and a third time\tsh}
\stick{So I was telling her, an’ please your ho-}
\stick{nour, the anguish I was in, and was}
\stick{saying it was so intolerable to me, that I}
\stick{had much rather lie down upon the bed,}
\stick{turning my face towards one which was}
in the corner of the room\tsk and die,\catch{than}
than go on\tsh when, upon her attempting to lead
me to it, I fainted away in her arms. She was a
good soul! as your honour, said the corporal,
wiping his eyes, will hear.

I thought \textit{love} had been a joyous
thing, quoth my uncle Toby.

’Tis the most serious thing, an’ please
your honour (sometimes) that is in the
world.

By the persuasion of the young woman,
continued the corporal, the cart with the
wounded men set off without me: she had
assured them I should expire immediately if
I was put into the cart. So when I came to
myself\tsh I found myself in a still quiet
cottage, with\catch{no} no one but the
young woman, and the peasant and his wife.
I was laid across the bed in the corner of
the room, with my wounded leg upon a chair,
and the young woman beside me, holding the
corner of her handkerchief dipp’d in
vinegar to my nose with one hand, and
rubbing my temples with the other.

I took her at first for the daughter of the
peasant (for it was no inn)\tsk so had
offer’d her a little purse with eighteen
florins, which my poor brother Tom (here
Trim wip’d his eyes) had sent me as a
token, by a recruit, just before he set out
for Lisbon\tsh

\tsh I never told your honour that piteous story
yet\tsh here Trim wiped his eyes a third time.\patch{The}

The young woman call’d the old man 
\stick{and his wife into the room, to shew}
\stick{them the money, in order to gain me}
\stick{credit for a bed and what little ne-}
\stick{cessaries I should want, till I should be}
\stick{in a condition to be got to the hospital}
\stick{\tsh Come then! said she, tying up the}
\stick{little purse\tsk I’ll be your banker\tsk but as}
\stick{that office alone will not keep me em-}
ploy’d, I’ll be your nurse too.

I thought by her manner of speaking\break
this, as well as by her dress, which~I then
began to consider more
attentively\break\tsk that the young woman
could not be the daughter of the peasant.

She was in black down to her toes, with her
hair conceal’d under a cambrick border,
laid close to her forehead: she\catch{was}
was one of those kind of nuns, an’ please

Spanish Netherlands\tsk\break \stick{except

\tsh She often told me, quoth Trim, she did
it for the love of Christ\tsk I did not

wrong, said my uncle Toby\tsk
we’ll\catch{ask} ask Mr.\@ Yorick about it

The young Beguine, continued the corporal, had scarce
given herself time to tell me \lqq she would be my nurse,”\break
when she hastily turned about to begin the office of one, and
prepare something for me\tsh and in a short
time\tsk though I\break thought it a long one\tsk she came back with
flannels, \etc \etc and having fomented my knee soundly for a
couple of hours, \etc and made me a thin basin of gruel for my

whole night long was the fair Beguine, like an angel, close
by my bedside, holding back my curtain and offering me
cordials\tsk and I was only awakened from my dream by her coming
there at the hour promised, and giving them in
re\-ality. In truth,
she was scarce ever from me; and so accustomed was I to receive
life from her hands, that my heart sickened, and I lost colour when
she left the room: and yet, continued the corporal \catch{(making}

\initial{I}{Had} escaped, continued the
corporal, all that time from falling in love, and had gone on to
the end of the chapter, had it not been predestined
otherwise\tsh\break there is no resisting our fate.

It was on a Sunday, in the afternoon, as I told your
honour.

The old man and his wife had walked
out\tsh

Every thing was still and hush as midnight about the
house\tsh

There was not so much as a duck or a duckling about the
yard\tsh\patch{\tsh When}

\tsh When the fair Beguine came in to see
me.

My wound was then in a fair way of doing well\tsh the
inflammation had been gone off for some time, but it was succeeded
with an itching both above and 
\stick{below my knee, so insufferable, that I}
\stick{had not shut my eyes the whole night}
for it.

Let me see it, said she, kneeling down upon the ground parallel
to my knee, and laying her hand upon the part below
it\tsh It only wants rubbing a little, said the
Beguine; so covering it with the bed cloaths, she began with
the forefinger of her right-hand to rub under my knee, guiding her
fore-finger backwards and\catch{forwards} forwards by the edge of the flannel which
kept on the dressing.

In five or six minutes I felt slightly the end of
her second finger\tsk and presently it was laid flat with the
other, and she continued rubbing in that way round and round for a
good while; it then came into my head, that I should fall in
love\tsk\break I blush’d when I saw how white a hand she
had\tsk I shall never, an’ please your honour, behold
another hand so white whilst I live\tsh

\tsh Not in that place: said my uncle
Toby\tsh

Though it was the most serious des\-pair in nature to the
corporal\tsk he could not forbear smiling.\patch{The}

The young Beguine, continued the corporal, perceiving it
was of great service to me\tsk from rubbing for some time, with
two fingers\tsk proceeded to rub at length, with three\tsk till
by little and little she brought down the fourth, and then
rubb’d with her whole hand: I will never say another word,
an’ please your honour, upon hands again\tsk but it was
softer than satin\tsh

\tsh Prithee, Trim, commend it as much as thou
wilt, said my uncle Toby; I shall hear thy story with the
more delight\tsh The corporal thank’d his master
most unfeignedly; but having nothing to say upon the
Beguine’s hand, but the same over again\tsh he
proceeded to the effects of it.\patch{The}

The fair Beguine, said the corporal, continued rubbing with her whole
hand under my knee\tsk till I fear’d her zeal would weary
her\tsh \lqq I would do a\break
\lqq thousand times more,” said she, \lqq for\break
\lqq the love of Christ”\tsh In saying which\break
she pass’d her hand across the flannel, to\break
the part above my knee, which I had\break
equally complained of, and rubb’d it\break
also.


I perceived, then, I was beginning to be in
love\tsh

As she continued rub-rub-rubbing\tsk I felt it spread from
under her hand, an’ please your honour, to every part of my
frame\tsh

The more she rubb’d, and the longer strokes she
took\tsh the more the fire\catch{kindled} kindled in my veins \tsh till at length, by
two or three strokes longer than the\break rest\tsh my passion
rose to the highest pitch\tsh I seiz’d her
hand\tsh

\tsh And then, thou clapped’st it to\break thy lips,
Trim, said my uncle Toby\tsh\break and madest a
speech.

Whether the corporal’s amour terminated precisely in the
way my uncle Toby described it, is not material; it is
enough that it contain'd in it the essence of all the love-romances
which ever have been wrote since the beginning of the world.

the story of his amour\tsh or rather my uncle Toby for
him\tsk Mrs.\break Wadman silently sallied forth from her
arbour, replaced the pin in her mob, pass’d the wicker gate,
and advanced slowly towards my uncle Toby’s
sentry-box: the disposition which Trim had made in my uncle
Toby’s mind, was too favourable a crisis to be let
slipp’d\tsh

\tsh The attack was determin’d upon: it was facilitated still more by my uncle
Toby’s having ordered the corporal to wheel off the pioneer’s shovel, the spade, the
pick-axe, the picquets, and other\catch{military} military stores which lay scatter’d upon the
ground where Dunkirk stood\tsk The 
\stck{corporal had march’d\tsk the field was clear.}

Now consider, sir, what nonsense it is, either in fighting, or
writing, or any thing else (whether in rhyme to it, or not) which a
man has occasion to do\tsk\break to act by plan: for if ever Plan,
independent of all circumstances, deserved registering in letters
of gold (I mean in the archives of Gotham)\tsk it was
certainly the \textsc{Plan} of Mrs.\@ Wadman’s
attack of my uncle Toby in his sentry-box, \textsc{by}
\stick{\textsc{Plan}\tsh Now the Plan hanging up in} 
\stick{it at this juncture, being the Plan of Dun-}
kirk\tsk and the tale
of Dunkirk a tale of relaxation, it opposed every impression
she could make: and besides, could she have gone upon it\tsk the
manœuvre of\catch{fingers} fingers and hands in the attack of the
sentry-box, was so outdone by that of the fair Beguine’s, in Trim’s
story\tsk that just then, that particular attack, however
successful before\tsk became the most heartless attack that could
be made\tsh

O! let woman alone for this. Mrs.\@ Wadman had scarce
open’d the wicker-gate, when her genius sported with the
change of circumstances.

\tsh She formed a new attack in a moment.

\tsh Great God! what must my uncle Toby’s
have been, when ’twas all benignity without it.\patch{My}

My father, as appears from many of his papers, was very subject
to this passion, before he married\tsh but from a little
subacid kind of drollish impatience in his nature, whenever it
befell him, he would never submit to it like a christian; but would
pish, and huff, and bounce, and kick, and play the Devil, and write
the bitterest Philippicks against the eye that ever man
wrote\tsh there is one in verse upon some body’s eye
or other, that for two or three nights together, had put him by his
rest; which in his first transport of resentment against it, he
begins thus:

In short, during the whole paroxism, my father was all abuse and foul language,
approaching rather towards malediction\tsh only he did not do it with as much method
as Ernulphus\tsh he was\break too impetuous; nor with Ernulphus’s policy\tsh for tho’ my
father, with the most intolerant spirit, would curse both this and that, and every
thing under heaven, which was either aiding or abetting to his love\tsh yet never
concluded his chapter of curses upon it, without cursing himself in at the bargain,
as one of the most egregious fools and cox-\break combs, he would say, that ever was let
loose in the world.

My uncle Toby, on the contrary, took it like a
lamb\tsh sat still and let the\catch{poison} poison work in his veins
without resistance\tsh in the sharpest exacerbations of
his wound (like that on his groin) he never dropt one fretful or
discontented word\tsh he blamed neither heaven nor
earth\tsh or thought or spoke an inju\-rious thing of any
body, or any part of it; he sat solitary and pensive with his
pipe\tsh looking at his lame leg \tsh\break 
\stck{then whiffing out a sentimental heigh ho!}
which mixing with the smoak, incommoded no one
mortal.

He took it like a lamb\tsh I say.


In truth he had mistook it at first; for having taken a ride with my father, that
very morning, to save if possible a beautiful wood, which the dean and chapter\catch{were} were

\dropcap{I}{f} any thing in this world, which my\break

time he was in love, it was the perverse use my father was always
making of an expression of Hilarion the hermit; who, in
speaking of his abstinence, his watchings, flagellations, and other
instrumental parts of his religion\tsk would say\tsk tho’
with more facetiousness than became an
hermit\tsk \lqq That they were the means he used, to make
his \textit{ass} (meaning his body) leave off
kicking.”\patch{It}

It pleased my father well; it was not only a laconick way of
expressing\tsh\break
but of libelling, at the same time, the desires and appetites of
the lower part of us; so that for many years of my father’s
life, ’twas his constant mode of expression\tsk he never used
the word \textit{passions} once\tsk but \textit{ass} always
instead of them\tsh So that he might be said truly, to have been
upon the bones, or the back of his own ass, or else of some
other man’s, during all that time.

I must here observe to you, the difference betwixt\\
\null\qquad My father’s ass\\
\null\qquad and my hobby-horse\tsk in order to keep
characters as separate as may be, in our fancies as we go
along.\patch{For}

For my hobby-horse, if you recollect a little, is no way a
vicious beast; he has scarce one hair or lineament of the ass about
him\tsh ’Tis the sporting little filly-folly which
carries you out for the present hour\tsk a
maggot, a butterfly,\break a

And so the discourse went on without him.

Every body, said my mother, says\break
you are in love, brother Toby\tsk and we\break
hope it is true.

I am as much in love, sister, I believe, replied my uncle
Toby, as any man usually is\tsk Humph! said my
father\tsk\break and when did you know it? quoth my
mother\tsh

\tsh When the blister broke; replied my uncle
Toby.

My uncle Toby’s reply put my father into good

\dropcap[findent=0pt]{A}{s} the ancients agree, brother Toby, said my father, that there are two
different and distinct kinds of \textit{love}, according to the different parts
which are affected by it\tsk the Brain or Liver\tsh I think when a man is in love, it
behoves him a little to consider which of the two he is fallen into.

What signifies it, brother Shandy, replied my uncle
Toby, which of the two it is, provided it will
but make a man marry, and love his wife, and get
a few children.

\tsh A few children! cried my father, rising out of his
chair, and looking full\catch{in} in my mother’s face, as he forced his
way betwixt her’s and doctor Slop’s\tsk a few children! cried my father, repeating my uncle
Toby’s words as he walk’d to and
fro’\tsh

\tsh Not, my dear brother Toby, cried my father, recovering
himself all at once, and coming close up to the back of my uncle
Toby’s chair\tsk not that I should be\break sorry had’st thou a
score\tsk on the contrary, I should rejoice\tsk and be as kind,
Toby, to every one of them as a father\tsk 

My uncle Toby stole his hand unperceived behind his
chair, to give my father’s a squeeze\tsh

\tsh Nay, moreover, continued he,\break
\stick{keeping hold of my uncle Toby’s hand}
\stick{\tsk so much do’st thou possess, my dear}\catch{Toby,}
\stick{Toby, of the milk of human nature,}
\stick{and so little of its asperities\tsk ’tis piteous}
\stick{the world is not peopled by creatures}
\stick{which resemble thee; and was I an Asia-}
\stick{tick monarch, added my father, heating}
\stick{himself with his new project\tsk I would}
\stick{oblige thee, provided it would not impair}
\stick{thy strength\tsk or dry up thy radical mois-}
\stick{ture too fast\tsk or weaken thy memory or}
\stick{fancy, brother Toby, which these gym-}
\stick{nicks inordinately taken are apt to do\tsk}
\stick{else, dear Toby, I would procure thee}
\stick{the most beautiful woman in my empire,}
\stick{and I would oblige thee, \textit{nolens, volens}, to}
beget for me one subject every \textit{month}\tsh

As my father pronounced the last word of the sentence\tsk my
mother took a pinch of snuff.\patch{Now}

Now I would not, quoth my uncle
\stick{Toby, get a child, \textit{nolens, volens}, that}
\stick{is, whether I would or no, to please the}
greatest prince upon earth\tsh

\tsh And ’twould be cruel in me, brother
Toby, to compell thee; said my father\tsk but ’tis a
case put to shew thee, that it is not thy begetting a
child\break
\tsk in case thou should’st be able\tsk but the
system of Love and Marriage thou goest upon, which I would set thee
right in\tsh

There is at least, said Yorick, a great deal of reason
and plain sense in captain Shandy’s opinion of love;
and ’tis amongst the ill spent hours of my life
\stick{which I have to answer for, that I have}
\stick{read so many flourishing poets and rhe-}
\stick{toricians in my time, from whom I never}
could extract so much\tsh\etp\patch{I wish,}
I wish, Yorick, said my father, you\break 
had read Plato; for there you would have learnt that there are two
\textsc{Loves}\tsk\break 
\stick{I know there were two \textsc{Religions}, re-}
\stick{plied Yorick, amongst the ancients\tsh}
one\tsk for the vulgar, and another for the
learned;\tsk but I think \textsc{one Love}
might have served both of them very well\tsk 

It could not; replied my father\tsk and for the same reasons:
for of these Loves, according to Ficinus’s comment
upon Velasius, the one is \textit{rational}\tsh\\
\null\quad\tsh the other is \textit{natural}\tsh \\
the first ancient\tsh without mother \tsh\break where
Venus had nothing to do: the second, begotten of
Jupiter and Dione\tsk

\tsh Pray, brother, quoth my uncle Toby, what
has a man who believes in God to do with this? My father could\catch{not}
\bgroup\parskip=3pt plus 3pt%
not stop to answer, for fear of breaking the
thread of his discourse\tsh

This latter, continued he, partakes wholly of
the nature of Venus.

The first, which is the golden chain let down
from heaven, excites to love heroic, which
comprehends in it, and excites to the desire of
philosophy and truth\tsh the second, excites to
\textit{desire}, simply\tsh

\tsh I think the procreation of children as beneficial
to the world, said Yorick, as the finding out the
longitude\tsh

\tsh To be sure, said my mother, \textit{love} keeps
peace in the world\tsh

\tsh In the \textit{house}\tsk my dear, I
own\tsk \break
\null\tsh It replenishes the earth; said my
mother\tsh

But it keeps heaven empty\tsk my dear; replied my father.
\egroup

\etp\rightline{\tsh ’Tis}

\tsk ’Tis Virginity, cried Slop,
triumphantly, which fills paradise.

Well push’d nun! quoth my father.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XXXIV.}

\dropcap{M}{y} father had such a skirmishing, cutting kind of a slashing way 
\stick{with him in his disputations, thrusting} 
\stick{and ripping, and giving every one a}
\stick{stroke to remember him by in his turn\tsk}
\stick{that if there were twenty people in com-}
\stick{pany\tsk in less than half an hour he was}
\stick{\tight{sure to have every one of ’em against him.}\hss}

\noindent
\stick{\indent\tight{What did not a little contribute to leave}}
\stick{him thus without an ally, was, that if}
\stick{there was any one post more untenable}
\stick{than the rest, he would be sure to throw}
\stick{himself into it; and to do him justice,}
\stick{when he was once there, he would defend}\catch{it} it so gallantly,
that ’twould have been a concern, either to a brave man or
a\break
good-natured one, to have seen him\break
driven out.

Yorick, for this reason, though he would often attack
him\tsk yet could never bear to do it with all his force.

Doctor Slop’s \textsc{Virginity}, in the
close of the last chapter, had got him for once on the right side
of the rampart; and he was beginning to blow up all the convents in
Christendom about Slop’s ears, when corporal
Trim came into the parlour to inform my uncle Toby,
that his thin scarlet breeches, in which the attack was to be made
upon Mrs.\@ Wadman, would not do; for that the taylor, in
ripping them up, in order to turn them, had found they had been
turn’d\catch{before} before\tsh Then turn them again, bro-\break ther,
said my father, rapidly, for there will be many a turning of
’em yet before all’s done in the
affair\tsh They are as rotten as dirt, said the
corporal\tsh\break Then by all means, said my father, bespeak a
new pair, brother\tsh for though I know, continued my
father, turning himself to the company, that widow Wadman
has been deeply in love with my brother Toby for many years,
and has used every art and circumvention of woman to outwit him
into the same passion, yet now that she has caught
him\tsh her fever will be pass’d it’s\sic\break
height\tsh

\tsh She has gain’d her point.

In this case, continued my father, which Plato, I am
persuaded, never\catch{thought} thought of\tsh Love, you see, is not so
much a \textsc{Sentiment} as a \textsc{Situation}, into
which a man enters, as my brother Toby would do, into a
\textit{corps}\tsh no matter whether he loves the service or
no\tsh being once in it\tsk he acts as if he did; and
takes every step to shew himself a man of prowesse.

The hypothesis, like the rest of my\break father’s, was
plausible enough, and my uncle Toby had but a single word to
object to it\tsk in which Trim stood ready to second
him\tsh but my father had not drawn his
conclusion\tsh

For this reason, continued my father (stating the case over
again) notwithstanding all the world knows, that Mrs.\catch{Wadman}
Wadman \textit{affects} my brother Toby\tsk and my brother
Toby contrariwise \textit{affects} Mrs.\@ Wadman, and no
obstacle in nature to forbid the music striking up this very night,
yet will I answer for it, that this self-same tune will not be
play’d this twelvemonth.

We have taken our measures badly, quoth my uncle Toby,
looking up interrogatively in Trim’s face.

I would lay my Montero-cap, said
Trim\tsh Now Trim’s
Montero-cap, as\break
\stick{I once told you, was his constant wager;}
and having furbish’d it up that very night, in
order to go upon the attack\tsk it made the odds look more
considerable\break\null\tsh I would lay, an’ please your
honour, my Montero-cap to a shilling\tsk \catch{was} was it proper,
continued Trim (making a bow) to offer a wager before your
honours\tsh

\tsk There is nothing improper in it,
\stick{said my father\tsk ’tis a mode of expres-}
\stick{sion; for in saying thou would’st lay thy}
\stck{Montero-cap to a shilling\tsk all thou mean-}
est is this\tsk that thou believest\tsh

\tsh Now, What do’st thou believe?

That Widow Wadman, an’ please your worship, cannot
hold it out ten days\tsh

\noindent
\stick{\hfill And whence, cried Slop, jeeringly, hast}
\stick{\tight{thou all this knowledge of woman, friend?}\hss}

By falling in love with a popish clergy-woman; said
Trim.

’Twas a Beguine, said my uncle Toby.\patch{Doctor}

Doctor Slop was too much in wrath to listen to the
distinction; and my father taking that very crisis to fall in
helter-skelter upon the whole order of Nuns and Beguines, a
set of silly, fusty, bag-\break gages\tsh Slop could not stand
it\tsh\break and my uncle Toby having some measures to take
about his breeches\tsk and Yorick about his fourth general
division\break\tsk in order for their several attacks next
day\tsk the company broke up: and my father being left alone, and
having half an hour upon his hands betwixt that and bed-time; he
called for pen, ink, and\break paper, and wrote my uncle Toby the
following letter of instructions.

My dear brother Toby,

\vskip -6pt

\dropcap{W}{hat} I am going to say to\break thee is
upon the nature of wo-\break men, and of
love-making to them;\break and perhaps
it is as well for thee\tsk tho’ not so well for
me\tsk that thou hast occasion for a letter of instructions upon
that head, and that I am able to write it to\break thee.

Had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our
lots\tsk and thou no sufferer by the knowledge, I had been well content that thou should’st have
dipp’d the pen this moment into the ink, instead of myself;
but that not being the case\tsh\tsk Mrs Shandy
being now close besides me, preparing for bed\tsh\catch{I have}
I have thrown together without order, and just as they have come into my mind, such
hints and documents as I deem may be of use to thee; intending, in this, to give
thee a token of my love; not doubting, my dear Toby, of the manner in which it will
be accepted.

In the first place, with regard to all which concerns religion
in the affair\tsh\break though I perceive from a glow in my
cheek, that I blush as I begin to speak to thee upon the subject,
as well knowing, notwithstanding thy unaffected secrecy, how few of
its offices thou neglectest\tsk yet I would remind thee of one
(during the continuance of thy courtship) in a particular manner,
which I would not have omitted; and that is, never to go forth upon
the enterprize, whether it be in the morning or the afternoon,
with-\catch{out}
out first recommending thyself to the protection of Almighty
God, that he may defend thee from the evil one.

Shave the whole top of thy crown clean once at least every four
or five days, but oftner if convenient; lest in taking off thy wig
before her, thro’ absence of mind, she should be able to
discover how much has been cut away by Time\tsh how much
by Trim.

\tsh ’Twere better to keep ideas of baldness out of her
fancy.

Always carry it in thy mind, and act upon it, as a sure maxim,
Toby\tsh

\lqq\textit{That women are timid:}\,” And ’tis\break
\stick{well they are\tsk else there would be no}
dealing with them.\patch{Let}

Let not thy breeches be too tight, or hang too loose about thy
thighs, like the trunk-hose of our ancestors.

\tsh A just medium prevents all conclusions.

Whatever thou hast to say, be it more or less, forget not to
utter it in a low soft tone of voice. Silence,
and whatever\break
approaches it, weaves dreams of mid\-night secrecy into the brain:
For this cause, if thou canst help it, never throw down the
tongs and poker.

Avoid all kinds of pleasantry and face-
\stick{tiousness in thy discourse with her, and}
\stick{do whatever lies in thy power at the same}
\stick{time, to keep from her all books and}
\stick{writings which tend thereto: there are}
some devotional tracts, which if thou\catch{canst} canst entice her to read
over\tsk it will be well: but suffer her not to look into
Rabelais, or Scarron, or Don Quixote\tsh

\tsh They are all books which excite laughter; and thou
knowest, dear Toby, \tight{that there is no passion so serious, as
lust.}

Stick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt, before thou enterest her
parlour.

And if thou art permitted to sit upon the same sopha with her,
and she gives thee occasion to lay thy hand upon hers\tsk beware
of taking it\tsh thou can’st not lay thy hand on hers, but she
will feel the temper of thine. Leave that and as many other
things as thou canst, quite undetermined; by so doing, thou wilt
have her curiosity on thy side; and if she is not conquer’d by
that, and thy \textsc{Asse}\catch{continues} continues still kicking, which
there is great reason to suppose\tsh Thou must begin, with first
losing a few ounces of blood below the ears, according to the
practice of the ancient Scythians, who cured the most
intemperate fits of the appetite by that means.

Avicenna, after this, is for having the\break part anointed
with the syrrup of helle\-bore, using proper evacuations and
purges\tsh and I believe rightly. But thou must eat little
or no goat’s flesh,\break nor red deer\tsh nor even
foal’s flesh by\break any means; and carefully
abstain\tsh that is, as much as thou canst, from peacocks,
cranes, coots, didappers, and water-hens\tsh

As for thy drink\tsk I need not tell thee, it must be the
infusion of \textsc{Vervain} and the herb
\textsc{Hanea}, of which Ælian\catch{relates}
\stick{relates such effects\tsk but if thy stomach}
\stick{palls with it\tsk discontinue it from time to}
time, taking cucumbers, melons, purs\-lane, water-lillies, woodbine, and lettice,
in the stead of them.

There is nothing further for thee, which occurs to me at
present\tsh

\tsh Unless the breaking out of a fresh
war\tsh So wishing every thing, dear Toby, for
best,\\[3pt]
\indent I rest thy affectionate brother,\\[3pt]
