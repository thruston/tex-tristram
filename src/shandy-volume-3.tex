My uncle \textit{Toby}’s wish did Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} a
\stck{disservice which his heart never intended} any man,\tsh Sir, it
confounded him\tsh and thereby putting his ideas first into
confusion, and then to flight, he could not rally them again for
the soul of him.

In all disputes,\tsh male or female,\tsh whether for honour, for
profit or for love,\break \tsk it makes no difference in the
case;\tsk nothing is more dangerous, madam, than a wish coming
sideways in this unexpect\-ed manner upon a man: the safest way
in general to take off the force of the wish, is for the party
wished at, instantly to get upon his legs\tsk and wish the
\textit{wisher} something in return, of pretty near the same
value,\tsk so balancing the account upon the spot, you stand as
you were\tsk nay sometimes gain the advantage of the attack by
it.\patch{This}

This will be fully illustrated to the\break
world in my chapter of wishes.\tsh

Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} did not understand the nature of this
defence;\tsk he was puzzled with it, and it put an entire stop
to the dispute for four minutes and a half;\tsk five had been
fatal to it:\tsk my father saw the danger\tsk the dispute was
one of the most interesting disputes in the world,\break
\lqq Whether the child of his prayers and \stick{endeavours
should be born without a} head or with one:”\tsk he waited to
the last moment, to allow Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}, in whose behalf
the wish was made, his right of returning it; but perceiving, I
say, that he was confounded, and continued looking with that
perplexed vacuity of eye which puzzled souls generally stare
with,\break
\tsh first in my uncle \textit{Toby}’s face\tsk then
in his\tsk then up\tsk then down\tsk then\catch{east} 
east\tsk east and by east, and so on,\tsh coasting it along by the plinth of the
wainscot till he had got to the opposite point of the
compass,\tsh and that he had actually begun to count the brass
nails upon the arm of his chair\tsk my father thought there was
no time to be lost with my uncle \textit{Toby}, so took up the
discourse as follows.

\null
\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  II.}

\dropcap{\lower-10pt\hbox{\large “}%
\leaders\hrule width 1pt height 14.14pt depth -13.4pt\hskip .5em\thinspace W}{hat}
prodigious armies\break you had in \textit{Flanders!}\,”\tsh

Brother \textit{Toby}, replied my father, taking his wig from
off his head with his right hand, and with his \textit{left}
pulling out a striped \textit{India} handkerchief from his right
coat pocket, in order to rub his head,\catch{as} as he argued the point
with my uncle \textit{Toby.}\tsh

\tsh Now, in this I think my father was much to blame;
and I will give you my reasons for it.

Matters of no more seeming consequence in themselves than,
\lqq\textit{Whether\break
my father should have taken off his wig\break
with his right hand or with his left},”\tsh\break
have divided the greatest kingdoms, and made the crowns of the
monarchs who governed them, to totter upon their\break
heads.\tsk But need I tell you, Sir, that the circumstances with
which every thing in this world is begirt, give every thing in
this world its size and shape;\tsk and by tightening it, or
relaxing it, this way or that, make the thing to be, what it
is\tsh\break great\tsk little\tsk good\tsk bad\tsk
indifferent\catch{\lower1pt\hbox{o}r\rlap{\quad\club}} or not indifferent, just
as the case happens.

As my father’s \textit{India} handkerchief was in his right coat pocket, he should
by no means have suffered his right hand to have got engaged: on the contrary,
instead of taking off his wig with it, as he did, he ought to have committed that
entirely to the left; and then, when the natural exigency my father was under of
rubbing his head, call’d out for his handkerchief, he would have had nothing in the
world to have done, but to have put his right hand into his right coat pocket and
taken it out;\tsk which he might have done without any violence, or the least
ungraceful twist in any one tendon or muscle of his whole body.

In this case, (unless, indeed, my father\catch{had} had been resolved to make a fool of himself
by holding the wig stiff in his left \stick{hand\tsk or by making some nonsensical} angle or
other at his elbow joint, or arm\-pit)\tsk his whole attitude had been easy\tsk natural\tsk
unforced: \textit{Reynolds} himself, as great and gracefully as he paints, might
have painted him as he sat.

Now, as my father managed this matter,\tsk consider what a
devil of a figure my father made of himself.

\tsk In the latter end of Queen \textit{Anne}’s reign, and in the beginning of the
reign of King \textit{George} the first\tsk \lqq\textit{Coat pockets were cut very low
down in the skirt.}”\tsh I need say no more\tsh the father of mischief, had he been
hammering at it a month, could not have contrived a worse fashion for one in my
father’s situation.\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  III.}

\dropcap[findent=2pt]{I}{t} was not an easy matter in any
king’s reign (unless you were as lean a subject as myself) to
have forced your hand diagonally, quite across your whole body, so
as to gain the bottom of your opposite coat-pocket.\tsh In
the year, one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, when this
happened, it was extremely difficult; so that when my uncle
\textit{Toby} discovered the transverse zig-zaggery of my
father’s approaches towards it, it instantly brought into his
mind those he had done duty in, before the gate of
St.\@ \textit{Nicolas};\tsk the idea of which drew off his attention so
entirely from the subject in debate, that he had got his right
hand to the bell to ring up \textit{Trim}, to go and fetch
his map of \textit{Namur}, and his compasses and sector\catch{along} along with
it, to measure the returning angles of the traverses of that
attack,\tsk but particularly of that one, where he received his
wound upon his groin.

My father knit his brows, and as he knit them, all the blood in
his body seem\-ed to rush up into his face\tsh my uncle
\textit{Toby} dismounted immediately.

\initial{A}{Man}’s body and his mind, with
the utmost reverence to both I speak it, are exactly like a jerkin,
and a jerkin’s lining;\tsk rumple the one,\tsk you rumple
the other. There is one certain exception however in this case, and
that is,\catch{when} when you are so fortunate a fellow, as to have had your
jerkin made of gum-taffeta, and the body-lining to it, of a
sarcenet, or thin persian.

\textit{Zeno}, \textit{Cleanthes}, \textit{Diogenes Babylonius}, 
\textit{Dionysius Heracleotes}, \textit{Antipater}, \textit{Panætius} and
\textit{Possidonius} amongst the \textit{Greeks};\tsh \textit{Cato} and
\textit{Varro} and \textit{Seneca} amongst the \textit{Romans};\tsk
\textit{Pantenus} and \textit{Clemens Alexan\-drinus} and \textit{Montaigne} amongst
the Christians; and a score and a half of good, ho-\break
\stck{nest, unthinking, \textit{Shandean} people as ever}
lived, whose names I can’t recollect,\tsk all pretended that their
jerkins were made after this fashion,\tsk you might have rumpled and crumpled, and
doubled and\break creased, and fretted and fridged the outsides of them all to pieces;\tsk
in short, you might have played the very devil with them, and at the same time,
not\catch{one}
one of the insides of ’em would have been one button the worse, for all you had
done to them.

I believe in my conscience that mine is made up somewhat after
this sort:\tsh\break
for never poor jerkin has been tickled\break
off at such a rate as it has been these last nine months
together,\tsk and yet I de-\break clare the lining to
it,\tsk as far as I am a judge of the
matter, is not a three-penny piece the worse;\tsk pell mell,
hel-\break ter skelter, ding dong, cut and thrust,\break back stroke and fore
stroke, side way and long way, have they been trimming it for
me:\tsk had there been the least gumminess in my lining,\tsk by
heaven! it had all of it long ago been fray’d and\break
fretted to a thread.

\tsk You Messrs.\@ the monthly
Review-\catch{ers!} ers!\tsh how could you cut and slash my jerkin as
you did?\tsh how did you know, but you would cut my lining
too?

Heartily and from my soul, to the protection of that Being who
will injure none of us, do I recommend you and your
affairs,\tsk so God bless you;\tsk only next month, if any one
of you should gnash his teeth, and storm and rage at me, as some of
you did last \textsc{May}, (in which I remember the weather
was very hot)\tsk don’t be exasperated, if I pass it by
again with good temper,\tsk being determined as long as I live or
write (which in my case means the same thing) never to give the
honest gentleman a worse word or a worse wish, than my uncle \textit{Toby} gave
the fly which buzz’d about his nose all
\textit{dinner time}, \tsh \lqq Go,\tsh go, poor
devil,\,” quoth he, “\tsh get thee gone,\tsh why\catch{\lqq should}

must have redden’d, pictorically and scientifically speaking, six
whole tints and a half, if not a full octave above his natural

our children are beset with, after they are got forth into the
world, are enow,\tsk little need is there to expose them to
unnecessary ones in their passage to it.\tsk Are these dangers,
quoth my uncle \textit{Toby}, laying his hand upon my father’s
knee, and looking up \stick{seriously in his face for an
answer,\tsk are} \stick{these dangers greater now o’\,days,
bro-} ther, than in times past? Brother \textit{Toby}, answered
my father, if a child was but fairly begot, and born alive, and
healthy, and the mother did well after it,\tsk our forefathers
never looked further.\tsh My uncle \textit{Toby} instantly
withdrew his hand from off my father’s knee, reclined his body
gently back in his chair, raised his head till he could just see
the cornish of the room, and then directing the
buccina-\break
tory muscles along his cheeks, and the\catch{orbi-} 
orbicular muscles around his lips to do their duty\tsk he
whistled \textit{Lillabullero.}

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  VII.}

\dropcap[findent=2pt]{W}{hilst} \tight{my uncle \textit{Toby} was whist-}\break
ling \textit{Lillabullero} to my father,\tsk\break Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}
was stamping, and cursing and damning at \textit{Obadiah} at a most
dreadful rate,\tsh it would have done your heart good, and
cured you, Sir, for ever, of the vile sin of swearing, to have heard
him.\tsk I am determined therefore to relate the whole affair to
you.

When Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}’s maid delivered the green bays bag
with her master’s instruments in it, to \textit{Obadiah}, she
very sensibly exhorted him to put his head and one arm through
the strings, and ride with it slung across his body: so undoing
the\catch{bow-}
bow-knot, to lengthen the strings for\break him, without any
more ado, she helped him on with it. However, as this, in some
measure, unguarded the mouth of the bag, lest any thing should
bolt out in galloping back, at the speed \textit{Obadiah}
threatened, they consulted to take it off again; and in the
great care and caution of their hearts, they had taken the two
strings and tied them close (pursing up the mouth of the bag
first) with half a dozen hard knots, each of which,
\textit{Obadiah}, to make all safe, had twitched and drawn
together with all the strength of\break his body.

This answered all that \textit{Obadiah} and the maid intended;
but was no remedy against some evils which neither he or she
foresaw.  The instruments, it seems, as tight as the bag was
tied above, had\catch{so} 
so much room to play in it, towards the bottom, (the shape of
the bag being conical) that \textit{Obadiah} could not make a
trot of it, but with such a terrible jingle, what with the
\textit{tire-téte}, \textit{forceps}, and \textit{squirt}, as
\tight{would have been enough, had \textit{Hymen} been} taking a jaunt
that way, to have frightened him out of the country; but when
\textit{Obadiah} accelerated this motion, and\break from a plain trot
assayed to prick his coach-horse into a full gallop\tsk by
hea-\break ven! Sir,\tsk the jingle was incredible.

As \textit{Obadiah} had a wife and three children\tsk The
turpitude of fornication, and the many other political ill
consequences of this jingling, never once entered his
brain,\tsk he had however his objection, which came home
to himself, and weigh\-ed with him, as it has oft-times done with\catch{the}
the greatest patriots.\tsk “\textit{The poor fel\-low, Sir, was
not able to hear himself whistle.}”

\null
\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  VIII.}

\dropcap[findent=1pt]{A}{s} \textit{Obadiah} loved wind musick pre\-ferably to all the instrumental
mu\-sick he carried with him,\tsk he very considerately set his imagination to work, to
contrive and to invent by what means he should put himself in a condition of
enjoying it.

\tight{In all distresses (except musical) where}
\stick{small cords are wanted,\tsk nothing is so}
\stck{apt to enter a man’s head, as his hat-band:}
\tsh the philosophy of this is so near the
surface\tsk I scorn to enter into it.

As \textit{Obadiah}’s was a mix’d case,\tsh mark,
Sirs,\tsh I say, a mix’d case; for it\catch{was} was
obstetrical,\tsk \textit{scrip}-tical,\tsk squirtical,
papistical,\tsk and as far as the coach-horse
\stick{was concerned in it,\tsk caball-istical\tsk and} only partly
musical;\tsk \textit{Obadiah} made no scruple of availing himself
of the first expedient which offered;\tsk so taking hold of the bag and
instruments, and gripeing them hard together with one hand, and with the finger and thumb
of the other, \tight{putting the end of the hat-band betwixt his} teeth, and
then slipping his hand down to the middle of it,\tsk he tied and
cross-tied them all fast together from one end to the other (as you
would cord a trunk) with such a multiplicity of round-abouts and
intricate cross turns, with a hard knot at every intersection or
point where the strings met,\tsk that Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} must have
had three fifths of \textit{Job}’s patience at least to have
unloosed them.\tsk I think in my
con-\break
science, that had \textsc{Nature} been in one of\catch{her}
her nimble moods, and in humour for
\stick{such a contest\tsh and she and Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}}
\stick{both fairly started together\tsk there is no}
\stick{man living who had seen the bag with all} that \textit{Obadiah} had done to
it,\tsk and known likewise, the great speed the goddess can
\stck{make when she thinks proper, who would} have had the least doubt
remaining in his mind\tsk which of the two would have carried off
the prize. My mother, madam, had been delivered sooner than the
green bag infallibly\tsh at least by twenty \textit{knots.}\tsh Sport
of small accidents, \textit{Trist\-ram Shandy!} that thou art, and ever
will be! had that trial been for thee, and it was fifty to one but
it had,\tsh thy affairs had not been so
depress’d\tsk
(at least by the depression of thy nose) as
they have been; nor had the fortunes of thy house and the occasions
of making them, which have so often presented themselves in
the\catch{course}
\stick{course of thy life, to thee, been so often,}
\stck{so vexatiously, so tamely, so irrecoverably}
abandoned\tsk as thou hast been forced
to leave them!\tsk but ’tis over,\tsk all
but the account of ’em, which cannot be given to the curious
till I am got out into the world.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  IX.}

\dropcap{G}{reat} wits jump: for the mo-\break ment Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} cast his eyes upon\break
his bag (which he
had not done till the dispute with my uncle \textit{Toby} about mid-wifery put him
in mind of it)\tsk the very same thought occurred.\tsh ’Tis God’s mercy, quoth he, (to
himself) that Mrs.\@ \textit{Shandy} has had so bad a time of it,\tsh else she might
have been brought to bed seven times told, before one half of these knots could have
got untied.\tsh But\catch{here,} here, you must distinguish\tsh the\break
thought floated only in Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}’s mind,\break
without sail or ballast to it, as a simple proposition;
millions of which, as your worship knows, are every day swiming\sic\ quietly in the
middle of the thin juice of a man’s understanding, without being carried backwards
or forwards, till some\break
\stick{little gusts of passion or interest drive} them to one side.

\tight{A sudden trampling in the room above,} \tight{near my mother’s
bed, did the proposition} the very service I am speaking of. By
all that’s unfortunate, quoth Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}, unless I make

the first place, I would not be under\-stood to mean slip-knots,\tsk because in the course of my life and
opinions,\tsh\break
my opinions concerning them will come in more properly when I mention the
catastrophe of my great uncle Mr.  \textit{Hammond Shandy},\tsk a little man,\tsk
but of\break
high fancy:\tsk he rushed into the duke of \textit{Monmouth}’s affair:\tsh nor,
secondly, in this place, do I mean that particular species of knots, called
bow-knots;\tsk there is so little address, or skill, or patience required in the
unloosing them, that they are below my giving any\break opinion at all about them.\tsk But
by the knots I am speaking of, may it please your reverences to believe, that I
mean\catch{good,}
good, honest, devilish tight, hard knots, made \textit{bona fide}, as
\textit{Obadiah} made his;\tsh in which there is no quibbling provision made by the
duplication and return of the two ends of the strings through the annulus or noose
made by the second\break\textit{implication} of them\tsk to get them slipp’d and
undone by\tsh\tsh I hope you ap-\break prehend me.

In the case of these \textit{knots} then, and of the several obstructions, which,
may it please your reverences, such knots cast in our way in getting through life\tsh
every hasty man can whip out his pen-knife and cut through them.\tsh ’Tis wrong.
Believe me, Sirs, the most virtuous way, and which both reason and conscience
dictate\tsk is to take our teeth or our fingers to them.\tsh Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} had lost his teeth\tsk
his favourite instrument,\catch{by} by extracting in a wrong direction, or by some
misapplication of it, unfortunately slipping, he had formerly, in a hard labour,
knock’d out three of the best of them with the handle of it:\tsh\break
he tried his fingers\tsk alas! the nails of his fingers and thumbs were cut
close.\tsk\break
The deuce take it! I
can make nothing of it either way, cried Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}.\tsh The trampling over head near my
mother’s bed side increased.\tsk Pox take the fellow! I shall never get the knots
untied as long as I live.\tsh My mother gave a groan.\tsk Lend me your penknife\tsk I
must e’en cut the knots at last - - - - - pugh! - - - psha!\break
- - - Lord!  I have cut my thumb quite
across to the very bone\tsh curse the fellow\tsk if there was not another man midwife
within fifty miles\tsk I am undone\break
for this bout\tsk I wish the scoundrel\break
hang’d\tsh I wish he was shot\tsh I wish\catch{all} 
all the devils in hell had him for a blockhead\tsh

My father had a great respect for \textit{Obadiah}, and could not
bear to hear him disposed of in such a manner\tsh he had moreover
some little respect for himself\tsh and could as ill bear with the indignity
offer’d to himself in it.

Had Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} cut any part about him, but his
thumb\tsh my father had pass’d it by\tsh his
prudence had triumphed: as it was, he was determined to have his
revenge.

Small curses, Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}, upon great occasions, quoth my
father (condoling with him first upon the accident) are but so much
waste of our strength and soul’s health to no manner of
purpose.\tsk I own\catch{it,}
it, replied Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}.\tsh They are like\break
sparrow-shot, quoth my uncle \textit{Toby} (suspending
his whistling) fired against a\break
bastion.\tsh They serve,
continued my father, to stir the humours\tsh but carry off
none of their acrimony:\tsk for my own part, I seldom swear or
curse at all\tsh\break I hold it bad\tsh but if I fall into it,
by surprize, I generally retain so much presence of mind (right,
quoth my uncle \textit{Toby}) as to make it answer my
purpose\tsh that is, I swear on, till I find myself easy.\break
A wife and a just man however would always endeavour to
proportion the vent given to these humours, not only to the
degree of them stirring within himself\tsk but to the size and
ill intent of the offence upon which they are to
fall.\tsh\break\lqq\textit{Injuries come only from the
heart},”\tsh\break
quoth my uncle \textit{Toby.} For this
reason, continued my father, with the most
\textit{Cer-}\catch{\textit{vantick}} \textit{vantick}
gravity, I have the greatest veneration in the world for that gentleman, who, in
distrust of his own discretion in this point, sat down and composed (that is at his
leisure) fit forms of swearing suitable to all cases, from the lowest to the highest
provocations which could possibly happen to him,\tsk which forms being well considered
by him, and such moreover as he could stand to, he kept them ever by him on the
chimney piece, within his reach, ready for use.\tsk I ne\-ver apprehended, replied
Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}, that such a thing was ever thought of,\tsh\break much less
executed. I beg your par-\break don\tsk answered my father; I was reading, though not using,
one of them to my brother \textit{Toby} this morning, whilst he pour’d out the
tea\tsk ’tis here upon the shelf over my head;\tsk but if I remem-\break

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XII.}

\dropcap{N}{ow} don’t let us give ourselves a\break
parcel of airs, and pretend that the oaths we make free with in
this land of liberty of ours are our own; and because we have the
spirit to swear them,\break\tsh imagine that we have had the wit
to invent them too.\patch{I’ll}

I’ll undertake this moment to prove it to any man in the
world, except to a connoisseur;\tsh though I declare I
object only to a connoisseur in swearing,\tsh as I would
do to a connoisseur in painting, \&c.\@ \&c.\@ the whole set of
’em are so hung round and \textit{befetish’d} with the
bobs and trinkets of criticism,\tsh or to drop my
metaphor, which by the bye is a pity,\break
\tsh for I have
fetch’d it as far as from the coast of
\textit{Guinea};\tsk their heads, Sir, are stuck so full of rules and compasses, and
have that eternal propensity to apply them upon all occasions, that
a work of genius had better go to the devil at once, than stand to
be prick’d and tortured to death by ’em.

\tsh And how did \textit{Garrick} speak the\break
\stck{soliloquy last night?\tsk Oh, against all rule,}\break
my Lord,\tsk most ungrammatically! be-\catch{twixt} twixt the substantive and the adjective, which
should agree together in \textit{number}, \textit{case}, and \textit{gender}, he
made a breach thus,\tsk stopping, as if the point wanted
settling;\break\tsh and betwixt the nominative case, which your
lordship knows should go\-vern the verb, he suspended his voice\break
in the epilogue a dozen times, three seconds and three fifths by a stop-watch,\break
\stick{my Lord, each time.\tsh Admirable}
\stick{grammarian!\tsh But in suspending}
\stick{his voice\tsh was the sense suspended}
\stck{likewise? Did no expression of attitude or}
\stick{countenance fill up the chasm?\tsh Was}
\stck{the eye silent? Did you narrowly look?\tsh}
\stick{I look’d only at the stop-watch, my Lord.}
\tsh Excellent observer!

And what of this new book the whole world makes such a rout
about?\tsk Oh! ’tis out of all plumb, my Lord,\tsh\break
quite an irregular thing!\tsk not one of\catch{the}
the angles at the four corners was a right angle.\tsk I had my rule
and compasses,
\stick{\&c.\@ my Lord, in my pocket.\tsh}\break
Excellent critic!

\tsh And for the epick poem, your\break
lordship bid me look at;\tsk upon tak-\break
ing the length, breadth, height, and\break
depth of it, and trying them at home\break
upon an exact scale of \textit{Bossu}’s,\tsh ’tis out,\break
my Lord, in every one of its dimensions.\break
\tsh Admirable connoisseur!

\tsh And did you step in, to take a look at the grand
picture in your way back.\tsk\break
\tsh ’Tis a melancholy daub! my Lord;\break
not one principle of the \textit{pyramid} in any one
group!\tsh and what a price!\tsh\break
for there is nothing of
the colouring of \textit{Titian},\tsk
the expression of \textit{Rubens},\tsk
the grace of \textit{Raphael},\tsk
the purity of\catch{\textit{Domi-}} 
\textit{Dominichino},\tsk
the \textit{corregiescity} of \textit{Corregio},\tsk
the learning of \textit{Poussin},\tsk
the airs of \textit{Guido},\tsk
the taste of the \textit{Carrachi}’s,\tsk\break or
the grand contour of \textit{Angelo}.\tsh\break
Grant me patience, just heaven!\tsh\break
Of all the cants which are canted in this canting world,\tsk though the cant of
hypocrites may be the worst,\tsh the cant of criticism is the most tormenting!

I would go fifty miles on foot, for I have not a horse worth
riding on, to kiss the hand of that man whose generous heart will
give up the reins of his imagination into his author’s
hands\tsh be pleased he knows not why, and cares not
wherefore.

Great \textit{Apollo!}\@ if thou art in a giving humour,\tsk give
me,\tsk I ask no more, but one stroke of native humour,
with\catch{a single}
a single spark of thy own fire along with it\tsh and send
\textit{Mercury}, with the \textit{rules and compasses}, if he can be
spared, with my compliments to\tsh no matter.

Now to any one else, I will undertake\break
to prove, that all the oaths and imprecations, 
which we have been puffing off upon 
the world for these two hundred and 
fifty years last past as originals,\tsh except
St.\@ \textit{Paul}’s \textit{thumb},\tsh \textit{God’s flesh\break
and God’s fish}, which were oaths monarchical, and, considering who made
them, not much amiss; and as kings
oaths, ’tis not much matter whether they
were fish or flesh;\tsh else, I say, there is not an oath, or at least a curse
amongst them, which has not been copied over\break and over again out of
\textit{Ernulphus}, a thousand times: but, like all other copies,
\stck{how infinitely short of the force and spirit}\catch{of}
of the original!\tsk It is thought to be no
bad oath,\tsh and by itself passes very
well\tsh \lqq\textit{G\kern 0.05pt
-\kern 0.05pt
-\kern 0.05pt
-\kern 0.05pt d damn you.}”\tsh Set it\break
beside \textit{Ernulphus}’s\tsh
\lqq God Almighty the Father damn you,\tsk
God the Son damn you,\tsk
God the Holy Ghost damn you,”\tsk
you see ’tis nothing.\tsk There
is an orientality in his, we cannot rise up
to: besides, he is more copious in his
invention\tsk possess’d more of the excellencies of a
swearer,\tsh had such a thorough knowledge of the human
frame, its membranes, nerves, ligaments, knittings of the joints,
and articulations,\tsk that when \textit{Ernulphus} cursed,\tsh no
part escaped him.\tsk ’Tis true, there is something of a
\textit{hardness} in his manner,\tsk and, as in \textit{Michael
Angelo}, a want of \textit{grace},\tsh but then there is such a
greatness of \textit{gusto!}\tsk

My father, who generally look’d upon\catch{every} every thing in a
light very different from all mankind,\tsh would, after all, never
allow this to be an original.\tsh He consider’d rather
\textit{Ernulphus}’s anathema, as an institute of swearing, in
which, as he suspected, upon the decline of \textit{swearing} in some
milder pontificate, \textit{Ernulphus}, by order of the succeeding
pope, had with great learning and diligence collected together all
the laws of it;\tsk for the same reason that \textit{Justinian}, in
the decline of the empire, had ordered his chancellor
\textit{Tribonian} to collect the \textit{Roman} or civil laws all
together into one code or digest,\tsh lest, through the
rust of time,\tsh and the fatality of all things committed
to oral tradition, they should be lost to the world for
ever.

For this reason my father would oft-times affirm, there was not
an oath, from\catch{the} the great and tremendous oath of \textit{William} the
Conqueror, (\textit{By the splendour of God}) down to the lowest oath of a
scavenger, (\textit{Damn your eyes}) which was not to be found in
\textit{Ernulphus.}\tsh In short, he would add,\tsk I defy a man
to swear \textit{out} of\break it.

The hypothesis is, like most of my father’s, singular and
ingenious too;\tsh nor have I any objection to it, but
that it overturns my own.

replied Dr.\@ \textit{Slop},\break (parodying my uncle \textit{Toby}’s hobby-horsi\-cal
reflection; though full as hobby-hor\-sically himself)\tsh do I know, Captain
\textit{Shandy}, what might have become of the garrison above stairs, in the mutiny
and confusion I find all things are in at pre\-sent, but for the subordination of
fingers and thumbs to \astvi\tsh the appli\-cation of which, Sir, under this accident
of mine, comes in so \textit{a propos}, that without it, the cut upon my thumb might
have been felt by the \textit{Shandy} family, as long as the \textit{Shandy} family

\dropcap{L}{et} us go back to the
\astvi\break\tsh in the last chapter.

It is a singular stroke of eloquence (at least it was so, when
eloquence flourished at \textit{Athens} and \textit{Rome}, and would be
so now, did orators wear mantles) not to mention the name of a
thing, when you had the thing about you, \textit{in petto}, ready to
produce, pop, in the place you want it. A scar, an axe, a sword, a
pink’d-\break doublet, a rusty helmet, a pound and a half of
pot-ashes in an urn, or a three-halfpenny pickle pot\tsk but
above all, a tender infant royally accoutred.\tsk Tho’ if
it was too young, and the oration as long as \textit{Tully}’s
second \textit{Philippick},\tsk it must certainly have beshit the
orator’s\catch{mantle.}
mantle.\tsk And then again, if too old,\break
\tsk it must have been unwieldly and in\-commodious to his action,\tsk so as
to make him lose by his child almost as much as he could
gain by it.\tsk Otherwise, when a state orator has hit the
precise age to a minute,\tsh hid his BAMBINO in his mantle
so cunningly that no mortal could smell it,\tsk and produced
it so critically, that no soul could say, it came in by head
and shoulders,\tsk Oh, Sirs!\@ it has done wonders.\tsh It
has open’d the sluices, and turn’d the brains, and shook the
principles, and unhinged the politicks of half a
nation.

\tight{These feats however are not to be done,} except in those states
and times, I say, where orators wore mantles,\tsk and pretty
large ones too, my brethren, with some twenty or five and twenty
yards of good\catch{purple,} purple, superfine, marketable cloth in\break
them,\tsh with large flowing folds and doubles, and in a
great stile of design.\break\tsh All which plainly shews,
may it please your worships, that the decay of eloquence,
and the little good service it does at present, both within,
and without doors, is owing to nothing else in the world,
but short coats, and the disuse of \textit{trunk-hose}.\tsh
We can conceal nothing under ours, Madam, worth shewing.

being an exception to all this argumentation: for happening to have
his green bays bag upon his knees, when he began to parody my
uncle \textit{Toby},\tsk ’twas as good as the best mantle in
the world to him: for which purpose, when he foresaw the sentence
would end in his new\catch{invented}
\tight{invented \textit{forceps}, he thrust his hand into
the}\break
bag in order to have them ready to clap in, where your reverences
took so much notice of the \astvi, which had he
managed,\tsk my uncle \textit{Toby} had cert\-ain\-ly been
overthrown: the sentence and the argument in that case jumping
closely in 
\stck{one point, so like the two lines which form}
\stick{the salient angle of a raveline,\tsk Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}}
\stick{would never have given them up;\tsh}
\stck{and my uncle \textit{Toby} would as soon thought}
of flying, as taking them by force: but\break Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} fumbled so vilely in
pulling them out, it took off the whole effect, and what was a ten
times worse evil (for they seldom come alone in this life) in
pulling out his \textit{forceps}, his \textit{forceps} unfortunately
drew out the \textit{squirt} along with it.

When a proposition can be taken in two senses,\tsh ’tis a
law in disputation That the respondent may reply to which\catch{of}
of the two he pleases, or finds most convenient for him.\tsh This
threw the advantage of the argument quite on my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s side.\tsk\lqq Good God!”
cried my uncle \textit{Toby}, \lqq\textit{are children brought into the

\dropcap{\Usk{16pt}U}{pon} my honour, Sir, you\break
have tore every bit of the skin\break
quite off the back of both my hands with your
forceps, cried my uncle \textit{Toby},\tsk\break
and you have crush’d all my knuckles into the bargain with them to a jelly. ’Tis your
own fault, said Dr.\@ \textit{Slop},\tsh you should have
clinch’d your two fists together into the form of a child’s head
as I told you, and sat firm.\tsh I did so, answered my uncle
\textit{Toby}.\tsh Then the points of my forceps have not been
suffi-\catch{ciently} ciently arm’d, or the rivet wants
closing\break\tsk or else
the cut on my thumb has made me a little aukward,\tsk or
possibly\tsk\break
’Tis well, quoth my father, interrupting the detail
of possibilities,\tsk that the ex\-periment was not first made upon
my child’s head piece. \tsh\, It would not\break have been a cherry stone
the worse, answered Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}. I maintain it, said
my uncle \textit{Toby}, it would have broke the ce\-rebellum,
(unless indeed the skull had been as hard as a granado) and
turned it all into a perfect posset. Pshaw! replied \stick{Dr.\@
\textit{Slop}, a child’s head is naturally as} soft as the pap of
an apple,;\tsh the su-\break tures give way,\tsk and besides, I could have
extracted by the feet after.\tsk Not you, said she.\tsk I rather
wish you would begin that way, quoth my father.

Pray do, added my uncle \textit{Toby}.\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

you take upon you to say, it may not be the child’s hip, as well
as the child’s head?\tsh ’Tis most certainly the head, replied
the midwife. Because, continued Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}, (turning to
my father) as positive as these old ladies generally are,\tsh
’tis a point very difficult to know,\tsk and yet of the greatest
consequence to be known;\tsh because, Sir, if the hip is
mistaken for the head,\tsk there is a possibility (if it is a
boy) that\break

\stick{\astfill.}

\tsh What the possibility was, Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}
whispered very low to my father, and then to my uncle
\textit{Toby}.\tsh There is no\catch{such}
such danger, continued he, with the head\break
\tsk No, in truth quoth my father\tsk but when
your possibility has taken place at the hip,\tsk you may as well
take off the head too.

\tsh It is morally impossible the reader should understand this,\tsh ’tis
enough\break 
\stick{Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} understood it;\tsh so taking the}
\stick{green bays bag in his hand, with the help}
\stick{of \textit{Obadiah}’s pumps, he tripp’d pretty}

and no more,\tsh cried my father, looking at his
watch, since Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} and\catch{\textit{Obadiah}}
\textit{Obadiah} arrived, \tsh and I know not how it happens,
brother \textit{Toby}, \tsh\break but to my imagination it seems
almost an age.

\tsh Here\tsh pray, Sir, take hold of my cap,\tsk nay, take the bell along with it, and my
pantoufles too.\tsh

Now, Sir, they are all at your service; and I freely make you a
present of ’em, on condition, you give me all your attention
to this chapter.

Though my father said, \lqq\textit{he knew not}\break
\lqq\textit{how it happen’d},\,”\tsk yet he knew very well how it happen’d;\tsh and
at the instant he spoke it, was pre-determined in his mind to
give my uncle \textit{Toby} a clear account of the matter by a
metaphysical dissertation upon the subject of
\textit{duration}\catch{\textit{and}}
\tight{\textit{and its simple modes}, in order to shew my}
\stck{uncle \textit{Toby}, by what mechanism and men-}
surations in the brain it came to pass,
that the rapid succession of their ideas, and the eternal
scampering of the discourse from one thing to another, since
Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} had come into the room, had lengthened out
so short a period to so inconceivable an extent.\tsk “\,I know not
how it happens,\break\tsk cried my father,\tsk\lqq but it
seems\break\lqq an age.”

\tsk ’Tis owing, entirely, quoth my uncle
\textit{Toby}, to the succession of our ideas.

My father, who had an itch in common with all philosophers, of
reasoning upon every thing which happened, and accounting for it
too,\tsk proposed infinite pleasure to himself in this, of the
succession of ideas, and had not the least appre-\catch{hension} hension of having
it snatch’d out of his hands by my uncle \textit{Toby}, who (honest man!)
generally took every thing as it happened;\tsh and who, of
all men in the world, troubled his brain the least with abstruse
thinking;\tsk the ideas of\break time and space,\tsk or how we came by
those ideas,\tsk or of what stuff they were made,\tsk or
whether they were born with us,\tsk or we pick’d them up
afterwards as we went along,\tsk or whether we did it
\stick{in frocks,\tsk or not till we had got into}
\stck{breeches,\tsk with a thousand other inquiries}
\stck{and disputes about \textsc{infinity}, \textsc{prescience},} 
\stick{\textsc{liberty}, \textsc{necessity}, and so forth, upon}
\stck{whose desperate and unconquerable theo-}
\stck{ries, so many fine heads have been turned}
and crack’d,\tsh never did my uncle \textit{Toby}’s the least injury
at all; my father knew it,\tsk and was no less surprised, than
he\catch{was} was disappointed with my uncle’s fortuitous solution.

Do you understand the theory of that affair? replied my
father.

Not I, quoth my uncle.

\tsh But you have some ideas, said my father, of what you talk
about\tsh

No more than my horse, replied my uncle \textit{Toby}.

Gracious heaven! cried my father, looking upwards, and clasping
his two hands together,\tsk there is a worth in thy honest
ignorance, brother \textit{Toby}\tsk ’twere almost a pity to
exchange it for a know\-ledge.\tsh But I’ll tell
thee.\tsh\patch{To}

To understand what \textit{time} is aright,\break
\stick{without which we never can comprehend}\break
\textit{infinity}, insomuch as one is a
portion of the other,\tsk we ought seriously to sit down and
consider what idea it is, we\break
\stick{have of \textit{duration}, so as to give a satisfacto-}\break
ry account, how we came by it.\tsk What is that
to any body? quoth my uncle \textit{Toby}.\break
\bgroup\itshape
\fnast\ For if you will turn your eyes inwards\break
upon your mind, {\upshape continued my father}, and\break
observe attentively, you will perceive, bro\-ther, 
that whilst you and I are talking together,
\tight{and thinking and smoaking our pipes}:\break
or whilst we receive successively ideas in our
minds, we know that we do exist, and so we
estimate the existence, or the continuation of
the existence of ourselves, or any thing else
commensurate to the succession of any ideas 
in our minds, the duration of ourselves, or 
any such other thing co existing with
our\egroup\break

\textit{thinking,\tsh and so
according to that preconceived}\tsh You puzzle me to death,
cried my uncle \textit{Toby}.\tsk


\tsk ’Tis owing to this, replied my fa-\break ther, that
in our computations of \textit{time}, we are so used to minutes, hours,
weeks, and months\tsh and of clocks (I wish there was not
a clock in the kingdom) to measure out their several portions to
us, and to those who belong to us,\tsh that ’twill be
well, if in time to come, the \textit{succession of our ideas} be of
any use or service to us at all.

Now, whether we observe it or no, \tight{continued my father, in every
sound man’s} head, there is a regular succession of\break ideas of
one sort or other, which follow each other in train just
like\tsh A train of artillery? said my uncle
\textit{Toby}.\tsk A train\catch{of} of a fiddle stick!\tsk quoth my
father,\tsk which follow and succeed one another in our minds at certain distances, just
like the images in the inside of a lanthorn turned round by the
heat of a candle.\tsk I declare, quoth my uncle \textit{Toby}, mine
are like a smoak-jack.\tsh Then, bro\-ther \textit{Toby},
I have nothing more to say to you upon that subject, said my
father.

a robbery of the \textit{Ontologic treasury}, of such a jewel, as no coalition of
great occasions and great men, are ever likely to restore to it again.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XX.}

\dropcap{T}{ho\lower2pt\hbox{’}} my father persisted in not going on
with the discourse\tsk yet he could not get my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s smoak-\catch{jack} jack out of his head,\tsk piqued as he was
at first with it;\tsk there was something in the comparison at
the bottom, which hit his fancy; for which purpose resting his
elbow upon the table, and reclining the right side of his head
upon the palm of his hand,\tsh but looking first stedfast\-ly in
the fire,\tsh he began to commune with himself, and philosophize
about it: but his spirits being wore out with the fatigues of

\dropcap{N}{o}, I’ll not say a word about it\tsk\break
here it is;\tsk in publishing it\tsk\break
I have appealed to the world,\tsh and to the world I leave
it;\tsk it must speak for itself.

All I know of the matter is,\tsk when I sat down, my intent was
to write a good book; and as far as the tenuity of my understanding
would hold out,\tsk a wise, aye, and a discreet,\tsk taking care
only, as I went along, to put into it all the wit and the judgment
(be it more or less) which the great author and bestower of them
had thought fit originally to give\catch{me,}
me,\tsh so that, as your
worships see,\tsk ’tis just as God pleases.

Now, \textit{Agalastes}\sic\ (speaking dispraising\-ly)
sayeth, That there may be some wit in it, for aught he
knows,\tsk
but no judg-\break ment at all. And \textit{Triptolemus} and \textit{Phutatorius}
agreeing thereto, ask, How is it possible there should?
for that wit and
\stick{judgment in this world never go toge-}
ther;  inasmuch as they are two operations differing
from each other as wide as east is from west.\tsk So, says
\textit{Locke},\tsk so are farting and hickuping, say I. But
in answer to this, \textit{Didius} the great church \stick{lawyer, in his
code \smallit{de fartandi et illustrandi}}\break\smallit{fallaciis}, doth maintain and
make fully appear, That an illustration is no
argument,\tsk nor do I maintain the wiping of\break a
looking-glass clean, to be a syllogism;\break\tsk but you all, may it
please your wor-\catch{ships,} ships, see the better for it,\tsh so that
the main good these things do, is only to clarify the understanding,
previous to the application of the argument itself, in order to
free it from any little motes, or specks of opacular matter, which
if left swimming therein, might hinder a conception and spoil
all.

Now, my dear Anti-Shandeans, and\break
thrice able critics, and
fellow-labourers (for to you I write this Preface)\tsh and
to you, most subtle statesmen and discreet doctors (do\tsk pull
off your beards) renowned for gravity and
wisdom;\tsh \textit{Monopolos}, my
politician,\tsk \textit{Didius}, my counsel; \textit{Kysarcius}, my
friend;\tsk \smallit{Phutato\-rius}, my
guide;\tsk \smallit{Gastripheres}, the preserv\-er of my life;
\textit{Somnolentius}, the balm and repose of it,\tsk not
forgetting all others as well sleeping as waking,\tsk ecclesiastical
as civil, whom for brevity, but out of no\catch{resent-}
resentment to you, I lump all together.\break
\tsh Believe me, right worthy,

My most zealous wish and fervent\break
prayer in your behalf, and in my own\break
too, in case the thing is not done already\break
for us,\tsh is, that the great gifts and endowments both of wit
and judgment, with every thing which usually goes al\-ong with
them,\tsh such as memory, fan\-cy, genius, eloquence, quick
parts, and what not, may this precious moment,\break without stint or
measure, let or hinderance, be poured down warm as each of us could
bear it,\tsk scum and sediment an’\break
\stick{all; (for I would not have a drop lost)}
\stck{into these veral receptacles, cells, cellules,}
domiciles, dormitories, refectories, and spare places of our
brains,\tsh in such sort, that they might continue to be
injected and tunn’d into, according to the true\catch{intent} intent
and meaning of my wish, until\break
every vessel of them, both great and\break
small, be so replenished, saturated and\break
fill’d up therewith, that no more, would it save a man’s life, could possibly be
got either in or out.

\tight{Bless us!\tsk what noble work we should}
make!\tsh how should I tickle it off!\break
\tsh and what spirits should I find
myself in, to be writing away for such readers!\break
\tsk and you,\tsk just heaven!\tsk\  with what\break raptures would you
sit and read,\tsk but oh!\tsk ’tis too much,\tsh I
am sick,\tsh I~faint away deliciously at the thoughts of
it!\tsk ’tis more than nature can bear!\break
\tsk lay hold of
me,\tsh I am giddy,\tsk I am stone blind,\tsk I’m
dying,\tsk I am gone.\tsh Help! Help! Help!\tsh But
hold,\tsk I grow something better again, for I am beginning to
foresee, when this is over, that as we shall all of us conti-\catch{nue}
nue to
be great wits,\tsk we should never agree amongst ourselves, one
day to an end:\tsh there would be so much satire and
sarcasm,\tsh scoffing and flouting, with raillying and
reparteeing of it,\tsk thrusting
and parrying in one corner or another,\tsh there would be
nothing but mischief among us,\tsk Chaste stars! what
biting and scratching, and what a racket and a clatter we should
make, what with breaking of heads, rapping of knuckles, and hitting
of sore places,\tsk there would be no such thing as living for
us.

But then again, as we should all of us be men of great judgment,
we should make up matters as fast as ever they went wrong; and
though we should abominate each other, ten times worse than so many
devils or devilesses, we should nevertheless, my dear creatures, be
all courtesy\catch{and} and kindness,\tsh milk and honey,\tsh ’twould be a
second land of promise,\tsh\break
a paradise upon earth, if there was
such a thing to be had,\tsk so that upon the whole we should have
done well enough.

All I fret and fume at, and what most 
\stck{distresses my invention at present, is how}
to bring the point itself to bear; for as your
worships well know, that of these 
\stck{heavenly emanations of \textit{wit} and \textit{judgment},} 
which I have so bountifully wished both for your
worships and myself,\tsk there is but a certain \textit{quantum}
stored up for us all, for the use and behoof of the whole race of
mankind; and such small \textit{modicums} of ’em are only sent forth
into this wide world, circulating here and there in one by corner
or another,\tsk and in such narrow streams, and at such prodigious
intervals from each other, that one would\catch{wonder} wonder how it holds out,
or could be sufficient for the wants and emergencies of so many
great estates, and populous empires.

Indeed there is one thing to be considered, that in \textit{Nova
Zembla}, \textit{North Lap-}\break
\textit{land}, and in all those cold and dreary tracts
of the globe, which lie more directly under the arctick and
antartick circles,\tsh where the whole province of a man’s
concernments lies for near nine months together, within the narrow
compass of his cave,\tsk where the spirits are compressed almost
to nothing,\tsk and 
\stick{\tight{where the passions of a man, with every}} 
thing which belongs to them, are as frigid as the zone
itself;\tsk there the least \tight{quantity of \textit{judgment} imaginable
does the business},\tsh and of \textit{wit},\tsh there
is a total and an absolute saving,\tsk for as not one spark\catch{is}
is wanted,\tsk so not one spark is given. Angels and ministers of
grace defend us!\break
\tight{What a dismal thing would it have been to}
have governed a kingdom, to have fought a battle, or made a treaty, or
run a match, \stick{or wrote a book, or got a child, or held a} provincial
chapter there, with so \textit{plenti\-ful a lack} of wit and judgment
about~us!\@ for mercy’s sake!\@ let us think no more about it,
but travel on as fast as we can southwards into
\textit{Norway},\tsk crossing over
\stick{\textit{Swedeland}, if you please, through the}
small triangular province of \textit{Angermania} to the
lake of \textit{Bothnia}; coasting along it through east and west
\textit{Bothnia}, down to\break 
\stck{\textit{Carelia}, and so on, through all those states}
and provinces which border upon the far side of the
\textit{Gulf} of \textit{Finland}, and the north-east of the
\textit{Baltick}, up to \textit{Petersbourg}, and just stepping into
\textit{Ingria};\tsh then\break stretching over directly from
thence\catch{through}
through the north parts of the \textit{Russian} empire,\tsk
leaving \textit{Siberia} a little upon the left hand, till we
got into the very heart of \textit{Russian} and \textit{Asiatick
Tartary.}

Now through this long tour which\break
I have led you, you observe the
good people are better off by far, than in the polar countries
which we have just left:\break\tsk for if you hold your hand over your
eyes, and look very attentively, your may perceive some small
glimmerings (as it were) of wit, with a comfortable provision of
good plain \textit{houshold} judgment, which, taking the quality and
quantity of it together, they make a very good shift
with,\tsk and had they more of either the one or the other,
it would destroy the proper ballance betwixt them, and I am
satisfied moreover they would want occasions to put them to
use.\patch{Now,}

Now, Sir, if I conduct you home again into this warmer and more
luxuriant island, where you perceive the spring tide of our blood
and humours runs high,\tsh where we have more ambition, and
pride, and envy, and lechery, and other whoreson passions upon our
hands to govern and subject to reason,\tsk the
\textit{height} of our wit and the \textit{depth} of our judgment, you
see, are exactly proportioned to the 
\stck{\textit{length} and \textit{breadth} of our necessities,\tsk and}
accordingly, we
have them sent down amongst us in such a flowing kind of decent and
creditable plenty, that no one thinks he has any cause to
complain.

It must however be confessed on this head, that, as our air
blows hot and cold,\break\tsh wet and dry, ten times in a day, we have
them in no regular and settled way;\break\tsh so that sometimes for
near half a\catch{century} century together, there shall be very little wit or
judgment either to be seen or heard of amongst us:\tsk the
small channels of them shall seem quite dried up,\tsk\break 
\stck{then all of a sudden the sluices shall break}
out, and take a fit of running again like fury,\tsh you would think they would
never stop:\tsh and then it is, that in writing and fighting, and twenty other
gallant things, we drive all the world before us.

It is by these observations, and a wary reasoning by analogy in
that kind of argumentative process, which \textit{Suidas} calls
\textit{dialectick induction},\tsk that I draw and set up
this position as most true and veri\-table.

That of these two luminaries, so much of their irradiations are
suffered from\catch{time}
\stick{time to time to shine down upon us; as}
\stick{\tighter{he, whose infinite wisdom which dispenses}}
every thing in exact weight and
measure, knows will just serve to light us on our way in this night
of our obscurity; so that your reverences and worships now find
out, nor is it a moment longer in my power to conceal it from you,
That the fervent wish in your behalf with which I set out, was no
more than the first insinuating \textit{How d’ye} of a
caressing prefacer stifling his reader, as a lover sometimes does
a coy mistress into silence. For alas! could this effusion of
light have been as easily procured, as the exordium wished it\tsk I tremble to think how many
thousands for it, of benighted travellers (in the learned sciences
at least) must have groped and blundered on in the dark, all the
nights of their lives,\tsh running their heads against
posts, and knocking out\catch{their}
their brains without ever getting to their
journies end;\tsk some falling with their 
\tight{noses
perpendicularly into stinks,\tsk others} horizontally with
their tails into kennels.\break
\stick{Here one half of a learned profession tilt-}
ing full butt against the other half of it, and then tumbling
and rolling one over the other in the dirt like hogs.\tsk Here
the brethren, of another profession, who should have run in
opposition to each other, flying on the contrary like a flock of
wild geese, all in a row the same way.\break
\tsk What confusion!\tsk what mistakes!\break
\tsh fiddlers and painters judging by their eyes and ears,\tsk
admirable!\tsk trusting to the passions excited in an air

soul touch upon the subject,\tsh with such weak nerves and spirits, and in the
condition I am in at present, ’twould be as much as my life \stick{was worth, to deject and
contrist my-} self with so sad and melancholy an account,\tsk and therefore ’tis
safer to draw a curtain across, and hasten from it, as fast as I can, to the main
and principal point I have undertaken to clear up,\tsh and that is, How it comes to
pass, that your men of least \textit{wit} are reported to be men of most
\textit{judgment}.\tsh But mark,\tsk\catch{I say,}
I say, \textit{reported to be}\tsk for it is no more, my dear
Sirs, than a report, and which,\break
like twenty others taken up every\break
day upon trust, I maintain to be a vile\break
and a malicious report into the bar-\break gain.

This by the help of the observations al-\break
\tight{ready premised, and I hope already weigh-}\break
\tight{ed and perpended by your reverences and}\break
worships, I shall forthwith make ap-\break pear.

I hate set dessertations,\tsh and above all things in
the world, ’tis one of the silliest things in one of them, to
darken your hypothesis by placing a number of tall, opake words,
one before another, in a right line, betwixt your own and your
reader’s conception,\tsh when in all likelihood, if you had
looked about you,\catch{might} might have seen something standing, or hanging
up, which would have cleared the point at
once\tsk \lqq for what hinde-\break
\lqq rance, hurt or harm, doth the laudable\break
\lqq desire of knowledge bring to any man,\break
\lqq if even from a sot, a pot, a fool, a stool, a\break
\lqq winter-mittain, a truckle for a pully,\break
\lqq the lid of a goldsmith’s crucible, an oyl\break
\lqq bottle, an old slipper, or a cane chair,”\break
\tsk I am this moment sitting upon one. Will you give me leave
to illustrate this affair of wit and judgment, by the two knobs
on the top of the back of it,\tsh\break they are fasten’d on,
you see, with two pegs stuck slightly into two gimlet-holes, and
will place what I have to say in so clear a light, as to let you
see through the drift and meaning of my whole preface, as
plainly as if every point and particle of it was made up of sun
beams.\patch{I enter}

I enter now directly upon the point.

\tsh Here stands \textit{wit},\tsh and there stands
\textit{judgment}, close beside it, just like the two knobbs I’m
speaking of, upon the back of this self-same chair on which I am
sitting.

\tsk You see, they are the highest and most ornamental parts of
its \textit{frame},\tsk as wit and judgment are of
\textit{ours},\tsk and like them too, indubitably both made and
fitted to go together, in order, as we say in all such cases of
duplicated embellishments,\tsh \textit{to answer one another}.

\noindent\stick{\hfill Now for the sake of an experiment, and}
\stick{for the clearer illustrating this matter,\tsk} let us for
a moment, take off one of these two curious ornaments (I care
not which) from the point or pinnacle of the chair it\catch{now}
now stands on;\tsh nay, don’t laugh at it.\tsk But did you ever
see in the whole course of your lives, such a ridiculous
business as this has made of it?\tsk Why, ’tis as miserable a
sight as a sow with one ear; and there is just as much sense and
symmetry in the one, as in the other:\tsk do,\tsk pray, get off
your seats, only to take a view of it.\tsh Now would any man who
valued his character a straw, have turned a piece of work out of
his hand in such a condition?\tsk nay, lay \stck{your hands
upon your hearts, and answer} this plain question, Whether this
one single knobb, which now stands here like a blockhead by
itself, can serve any purpose upon earth, but to put one in mind
of the want of the other;\tsh and let me further ask, in case
the chair was your own, if you would not in your consci\-ences
think, rather than be as it is, that\catch{it} it would be ten
times better without any knobb at all.

Now these two knobs\tsh or top ornaments of the mind of man,
which crown the whole entablature,\tsk being, as I said, wit and
judgment, which of all others, as I have proved it, are the most
needful,\tsh the most priz’d,\tsh the most calamitous to be
without, and consequently the hardest to come at,\tsk for all
these reasons put together, there is not a mortal amongst us, so
destitute of a love of good fame or feeding,\tsh or so ignorant
of what will do him good therein,\tsk who does not wish and
stedfastly resolve in his own mind, to be, or to be thought at
least master of the one or the other, and indeed of both of
them, if the thing seems any way feasible, or likely to be\break
brought to pass.\patch{Now}

Now your graver gentry having little or no kind of chance in
aiming at the one,\tsk unless they laid hold of the
other,\tsh pray what do you think would become of
them?\tsk Why, Sirs, in spight of all their
\textit{gravities}, they must e’en have been contented to have
gone with their insides naked:\tsk this was not to be
borne, but by an effort of philosophy not to be supposed in the
case we are upon,\tsh so that no one could well have been
angry with them, had they been satisfied with what little they
could have snatched up and secreted under their cloaks and great
perrywigs, had they not raised a \textit{hue} and \textit{cry} at the
same time against the lawful owners.

I need not tell your worships, that this was done with so much
cunning and artifice,\tsk that the great \textit{Locke},
who was sel-\catch{dom} dom outwitted by false
sounds,\tsk was nevertheless bubbled here. The cry, it
seems, was so deep and solemn a one, and what with the help of
great wigs, grave faces, and other implements of deceit,
\tight{was rendered so general a one against} the \textit{poor wits} in this
matter, that the phi\-losopher himself was deceived by it,\tsk it
was his glory to free the world from the lumber of a thousand
vulgar errors;\tsh but this was not of the number; so that
instead of sitting down cooly, as such a philosopher should have
done, to have examined the matter of fact before he philosophised
upon it;\tsk on the contra\-ry he took the fact for granted, and so
joined in with the cry, and halloo’d it as boisterously as
the rest.

This has been made the \textit{Magna Charta} of stupidity ever
since,\tsh but your reve-\catch{rences} rences plainly see, it has been
obtained in such a manner, that the title to it is not worth a
groat; \tsh which by the bye is one of the many and vile
impositions which gravity and grave folks have to an\-swer for
hereafter.

As for great wigs, upon which I may be thought to have spoken my
mind too freely,\tsh I beg leave to qualify whatever has
been unguardedly said to their dispraise or prejudice, by one
general declaration\tsk That I have no abhorrence whatever,
nor do I detest and abjure either great wigs or long beards,\tsk any
further than when I see they are bespoke and let \tight{grow on purpose to
carry on this self-same} imposture\tsk for any
purpose,\tsk peace be with them;\tsk ☞ mark
only,\tsk I write not for them.\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXII.}

\dropcap{W}{hen} corporal \textit{Trim} had brought
his two mortars to bear, he was delighted with his handy-work
above\break
measure; and knowing what a pleasure it would be to his master to
see them, he was not able to resist the desire he had of carrying
them directly into his parlour.

Now next to the moral lesson I had in view in mentioning the
affair of \textit{hinges}, I had a speculative consideration arising
out of it, and it is this.

Had the parlour-door open’d and\break
turn’d upon its hinges, as a door should do\tsh\patch{\tsk Or}

\tsk Or for example, as cleverly as our government has been
turning upon its hinges,\tsh (that is, in case things have all
along gone well with your worship,\tsk otherwise I give up my
simile)\tsk in this case, I say, there had been no danger either
to master or man, in corporal \textit{Trim}’s peeping in: the
moment, he had beheld my father and my uncle \textit{Toby} fast
asleep,\break\tsk the respectfulness of his carriage was such,
he would have retired as silent as death, and left them both in
their arm-chairs, dreaming as happy as he had\break found them:
but the thing was, morally speaking so very impracticable, that
for the many years in which this hinge was suffered to be out of
order, and amongst the hourly grievances my father submitted to
upon its account,\tsk this was one; that he never folded his
arms to take his nap after dinner, but the thoughts of be-\catch{ing}
ing unavoidably awakened by the first person who should open the
door, was always uppermost in his imagination, and so
incessantly step’d in betwixt him and the first balmy presage
of his repose, as to rob him, as he often declared, of the whole
sweets of it.

\indent
\lqq\textit{When things move upon bad hinges}, an’ please your lordships, \textit{how can
it be otherwise?}

\noindent
\stick{\hfill Pray what’s the matter? Who is there?}
cried my father, waking, the moment\break the door began to creak.\tsh I wish the
\stck{smith would give a peep at that confound-}
ed hinge.\tsh ’Tis nothing, an’ please your honour, said
\textit{Trim}, but two mortars I am bringing in.\tsh They
shan’t make a clatter with them here, cried my father
hastily.\tsh If Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} has any\catch{drugs}
drugs to pound, let him do it in the\break
kitchen.\tsk May it please
your honour, cried \textit{Trim},\tsk they are two mortar-pieces for
a siege next summer, which I have been making out of a pair of
jack-boots, which \textit{Obadiah} told me your honour had left
off wearing.\tsk By heaven!\@ cried my father, springing out of
his chair, as\break
\stick{he swore,\tsk I have not one appointment} belonging
to me, which I set so much store by, as I do by these
jack-boots,\break\tsh they were our great-grandfather’s, brother
\textit{Toby},\tsk they were \textit{hereditary}.\break
Then I fear, quoth my uncle \textit{Toby}, \textit{Trim}
\stick{has cut off the entail.\tsk I have only cut}
off the tops, an’ please your honour,\break
cried \textit{Trim}.\tsh I hate \textit{perpetuities} as much\break
as any man alive, cried my father,\break
\tsh but these jack-boots, continued he, (smiling,
though very angry at the same time) have been in the family,
brother,\catch{ever} ever since the civil wars;\tsk Sir \textit{Roger
Sha\-ndy} wore them at the battle of \textit{Marston-Moor}.\tsk I
declare I would not have taken ten pounds for them.\tsh I’ll pay

\textit{Toby}, looking at the two mortars with infinite
pleasure, and putting his hand in-\break
\tight{to his breeches-pocket as he viewed them.}\break
\tsh I’ll pay you the ten pounds this moment with all
my heart and soul.\tsh

Brother \textit{Toby}, replied my father, altering his tone, you
care not what money you dissipate and throw away, provided,
continued he, ’tis but upon a
\ls{\textsc{siege}}.\tsh Have I not a hundred and
twenty pounds a year, besides my half-pay? cried my uncle
\textit{Toby}.\tsh What is that, replied my father,
hastily,\tsk to ten pounds for a pair of jack-boots?\tsh twelve
guineas for your \textit{pontoons};\tsk half as much
for\catch{your}
\stck{your \textit{Dutch}-draw-bridge;\tsk to say nothing}
\stick{\tight{of the train of little brass-artillery you be-}}
\stck{spoke last week, with twenty other prepa-}
\stick{\tight{rations for the siege of \smallit{Messina}; believe me,}}
\stick{dear brother \textit{Toby}, continued my father,}
\stck{taking him kindly by the hand,\tsk these mi-}
\stick{litary operations of yours are above your}
\stick{strength;\tsk you mean well, brother,\tsk but}
\stck{they carry you into greater expences than}

\stick{beggar of you.\tsk What signifies it if}
\stick{they do, brother, replied my uncle \textit{Toby},}
\stick{so long as we know ’tis for the good of}
the nation.\tsk

My father could not help smiling for his soul;\tsk his anger at
the worst was ne\-ver more than a spark,\tsk and the zeal and
simplicity of \textit{Trim},\tsh and the generous\catch{(tho’}
(tho’ hobby-horsical) gallantry of my\break 
\stck{uncle \textit{Toby}, brought him into perfect good}
humour with them in an instant.

Generous souls!\tsk God prosper you both, and your mortar-pieces

\dropcap{A}{ll} is quiet and hush, cried my\break
father, at least above stairs,\tsk I\break
hear not one foot stirring.\tsh Prithee, \textit{Trim}, who is in
the kitchen?  There is no one soul in the kitchen, answered
\textit{Trim}, making a low bow as he spoke, except
\stick{Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}.\tsk Confusion! cried my father,}
\stick{(getting up upon his legs a second time)}
\stick{\tsk\tsk not one single thing has gone right}
this day! had I faith in astrology, bro\-ther, (which by
the bye, my father had)\catch{I would}
I would have sworn some retrograde pla\-net was hanging over this
unfortunate house of mine, and turning every individual thing in
it out of its place.\tsh\break
Why, I thought Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} had been above stairs with my
wife, and so said you.\tsh\break
What can the fellow be puzzling about
in the kitchen?\tsk He is busy, an’ please your honour, replied
\textit{Trim}, in making a bridge.\tsh ’Tis very obliging in
him, quoth my uncle \textit{Toby};\tsh pray, give my humble
service to Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}, \textit{Trim}, and tell him I
thank him heartily.

You must know, my uncle \textit{Toby} mistook the bridge as
widely as my father mistook the mortars;\tsh but to
under\-stand how my uncle \textit{Toby} could mistake the
bridge,\tsk I fear I must give you an\break exact account of the road
which led to it;\tsk or to drop my metaphor (for\catch{there}
there is nothing more dishonest in an historian, than the use of
one,)\tsh in order to conceive the probability of this error in
my uncle \textit{Toby} aright, I must give you some account of
an adventure of \textit{Trim}’s, though much against my will. I
say much against my will, only because the story, in one sense,
is certainly out of its place here; for by right it should come
in, either amongst the anecdotes of my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
amours with widow \textit{Wadman}, in which corporal
\textit{Trim} was no mean actor,\tsk or else in the middle of his

will you do one thing?

I beg and beseech you, (in case you\catch{will}
will do nothing better for us) that wherever in any part of your
dominions it so falls out, that three several roads meet in one
point, as they have done just here,\tsk that at least you set up
a guide-post, in the center of them, in mere charity to direct
an uncertain devil, which of the three he is to take.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXIV.}

\dropcap{T}{ho}’ the shock my uncle \textit{Toby} re-\break
ceived the year after the demoli-\break
tion of \textit{Dunkirk}, in his affair with widow \textit{Wadman}, had fixed
him in a resolution never more to think of the sex,\tsk or of
aught which belonged to it;\tsk yet corporal \textit{Trim} had made
no such bargain with himself. Indeed in my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s case there was a strange and unaccountable
concurrence of circumstances, which in-\catch{sensibly} sensibly drew him in, to lay
siege to that fair and strong citadel.\tsh In
\textit{Trim}’s case there was a concurrence of nothing in the
world, but of him and \textit{Bridget} in the kitchen;\tsk though
in truth, the love and veneration he bore his master was such, and
so fond was he of imitating him in all he did, that had my uncle \textit{Toby}
employed his time and genius in tagging of points,\tsh I am
persuaded the honest corporal would laid\sic\ down his arms, and
followed his example with pleasure. When therefore my uncle
\textit{Toby} sat down before the mistress,\tsk corporal \textit{Trim}
incontinently took ground before the maid.

Now, my dear friend \textit{Garrick}, whom I have so much cause to
esteem and honour,\tsk (why, or wherefore, ’tis no
matter)\tsk can it escape your penetration,\tsk I defy
it,\tsk that so many play-wrights, and\catch{opificers}
opificers of chit chat have
ever since been 
\stck{working upon \textit{Trim}’s and my uncle \textit{Toby}’s}
pattern.\tsh I care not what
\textit{Aristotle}, or \textit{Pacuvius}, or \textit{Bossu}, or
\textit{Ricaboni} say,\tsk (though I never read one of
them)\tsh there is not a greater difference between a
single-horse chair and madam \textit{Pompa\-dour}’s
\textit{vis} a \textit{vis}, than betwixt a single amour, and an amour thus
nobly doubled, and going upon all four, prancing throughout a grand
drama,\tsk Sir, a simple, single, silly affair of that kind,\tsh is
quite lost in five acts,\tsh but that is neither here nor
there.

After a series of attacks and repulses in a course of nine
months on my uncle \textit{Toby}’s quarter, a most minute
account of every particular of which shall be given in its
proper place, my uncle \textit{Toby}, honest man! found it
necessary to draw off\catch{his} his forces and raise the siege somewhat
indignantly.


Corporal \textit{Trim}, as I said, had made no such bargain either with
himself\tsh or with any one else,\tsh the fidelity however of
his heart not suffering him to go into a house which his master had forsaken
with disgust,\tsh he contented himself with turning his part of the
siege into a blockade;\tsk that is, he kept others off,\tsk for though he
never after went to the house, yet he never met \textit{Bridget} in the village,
but he would either nod or wink, or smile, or look kindly at
her,\tsk or (as
circumstances directed), he would shake her by the hand,\tsk or ask her
lovingly how she did,\tsk or would give her a ribban,\tsk and now and then,
though never but when it could be done with decorum, would give \textit{Bridget}
a \tsh\patch{Pre-}

Precisely in this situation, did these things stand for five
years; that is from the demolition of \textit{Dunkirk} in the
year 13, to the latter end of my uncle \textit{Toby}’s campaign
in the year 18, \tight{which was about six or seven weeks before the
time I’m speaking of}.\tsk When \textit{Trim}, as his custom was,
after he had put my uncle \textit{Toby} to bed, going down one
moon-shiny night to see that every thing was right at his
fortifications,\tsh in the lane separated from the bowling-green
with flowering shrubs and holly,\tsk he espied his
\textit{Bridget}.

As the corporal thought there was no\-thing in the world so well
worth shewing as the glorious works which he and my uncle
\textit{Toby} had made, \textit{Trim} courteous\-ly and gallantly took
her by the hand, and led her in: this was not done so private\-ly,
but that the foul-mouth’d trumpet of\catch{Fame}
Fame carried it from ear to ear, till at length it reached my
father’s, with this untoward circumstance along with it,\break
\stck{that my uncle \textit{Toby}’s curious draw-bridge,} constructed and
painted after the \textit{Dutch} fashion, and which went quite
across the ditch,\tsk was broke down, and some how or other
crush’d all to pieces that very night.

My father, as you have observed, had no great esteem for my
uncle \textit{Toby}’s\break hobby-horse,\tsk he thought it the most
ri\-diculous horse that ever gentleman mou\-nt\-ed; and indeed unless my
uncle \textit{Toby} vexed him about it, could never think of it once,
without smiling at it,\tsh so that it could never get lame
or happen any mischance, but it tickled my father’s
imagination beyond measure; but this being an accident much more to
his hu-\catch{mour} mour than any one which had yet befall’n it, it proved
an inexhaustible fund of entertainment to
him,\tsh Well,\tsh but dear \textit{Toby!} my father
would say, do tell us seriously how this affair of the bridge
happened.\tsh How can you teaze me so much about it? my uncle
\textit{Toby} would reply,\tsk I have told it you twenty times,
word for word as \textit{Trim} told it me.\tsk Pri\-thee, how was
it then, corporal? my father would cry, turning to
\textit{Trim.}\tsk It was a mere misfortune, an’ please your
honour;\tsk I was shewing Mrs.\@ \textit{Bridget}\break our
fortifications, and in going too near the edge of the fossè, I
unfortunately\break slip’d in.\tsk Very well, \textit{Trim!}\@ my
father would cry,\tsh (smiling mysteriously, and\break
giving a nod,\tsh but without inter-\break
rupting him)\tsh and being link’d\break
fast, an’ please your honour, arm in arm with Mrs.\@
\textit{Bridget}, I dragg’d her after\catch{me,} 
\stck{me, by means of which she fell backwards}
soss against the bridge,\tsh and \textit{Trim}’s
foot (my uncle \textit{Toby} would cry, taking the story out of
his mouth) getting into the cuvette, he tumbled full against the
bridge too.\tsk It was a thousand to one, my uncle \textit{Toby}
would add, that the poor 
\stick{fellow did not break his leg.\tsh Ay truly!}
my father would say,\tsh a limb is soon broke, brother
\textit{Toby}, in such encounters.\break
\tsh And so, an’ please your honour, the bridge, which your
honour knows was a very slight one, was broke down betwixt us,
and splintered all to pieces.

At other times, but especially when my uncle \textit{Toby} was so
unfortunate as to say a syllable about cannons, bombs, or
petards,\tsk my father would exhaust all the stores of his
eloquence (which indeed were very great) in a panegyric upon
the\catch{\textsc{bat-}}
\textsc{battering-rams} of the ancients,\tsk the 
\stck{\textsc{vinea} which \textit{Alexander} made use of at the}
\stick{siege of \textit{Tyre}.\tsk He would tell my uncle}
\stick{\textit{Toby} of the \textsc{catapultæ} of the \textit{Syrians}}
\stick{\tighter{which threw such monstrous stones so ma-}}
\stick{ny hundred feet, and shook the strongest}
\stick{\tight{bulwarks from their very foundation;\tsk he}}
would go on and
describe the wonderful mechanism of the \textsc{ballista} which
\textit{Mar\-cellinus} makes so much rout about,\tsk the terrible
effects of the \textsc{pyraboli},\tsk which cast fire;\tsk the
danger of the \textsc{terebra} and \textsc{scorpio}, which cast
javelins.\tsh But what are these, would he say, to the
destructive machinery of corporal \textit{Trim}?\tsk
Believe me, brother \textit{Toby}, no bridge, or bastion, or
sally port that ever was constructed in this world, can hold
out against
such artillery.

My uncle \textit{Toby} would never attempt\catch{any}
any defence against the force of this ridi\-cule, but that of
redoubling the vehemence of smoaking his pipe; in doing which,
he raised so dense a vapour one night after supper, that it set
my father, who was a little phthisical, into a suffocating fit
of violent coughing: my uncle \textit{Toby} leap’d up without
feeling the pain upon his groin,\tsk and, with infinite pity,

\dropcap{T}{he} draw-bridge being held
irrepa\-rable, \textit{Trim} was ordered directly to set about
another,\tsh but not upon the same model; for cardinal
\textit{Alberoni}’s intrigues at that time being discovered,
and my uncle \textit{Toby} rightly foreseeing that a flame would
inevitably break out betwixt \textit{Spain} and the Empire, and that
the operations of the ensuing campaign must in all likelihood be
either in \textit{Naples} or \textit{Sicily},\tsh he determined
upon an \textit{Italian}\break bridge,\tsk (my uncle \textit{Toby},
by the bye, was not far out of his conjectures)\tsh\break
but my father, who was infinitely the better politician, and
took the lead as far of my uncle \textit{Toby} in the cabinet,
as my\catch{uncle} uncle \textit{Toby} took it of him in the field,\tsh
convinced him, that if the King of \textit{Spain} and the
Emperor went together by the ears, that \textit{England} and
\textit{France} and \textit{Holland} must, by force of their
pre-engage\-ments, all enter the lists too;\tsh and if so, he
would say, the combatants, brother \textit{Toby}, as sure as we
are alive, will fall to it again, pell-mell, upon the old
prize-fighting stage of \textit{Flanders};\tsk then what will
you do with your \textit{Italian} bridge?

\tsk We will go on with it then, upon the old model, cried my
uncle \textit{Toby}.

When corporal \textit{Trim} had about half finished it in that
stile,\tsh my uncle \textit{Toby} found out a capital defect in
it, which he had never thoroughly considered before. It turned,
it seems, upon hinges at both ends of it, opening in the middle,
one\catch{half} half of which turning to one side of the fossè, and the
other, to the other; the advantage of which was this, that by
dividing the weight of the bridge into two equal portions, it
impowered my uncle \textit{Toby} to raise it up or let it down
with the end of his crutch, and with one hand, which, as his
garrison was weak, was as much as he could well spare,\tsk but
the disadvantages of such a construction were
insurmountable;\tsh for by this means, he would say, I leave one
half of my bridge in my enemy’s possession,\tsh and pray of what
use is the other?

The natural remedy for this, was no doubt to have his bridge
fast only at one end with hinges, so that the whole might be lifted
up together, and stand bolt upright,\tsh but that was
rejected for the reason given above.\patch{For}

For a whole week after he was determined in his mind to have one
of that particular construction which is made to draw back
horizontally, to hinder a passage; and to thrust forwards again to
gain a passage,\tsk of which sorts your worship might have seen
three famous ones at \textit{Spires} before its destruction,\tsk and
one now at \textit{Brisac}, if I mistake not;\tsk but my father
advising my uncle \textit{Toby}, with great earnestness, to have
nothing more to do with thrusting bridges,\tsk and my uncle
foreseeing moreover that it would but perpetuate the memory of the
corporal’s misfortune,\tsk he changed his mind for that of
the marquis \textit{d}’\textit{Hôpital}’s invention,
which the younger \textit{Bernouilli} has so well and learnedly
described, as your worships may see,\tsh \textit{Act.\@ Erud.\@
Lips.\@} an.\@ 1695,\tsk to these a lead weight is an eternal
ballance, and keeps watch as well as a\catch{couple} couple of centinels, inasmuch
as the construction of them was a curve-line approximating to a
cycloid,\tsh if not a cycloid itself.

My uncle \textit{Toby} understood the nature of a parabola as well
as any man in \textit{England}\tsk but was not quite such a master
of the cycloid;\tsk he talked however about it every
day,\tsh the bridge went not
forwards.\tsh We’ll ask somebody about it, cried my
uncle \textit{Toby} to \textit{Trim}.

\dropcap{W}{hen} \textit{Trim} came in and told my
father, that Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} was in the\break

\textit{Toby}\tsh the affair of the jack-boots having just then

what he had; so notwithstanding the catapulta and bat\-tering-ram, and his bitter

\dropcap{F}{rom} the first moment I sat down\break
to write my life for the amusement of the world, and my opinions
for its instruction, has a cloud insensibly been gathering over
my father.\tsh A tide of little evils and distresses has been
setting in against him.\tsk Not one thing, as he observed
himself, has gone right: and now is the storm thicken’d and
going to break, and pour down full upon his\break head.

I enter upon this part of my story in the most pensive and
melancholy frame of mind, that ever sympathetic breast\break
was touched with.\tsh My nerves re-\break
lax as I tell it.\tsh Every line I write,\break
I feel an abatement of the quickness of\catch{my}
my pulse, and of that careless alacrity with it, which every day
of my life\break prompts me to say and write a thousand things I
should not.\tsh And this moment that I last dipp’d my pen into
my ink, I could not help taking notice what a cautious air of
sad composure and solemnity there appear’d in my manner of doing
it.\tsh Lord! how different from the rash jerks and hair-brain’d
squirts thou art wont, \textit{Tristram!} to transact it with in
other humours,\tsk dropping thy pen,\tsk spurting thy ink about
thy table and thy books,\tsh as if thy pen and thy ink, thy
books and thy furniture cost\break thee nothing.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXIX.}

\dropcap{\Usk{20pt}I}{won\lower2pt\hbox{’}t} go about to argue the\break
point with you,\tsk ’tis so,\tsk and\catch{I am}
I am persuaded of it, madam, as much\break
as can be, \lqq That both man and woman\break
\lqq bear pain or sorrow, (and, for aught I\break
\lqq know, pleasure too) best in a horizon-\break
\lqq tal position.\,”

The moment my father got up into his chamber, he threw himself prostrate across his
bed in the wildest disorder im\-aginable, but at the same time in the
most lamentable attitude of a man borne down with sorrows, that
ever the eye of pity dropp’d a tear for.\tsh The
palm of his right hand, as he fell upon the bed, receiving his
forehead, and covering the greatest part of both his eyes, gently
sunk down with his head (his elbow giving way backwards) till his
nose touch’d the quilt;\tsh his left arm hung
insensible over the side of the bed, his knuckles reclining upon
the handle of the chamber\catch{pot,}
pot, which peep’d out beyond the va\-lance,\tsh his right leg (his
left being drawn up towards his body) hung half over the side of
the bed, the edge of it \stick{pressing upon his shin-bone.\tsh He felt}
it not. A fix’d, inflexible sorrow took\break possession of every line
of his face.\tsk He sigh’d once,\tsh heaved his breast
often,\tsk\break but utter’d not a word.

An old set-stitch’d chair, valanced and fringed around
with party-colour’d wor\-sted bobs, stood at the bed’s
head, opposite to the side where my father’s head
reclined.\tsk My uncle \textit{Toby} sat him down\break in it.

Before an affliction is digested,\tsh\break
consolation ever comes too soon;\tsk and 
after it is digested,\tsk it comes too late:
so that you see, madam, there is but a\catch{mark}
mark between these two, as fine almost as a hair, for a
comforter to take aim at: my uncle \textit{Toby} was always
either on this
\stick{side, or on that of it, and would often say,}\break
He believed in his heart, he could as soon hit the longitude;
for this reason, when he sat down in the chair, he drew the
cur-tain a little forwards, and having a tear at every one’s
service,\tsk he pull’d out a cambrick handkerchief,\tsh gave a
low sigh,\tsh but held his peace.

\textit{is not

notwithstanding my father had the happiness of reading the
oddest books in the universe, and had moreover, in himself, the
oddest way of thinking, that ever\catch{man} man in it was bless’d with, yet
it had this drawback upon him after all,\tsh that it laid him
open to some of the oddest and most whimsical distresses; of
which this particular one which he sunk under at present is as
strong an example as can be given.

No doubt, the breaking down of the bridge of a child’s
nose, by the edge of a pair of forceps,\tsk however scientifically
applied,\tsk would vex any man in the world, who was at so much
pains in begetting a child, as my father was,\tsk yet it will not
account for the extravagance of his affliction, or\sic\ will it justify
the unchristian manner he abandoned and surrender’d himself up
to.

To explain this, I must leave him upon\catch{the} the bed for half an
hour,\tsh and my good uncle \textit{Toby} in his old fringed
chair sitting beside him.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXXI.}

\initial{\Usk{20pt}I}{\lss{THINK}} it a very unreason\-able
demand,\tsk cried my great\break
grandfather, twisting up the paper,
and throwing it upon the table.\tsh By this account, madam, you
have but two thou\-sand pounds fortune, and not a shilling
more,\tsh and you insist upon having three hundred pounds a year
jointure for\break it,\tsk

\tsk \lqq Because,” replied my great-grand-\break
mother, \lqq you have little or no nose,\break
\lqq Sir.”\tsh

Now, before I venture to make use\catch{of}
of the word \textit{Nose} a
second time,\tsk to avoid all confusion in what will be said upon
it, in this interesting part of my story, it may not be amiss to
explain my own meaning, and define, with all possible exactness and
precision, what I would willingly be understood to mean by the
term: being of opinion, that ’tis owing\break to the negligence and
perverseness of writers in despising this precaution, and to
nothing else,\tsh
That all the polemi\-cal writings in divinity, are not as clear
\stick{and demonstrative as those upon \textit{a Will o’}}
\textit{the Wisp}, or any
other sound part of phi\-losophy, and natural pursuit; in order to
which, what have you to do, before you set out, unless you
intend to go puzzling on to the day of judgment,\tsh but
to\break
give the world a good definition, and stand to it, of the main
word you have most occasion for,\tsh changing it, Sir, as\catch{you}
you would a guinea, into small coin?\tsk which done,\tsk let the
father of confusion puzzle you, if he can; or put a different
idea either into your head, or your reader’s head, if he knows
how.

In books of strict morality and close reasoning, such as this I am
engaged\break in,\tsk the neglect is inexcusable; and hea\-ven is witness,
how the world has re\-venged itself upon me for leaving so many
openings to equivocal strictures,\tsk and for depending so much as
I have done, all along, upon the cleanliness of my reader’s
imaginations.

\tsh Here are two senses, cried \textit{Eu\-genius}, as we walk’d
along, pointing with the fore finger of his right hand to the
word \textit{Crevice}, in the fifty-second page of the second
volume of this book of books,\catch{\tsk here}
\tsh here are two senses,\tsk quoth he.\tsk And here are two
roads, replied I, turning short upon him,\tsh a dirty and a
clean one,\tsh which shall we take?\tsk\break
The clean,\tsk by all means, replied \textit{Eu\-genius}.  \textit{Eugenius},
said I, stepping before him, and laying my hand upon his\break
breast,\tsh to define\tsh is to distrust.\tsh\break
Thus I triumph’d over \textit{Eugenius}; but I triumph’d over
him as I always do, like a fool.\tsh ’Tis my comfort however, I
am not an obstinate one; therefore

I define a nose, as follows,\tsh intreat\-ing only beforehand, and
beseeching my readers, both male and female, of what age,
complexion, and condition soever, for the love of God and their own
souls, to guard against the temptations and suggestions of the
devil, and suffer him by no art or wile to put any other
ideas\catch{into}
into their minds, than what I put into my definition,\tsk For by
the word \textit{Nose}, throughout all this long chapter of
noses, and in every other part of my work,\break where the word
\textit{Nose} occurs,\tsk I declare, by that word I mean a Nose,
and nothing\break more, or less.

jointure, my dear, do we
\stick{pay out of this small estate of ours,}
\stick{quoth my grandmother to my grand-}
father.

My father, replied my grandfather,\break had no more nose, my dear,
saving the mark, than there is upon the back of my\break
hand.\tsh

\tsk Now, you must know, that my great grandmother outlived my
grandfather twelve years; so that my father\catch{had}
had the
jointure to pay, a hundred and fifty pounds half yearly\tsk (on
\textit{Michael-\break mas} and \textit{Lady day})\tsk during all
that\break
time.

No man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than
my father.\tsh And as far as a hundred pounds went, he
would fling it upon the table, guinea by guinea, with that spirited
jerk of an honest welcome, which generous souls, and generous souls
only, are able to fling down money: but as soon as ever he
enter’d upon the odd fifty,\tsk he\break generally gave a loud
\textit{Hem!} rubb’d the side of his nose leisurely with the
flat part of his fore finger,\tsh inserted his hand
cautiously betwixt his head and the cawl of his
wig,\tsk look’d at both sides of every guinea, as he parted
with it,\tsk and seldom\catch{could} could get to the end of the fifty
pounds, without pulling out his handkerchief\break and wiping his
temples.

Defend me, gracious heaven! from 
\stck{those persecuting spirits who make no al-}
lowances for these workings within us.\tsk Never,\tsk O never may I lay down in their
tents, who cannot relax the engine, and feel pity for the force of
education, and the prevalence of opinions long derived from
ancestors!

For three generations at least, this \textit{te\-net} in favour of
long noses had gradually been taking root in our family.\tsh
\textsc{Tradition} was all along on its side, and
\textsc{Interest} was every half year stepping in to strengthen
it; so that the whimsicality of my father’s brain was far
from\catch{having}
having the whole honour of this, as it had of almost all his
other strange notions.\tsk For in a great measure he might be
said to have suck’d this in, with his mother’s milk. He did his
part however.\tsh If\break
education planted the mistake, (in case it was one) my father
watered it, and ri\-pened it to perfection.

He would often declare, in speaking his thoughts upon the
subject, that he did not conceive how the greatest family in
\textit{England} could stand it out against an uninterrupted
succession of six or seven short noses.\tsk And for the contrary
reason, he would generally add, That it\break must be one of
the greatest problems in civil life, where the same number of long
and jolly noses following one another in a direct line, did not
raise and hoist it\catch{up} up into the best vacancies in the
kingdom.\tsh He would often boast that the \textit{Shandy}
family rank’d very high in king \textit{Harry} the
VIIIth’s time, but owed its rise to no state engine,\tsk he
would say,\tsk but to that only;\tsh but that, like other
families, he would add,\tsh it had felt the turn of the
wheel, and had never recovered the blow of my
great grandfather’s nose.\tsh It was an ace of clubs
indeed, he would cry, shaking his head,\tsk and as vile a one for
an unfortunate family,\break as ever turn’d up trumps.

\tsh Fair and softly, gentle reader!\break
\tsh where is thy fancy carrying thee?\break
\tsh If there is truth in man, by my
great grandfather’s nose, I mean the external organ of smelling,
or that part of man which stands prominent in his
face,\catch{and}
\tsk and which painters say, in good jolly\break
\tight{noses and well-proportioned faces, should}\break

\dropcap{I}{t} is a singular blessing, that
nature has form’d the mind of man with the same happy
backwardness and renitency against conviction, which is observed in
old dogs,\tsk “of not learning new tricks.”

What a shuttlecock of a fellow would the greatest philosopher
that ever exist-\break ed, be whisk’d into at once, did he read\catch{such}
such books, and observe such facts, and think such thoughts, as
would eternally be making him change sides!

Now, my father, as I told you last year, detested all
this,\tsk He pick’d up an opinion, Sir, as a man in a state
of nature picks up an apple.\tsk It becomes his own,\tsk\break
and if he is a man of spirit, he would lose his life rather than
give it up.\tsh

I am aware, that \textit{Didius}, the great civilian, will contest
this point; and cry out against me, Whence comes this man’s
right to this apple? \textit{ex confesso}, he will say,\tsh things
were in a state of nature.\break\tsk The apple, as much
\textit{Frank}’s apple, as \textit{John}’s. Pray, Mr.
\textit{Shandy}, what patent has he to shew for it? and how did it
begin to be his? was it, when he set\catch{his}
his heart upon it? or when he gather’d it? or when he chew’d it?
or when he\break roasted it? or when he peel’d? or when he brought it
home? or when he digest\-ed?\tsh or when he\tsh\tsk ?\tsh.\break For ’tis
plain, Sir, if the first picking up of the apple, made it not
his,\tsh that no\break
subsequent act could.

\tight{Brother \textit{Didius}, \textit{Tribonius} will answer,\tsk}\break
(now \textit{Tribonius} the civilian and church lawyer’s beard being
three inches and a half and three eighths longer than \textit{Didius}
his beard,\tsk I’m glad he takes up the cudgels for me, so I
give myself no further trouble about the answer.)\tsk Brother
\textit{Didius, Tribonius} will say, it is a decreed case, as you may
find it in the fragments of \textit{Gregorius} and
\textit{Hermogenes}’s codes, and in all the codes from
\textit{Justinian}’s down to\catch{the} the codes of \textit{Louis} and
\textit{Des Eaux},\tsk That the sweat of a man’s brows, and
the exsudations of a man’s brains, are as much a man’s
own property, as the breeches upon his backside;\tsk which said
exsudations, \etc\@ being dropp’d upon the said apple by the
labour of finding it, and picking it up; and being moreover
indissolubly wasted, and as indissolubly annex’d by the
picker up, to the thing\break pick’d up, carried home, roasted,
peel’d, eaten, digested, and so on;\tsh ’tis
evi\-dent that the gatherer of the apple, in so doing, has
mix’d up something which was his own, with the apple which
was not his own, by which means he has acquired a
property;\tsk or, in other words, the apple is
\textit{John}’s apple.

By the same learned chain of reason-\catch{ing} 
\stick{ing my father stood up for all his opi-}
\stick{nions: he had spared no pains in pick-}
\stick{ing them up, and the more they lay out}
\stick{of the common way, the better still was}
\stick{his title.\tsh No mortal claim’d them:}
\stick{they had cost him moreover as much la-}
\stick{bour in cooking and digesting as in the}
\stick{case above, so that they might well and}
\stick{truely be said to be of his own goods and}
chattles.\sic\tsk Accordingly he held fast by
\stick{’em, both by teeth and claws,\tsk would}
\stick{fly to whatever he could lay his hands}
\stick{on,\tsk and in a word, would intrench}
\stick{and fortify them round with as many cir-}
\stick{cumvallations and breast-works, as my}
uncle \textit{Toby} would a citadel.

There was one plaguy rub in the way of this,\tsh the
scarcity of materials to make any thing of a defence with, in
case\catch{of}
of a smart attack; inasmuch as few men of great genius had
exercised their parts in writing books upon the subject of\break 
great noses: by the trotting of my lean horse, the thing is
incredible!\@  and I am quite lost in my understanding, when I am
considering what a treasure of precious time and talents
together has been wasted upon worse subjects,\tsk and how many
millions of books in all languages, and in all possible types and
bindings, have been fabricated upon points not half so much
tending to the unity and peace-making of the world.  What was to
be had, however, he set the greater store\break by; and though my
father would oft-times sport with my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
li-\break brary,\tsk which, by the bye, was ridiculous enough,\tsk yet
at the very same time he did it, he collected every book\catch{and}
and treatise which had been systematically wrote upon
noses, with as much care as my honest uncle \textit{Toby} had done
those upon military architecture.\tsh ’Tis true, a
much less table would have held them,\tsk but that was not thy
transgression, my dear uncle.\tsh

Here,\tsh but why here,\tsh rather than in any
other part of my story,\tsh I am not able to
tell:\tsh but here it is,\tsh my heart stops me to
pay to\break
thee, my dear uncle \textit{Toby}, once for all, the tribute I
owe thy goodness.\tsh Here\break
let me thrust my chair aside, and kneel\break
down upon the ground, whilst I am\break
pouring forth the warmest sentiments\break
of love for thee, and veneration for\break
the excellency of thy character, that\break
ever virtue and nature kindled in a\catch{nephew’s}

\dropcap{O}{f} all the tracts my father was at
the pains to procure and study in support of his hypothesis, there
was not any one wherein he felt a more cruel disappointment at
first, than in the celebrated dialogue between \textit{Pamphagus} and
\textit{Cocles}, 
\stick{written by the chaste pen of the great and}
venerable \textit{Erasmus}, upon the various uses\catch{and}
\stck{and seasonable applications of long noses.}
\tsh Now don’t let Satan, my dear girl, 
\stick{in this chapter, take advantage of any one}
\stick{spot of rising-ground to get astride of}
your imagination, if you can any ways help it; or if he is so
nimble as to slip on,\tsh let me beg of you, like an un-\break back’d
filly, \textit{to frisk it}, 
\textit{to squirt it}, 
\textit{to jump it}, 
\textit{to rear it}, 
\textit{to bound it},\tsh 
\textit{and to kick it,\break with long kicks and short
kicks}, till like \textit{Tickletoby}’s mare, you break a
strap\break
or a crupper, and throw his worship\break
into the dirt.\tsh You need not kill\break
him.\tsh

\tsk And pray who was \textit{Tickletoby}’s
mare?\tsk ’tis just as discreditable and un\-scholar-like a
question, Sir, as to have asked what year (\textit{ab.\@ urb.\@

the second Punic war broke out.\tsk Who was
\textit{Tickle-}\catch{\textit{toby}’s}
\textit{toby}’s mare!\tsk Read, read, read, read, my\break
\stck{unlearned reader!\@ read,\tsk or by the know-}
ledge of the great saint \textit{Paraleipomenon}\tsk\break
I tell you before-hand, you had better
throw down the book at once; for without
\textit{much reading}, by which
your reverence knows, I mean \textit{much knowledge}, you\break
will no more be able to penetrate the moral of the next marbled page 
(motly emblem
of my work!)\@ than the world with all its sagacity has been able to

my father wished it, with the utmost plainness; but my

it, which heaven had bestow’d upon man on purpose to

Now, I find it needful to inform your reverences and worships,
that besides the many nautical uses of long noses enume\-rated by
\textit{Erasmus}, the dialogist affirmeth that a long nose is not
without its domes\-tic conveniences also, for that in a case of

\stick{first cried out to thee,\tsh go,\tsh

life,\tsk neglect thy pastimes,\tsk call forth all the
powers and faculties of thy nature,\break\tsh macerate thyself in
the service of mankind, and write a grand \textsc{folio} for
them, upon the subject of their noses.\hfill\catch{How}
\stick{\hfill How the communication was conveyed}
into \textit{Slawkenbergius}’s sensorium,\tsk so that
\textit{Slawkenbergius} should know whose finger touch’d the
key,\tsh and whose hand it was that blew the bellows,\tsh as
\textit{Hafen Slawkenbergius} has been dead and laid in his
grave above fourscore and ten years,\tsh we can only raise
conjectures.

\textit{Slawkenbergius} was play’d upon, for aught I know,
like one of \textit{Whitefield}’s disciples,\tsk that
is, with such a distinct\break
intelligence, Sir, of which of the two
\textit{masters} it was, that had been practising upon his
\textit{instrument},\tsh as to make all reasoning upon it
needless.

\tsh For in the account which \textit{Hafen Slawkenbergius}
gives the world of his\break motives and occasions for
writing, and\break spending so many years of his life
upon\catch{this} this one work.\tsk Towards the end of his
prolegomena, which by the bye should have come first,\tsh
but the bookbinder has most injudiciously placed it betwixt
the analitical\sic\ contents of the book, and the book
itself,\tsk he informs his reader, that ever since he had
arrived at the age of discernment, and was able to sit down
coolly, and consider within himself the true state and
condition of man, and distinguish the main end and design of
his being;\tsk or,\tsk to shorten my trans-\break
lation, for \textit{Slawkenbergius}’s book is in\break
\textit{Latin}, and not a little prolix in this pas-\break
sage,\tsk ever since I understood, quoth\break
\textit{Slawkenbergius}, any thing,\tsk or rather\break
\textit{what was what},\tsk and could perceive\break
that the point of long noses had been too\break
loosely handled by all who had gone be-\break 
fore;\tsh have I, \textit{Slawkenbergius}, felt a\break
strong impulse, with a mighty and un-\catch{resistible} resistible call
within me, to gird up myself to this undertaking.

\noindent
\stick{\hfill And to do justice to \textit{Slawkenbergius}, he}
has entered the
list with a stronger lance, and taken a much larger career in it,
than any one man who had ever entered it \stick{before
him,\tsk and indeed, in many resp-} ects, deserves to be
\textit{en-nich’d} as a prototype for all writers, of
voluminous works at least, to model their books by,\tsh for
he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject,\tsk examined every part
of it, \textit{dialectically},\tsk\break
then brought it into full
day; dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision
of his own natural parts could strike,\tsk or the profoundest
knowledge of the sciences had impowered him to cast upon
it,\tsk collating, collecting, and compiling,\tsk begging,
borrowing, and stealing, as he went along, all that had\catch{been}
been wrote or wrangled thereupon in the schools and porticos
of the learned: so that \textit{Slawkenbergius} his book may
properly be considered, not only as a model,\tsk but as a
thorough-stitch’d \textsc{digest} and regular institute of
\textit{noses}; comprehending in it, all that is, or can be
needful to be known about them.

For this cause it is, that I forbear to speak of so many
(otherwise) valuable books and treatises of my father’s
collecting, wrote either, plump upon noses,\tsh or
collaterally touching them;\tsh such for instance as
\textit{Prignitz}, now lying upon the table before me, who with
infinite learning, and from the most candid and scholar-like
examination of above four thousand different skulls, in upwards of
\stck{twenty charnel houses in \textit{Silesia}, which he} had
rummaged,\tsk has informed us, that\catch{the} the mensuration and
configuration of the osseous or boney parts of human noses, in any
\textit{given} tract of country, except \textit{Crim Tartary}, where
they are all crush’d down by the thumb, so that no judgment
can be formed upon them,\tsk are much nearer alike, than the world
imagines;\tsk the difference amongst them being, he says, a mere
trifle, not worth taking notice of,\break
\tsh but that the size and jollity of every individual nose, and by
which one nose ranks above another, and bears a higher price, is
owing to the cartilaginous and muscular parts of it, into whose
ducts and sinuses the blood and animal spirits being impell’d,
and driven by the warmth and force of the imagination, which is but
a step from it, (bating the case of idiots, whom \textit{Prignitz},
who had lived many years in \textit{Turky}, supposes under the more
immediate tutelage of heaven)\tsk it so\catch{hap-} happens, and ever must,
says \textit{Prignitz}, that the excellency of the nose is in a
direct arithmetical proportion to the excellency of the
wearer’s fancy.

It is for the same reason, that is, because ’tis all
comprehended in \textit{Slawkenbergius}, that I say nothing likewise
of \stick{\textit{Scroderus (Andrea)} who all the world} knows, set himself
to oppugn \textit{Prignitz} with great violence,\tsk proving it in
his own way, first, \textit{logically}, and then by a series of
stubborn facts, \lqq That so far was \textit{Prignitz} from
the truth, in affirming that the fancy begat the nose, that on the contrary,\tsk the nose begat
the fancy.\,”

\tsk The learned suspected \textit{Scroderus}, of an indecent
sophism in this,\tsk and \textit{Prignitz} cried out aloud in the
dispute, that \textit{Scroderus} had shifted the idea upon
him,\catch{but}
\tsk but \textit{Scroderus} went on, maintaining his
thesis.\tsh

My father was just balancing within himself, which of the
two sides he should take in this affair; when
\textit{Ambrose Paræus} decided it in a moment, and by
overthrowing the systems, both of \textit{Prignitz} and
\textit{Scroderus}, drove my father out of both sides of the
controversy at once.

Be witness\tsh

I don’t acquaint the learned reader,\tsk in saying it, I
mention it only to shew the learned, I know the fact
myself.\tsh

That this \textit{Ambrose Paræus} was chief surgeon and
nose-mender to \textit{Francis} the ninth of
\textit{France}, and in high credit with him and the two
preceding, or succeed-\catch{ing} ing kings (I know not which)\tsk and
that except in the slip he made in his story of
\textit{Taliacotius}’s noses, and his manner of setting them
on,\tsk was esteemed by the whole college of physicians
at that time, as more knowing in matters of noses, than any
one who had ever taken them in hand.

Now \textit{Ambrose Paræus} convinced my father, that the
true and efficient cause of what had engaged so much the attention
of the world, and upon which \textit{Prignitz} and \textit{Scroderus}
had wasted so much learning and fine parts,\tsh was neither
this nor that,\tsh but that the length and good-\break
\stick{ness of the nose was owing simply to the}
\stick{\tight{softness and flaccidity in the nurse’s breast,}}\break
\stick{\tsh as the flatness and shortness of \textit{puisne}}\break
noses was, to the firmness and elastic repulsion of
the same organ of nutri-\catch{tion} tion in the hale and lively,\tsk which,
tho’ happy for the woman, was the undoing of the child,
inasmuch as his nose was so snubb’d, so rebuff’d, so
rebated, and so refrigerated thereby, as never to arrive \textit{ad
mensuram suam legitimam};\tsh but that in case of the
flaccidity and softness of the nurse or mother’s
breast,\tsk by sinking into it, quoth \textit{Paræus}, as into so much butter, the
nose was comforted, nourish’d, plump’d up,
refresh’d, refocillated, and set a growing for ever.

I have but two things to observe of \textit{Paræus}; first, that
he proves and ex\-plains all this with the utmost chastity and\break
decorum of expression:\tsk for which may his soul for ever rest
in peace!

\noindent
\stick{\hfill And, secondly, that besides the systems} 
of \textit{Prignitz} and \textit{Scroderus}, which
\textit{Ambrose}\catch{\textit{Paræus}} \textit{Paræus} his
hypothesis effectually overthrew,\tsk it overthrew at the same
time the system of peace and harmony of our family; and for
three days together, not only embroiled matters between my
father and my mother, but turn’d likewise \stick{the whole house
and every thing in}\break \stick{it, except my uncle
\textit{Toby}, quite upside} down.

Such a ridiculous tale of a dispute between a man and his wife,
never surely in any age or country got vent through the key-hole of
a street-door!

My mother, you must know,\tsh but
I have fifty things more necessary to let 
you know first,\tsk I have a hundred
difficulties which I have promised to clear
up, and a thousand distresses and domestic 
misadventures crouding in upon me\catch{thick}

\stick{promised I would go back to them in}

\stick{\tsk for I have \textit{Hafen Slawkenbergius}’s folio,}

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XXXIX.}

\dropcap{T}{here} was not any one scene more
entertaining in our family,\tsk and\break to do it justice in this
point;\tsh and I\break here put off my cap and lay it upon the\break
table close beside my ink-horn, on purpose to make my declaration
to the world concerning this one article, the more
so\-lemn,\tsh that I believe in my soul, (un-\catch{less} less my love and
partiality to my understanding blinds me) the hand of the su\-preme
Maker and first Designer of all things, never made or put a family
toge\-ther, (in that period at least of it, which I have sat down to
write the story of)\tsh where the characters of it were cast
or contrasted with so dramatic a felicity as ours was, for this
end; or in which the\break
capacities of affording such exquisite\break
scenes, and the powers of shifting them perpetually from morning to night,
were lodged and intrusted with so unlimited a confidence, as in the
\textsc{Shandy-Family}.

Not any one of these was more diverting, I say, in this
whimsical theatre of ours,\tsk than what frequently arose
out of this self-same chapter of long noses,\tsh especially
when my father’s imagination \stck{was heated with the enquiry, and
nothing}\catch{would} would serve him but to heat my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
too.

My uncle \textit{Toby} would give my father all possible fair play
in this attempt; and with infinite patience would sit smoaking his
pipe for whole hours together, whilst my father was practising upon
his head, and trying every accessible avenue to drive
\textit{Prignitz} and \textit{Scroderus}’s solutions into it.

Whether they were above my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
reason,\tsh or contrary to it,\tsh or that his brain was like wet
tinder, and no spark could possibly take hold,\tsh or that
it was so full of saps, mines, blinds, curtins, and such military
disqualifications to his seeing clearly into \textit{Prignitz} and
\textit{Scroderus}’s doctrines,\tsk I say not,\tsk 
\stick{\tight{let school-men\tsk scullions, anatomists, and}}\catch{engi-} 
engineers, fight for it amongst them-\break selves,\tsh

’Twas some misfortune, I make no\break
doubt, in this affair,
that my father had every word of it to translate for the bene\-fit of
my uncle \textit{Toby}, and render out of
\textit{Slawkenbergius}’s \textit{Latin}, of which, as he was no
great master, his translation was not always of the
purest,\tsk and generally\break \tight{least so where ’twas most
wanted,\tsk this} naturally open’d a door to a second
misfortune;\tsk \tight{that in the warmer paroxisms}\break
of his zeal to open my uncle \textit{Toby}’s eyes\break
\tsh my father’s ideas run on, as much faster than the translation, as
the translation outmoved my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s;\tsh\break
neither the one or the other added much\break
to the perspicuity of my father’s lecture.

\dropcap{T}{he} gift of ratiocination and mak-\break
ing syllogisms,\tsh I mean in man,\break
\tsk for in superior classes of being, such\break
as angels and spirits,\tsh ’tis all done, may\break
it please your worships, as they tell me,\break
by \textsc{Intuition};\tsk and beings inferior, as\break
your worships all know,\tsk\tsk syllogize by\break
their noses: though there is an island\break
\tight{swiming\sic\ in the sea, though not altogether}\break
at its ease, whose inhabitants, if my intel-\break
ligence deceives me not, are so wonder-\break
fully gifted, as to syllogize after the same\break
fashion, and oft-times to make very well\break
out too:\tsh but that’s neither here nor\break
there\tsh

The gift of doing it as it should be, amongst us, \tsk or the
great and principal\catch{act} act of ratiocination in man, as logicians tell
us, is the finding out the agreement or disagreement of two ideas
one with another, by the intervention of a third; (called the
\textit{medius terminus)\sic} just as a man, as \textit{Locke} well
observes, by a yard, finds two mens nine-pin-alleys to be of the same
length, which could not be brought together, to measure their
equality, by \textit{juxta-position.}

Had the same great reasoner looked \stick{on, as my father illustrated
his systems of} noses, and observed my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
deportment,\tsk what great attention he gave to every
word,\tsk and as oft as he took his pipe from his mouth, with what
wonder-\break \tight{ful seriousness he contemplated the length} of
it,\tsk surveying it transversely as he held it betwixt his
finger and his thumb,\break\tsk then foreright,\tsk then
this way, and\catch{then} then that, in all its possible directions and
foreshortenings,\tsh he would have concluded my uncle
\textit{Toby} had got hold of the \textit{medius terminus}; and was
syllogizing and measuring with it the truth of each hypothesis of
long noses, in order, as my father laid them before him. This
by the bye, was more than my father wanted,\tsh his aim in
all the pains he was at in these philosophic lectures,\tsk was to
enable my uncle \textit{Toby} not to
\textit{discuss},\tsk but \textit{comprehend}\tsk to \textit{hold} the grains
and scruples of learning,\tsk not to \textit{weigh}
them.\tsk\break My uncle \textit{Toby}, as you will read in the
next chapter, did neither the one or the other.

\dropcap{’T}{is} a pity, cried my father
one winter’s night, after a three hours\break painful translation
of \textit{Slawkenbergius},\tsk ’tis a pity, cried my
father, putting my mother’s thread-paper into the book for a
mark, as he spoke\tsh that truth, bro\-ther \textit{Toby},
should shut herself up in such impregnable fastnesses, and be so
obstinate as not to surrender herself sometimes up upon the closest
siege.\tsh

\noindent
\stick{\hfill Now it happened then, as indeed it had} often
done before, that my uncle \textit{Toby}’s fancy, during the
time of my father’s explanation of \textit{Prignitz} to
him,\tsh having nothing to stay it there, had taken a short
flight to the bowling-green;\tsh his body might as well have
taken a turn there\catch{too,}
\stick{too,\tsk so that with all the semblance of}
\stick{\tight{a deep school-man intent upon the \textit{medius}}}

as ignorant
of the whole lecture, and all its pro’s and con’s, as if my
father had been translating \textit{Hafen Slawkenbergius}\break
from the \textit{Latin} tongue into the \textit{Cherokeè}.
But the word \textit{siege}, like a talismanic\break
power, in my
father’s metaphor, wafting back my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
fancy, quick as a note could follow the touch,\tsk he open’d
his ears,\tsk and my father observing that he took his pipe
out of his mouth, and shuffled his chair nearer the table,
as with a desire to profit,\tsk my father with great
pleasure began his sentence again,\tsh changing only the
plan, and dropping the metaphor of the siege of it, to keep
clear of some dangers my father apprehended from it.

’Tis a pity, said my father, that truth can only be on one
side, brother \textit{Toby},\,\tsk\break
\stck{considering what ingenuity these learned}
men have all shewn in their solutions of
noses.\tsh Can noses be dissolved? repli\-ed my uncle
\textit{Toby}.\tsh

\tsh My father thrust back his chair,\break
\tsh rose up,\tsk put on his
hat,\tsk took four long strides to the
door,\tsk jerked it open,\tsk thrust his head half
way out,\tsk shut the door again,\tsk took no
notice of the bad hinge,\tsk returned to the
table,\tsk\break pluck’d my mother’s thread-paper out of
\textit{Slawkenbergius}’s book,\tsk went hastily to his
bureau,\tsk walk’d slowly back, twisting my mother’s
thread-paper about his thumb,\tsk unbutton’d his
waistcoat,\tsh threw my mother’s thread-paper into the
fire,\tsk bit her sattin pin-cushion in two, fill’d
his mouth with bran,\tsk confound-\break ed it;\tsk but mark!\tsk the
oath of confu-\catch{sion}
\stck{sion was levell’d at my uncle \textit{Toby}’s brain,}
\tsh which was e’en confused enough already,\tsh the curse
came charged only with the bran,\tsk the bran, may it please
your honours,\tsk was no more than powder to the ball.

’Twas well my father’s passions lasted not long; for
so long as they did last, they led him a busy life on’t, and
it is one of the most unaccountable problems that ever I met with
in my observations of human nature, that nothing should prove my
father’s mettle so much, or make his passions go off so like
gun-powder, as the unexpected strokes his science met with from the
quaint simplicity of my uncle \textit{Toby}’s
questions.\tsh Had ten dozen of hornets stung him behind
in so many different places all at one time,\tsk he could not have
exerted more mechanical functions in fewer seconds,\tsk or
started half so\catch{much,} much, as with one single \textit{quære} of
three words unseasonably popping in full upon him in his
hobbyhorsical career.

’Twas all one to my uncle \textit{Toby}\tsk he
smoaked his pipe on, with unvaried composure,\tsk his heart
never intended offence to his brother,\tsk and as his head could
seldom find out where the sting of it lay,\break\tsh he always
gave my father the credit of cooling by himself.\tsh He
was five minutes and thirty-five seconds about it in the present
case.

By all that’s good!\@ said my father, swearing, as he came
to himself, and taking the oath out of \textit{Ernulphus}’s
digest of curses,\tsk (though to do my father
justice it was a fault (as he told Dr.\@ \textit{Slop} in the affair of

learned men of different
kinds of know\-ledge have given the world, of the causes of short and
long noses.\tsk There is no cause but one, replied my
uncle \textit{Toby},\tsk why one man’s nose is longer
than ano\-ther’s, but because that God pleases to
\stck{have it so.\tsk That is \textit{Grangousier}’s
solution,} said
my father.\tsk ’Tis he, continued my uncle \textit{Toby},
looking up, and not regarding my father’s interruption, who
makes us all, and frames and puts us together in such forms and
proportions, and for such ends, as is agreeable to his
infinite\break
\stick{wisdom.\tsh ’Tis a pious account, cried}\catch{my} my father,
but not philosophical,\tsk there is more religion in it than sound
science. ’Twas no inconsistent part of my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s character,\tsk that he feared God, and
reverenced religion.\tsh So the moment my father finished
his remark,\tsh my uncle \textit{Toby} fell a whistling
\textit{Lillabullero}, with more zeal (though more out of tune) than
usual.\tsh

What is become of my wife’s thread-paper?

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\quad  XLII.}

\dropcap[nindent=1pt]{N}{o} matter,\tsh as an appendage to\break
\tight{seamstressy, the thread-paper might}\break
be of some consequence to my
mother,\tsk of none to my father, \tight{as a mark in \textit{Slaw\-kenbergius.
Slawkenbergius} in every page of}\break
him was a rich treasure of inexhaustible\break
knowledge to my father,\tsk he could not\catch{open} 
open \enlargethispage\baselineskip
him amiss; and he would often say in closing the book,
that if all the arts and sciences in the world, with the
books which treated of them, were lost,\tsk\break should the
wisdom and policies of governments, he would say, through
dis-\break use, ever happen to be forgot, and all that statesmen had
wrote, or caused to be written, upon the strong or the weak
sides of courts and kingdoms, should\break they be forgot
also,\tsk and \textit{Slawkenbergius}\break only left,\tsk there
would be enough in him in all conscience, he would say, to
set the world a-going again. A treasure therefore was he
indeed! an institute of all that was necessary to be known
of noses, and every thing else,\tsk at \textit{matin}, noon,
and vespers was \textit{Hafen Slawkenbergius} his recreation
and delight: ’twas for ever in his hands,\tsh you would have
sworn, Sir, it had been a canon’s prayer-book,\tsk so worn,
so glazed, so contrited\catch{and} and attrited was it with fingers
and with thumbs in all its parts, from one end even unto the
other.

I am not such a bigot to \textit{Slawkenber\-gius} as my
father;\tsk there is a fund in him, no doubt: but in my
opinion, the best, I don’t say the most profitable,\break but
the most amusing part of \textit{Hafen}\break\textit{Slawkenbergius}, is
his tales,\tsh and, considering he was a \textit{German},
many of them told not without fancy:\tsh these take up\break his
second book, containing nearly one half of his folio, and are
comprehended in ten decads, each decad containing ten
tales.\tsh Philosophy is not built upon
\stck{tales; and therefore ’twas certainly wrong}
in \textit{Slawkenbergius} to send them into the 
world by that name;\tsk there are a few of 
\stck{them in his eight, ninth, and tenth decads,}
\stck{which I own seem rather playful and spor-}
tive, than speculative,\tsk but in general\catch{they}
they are to be looked upon by the learned as a detail of so many
independent facts, all of them turning round somehow or other upon
the main hinges of his subject, and added to his work as so many
illustrations upon the doctrines of noses.

As we have leisure enough upon our hands,\tsh if you
give me leave, madam, I’ll tell you the ninth tale of his
tenth decad.
