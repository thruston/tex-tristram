\dropcap{Y}{ou} \tight{see ’tis high time, said my father,}\break
\tighter{addressing himself equally to my un-}\break
\stick{cle \toby and \textit{Yorick}, to take this young} 
\stick{creature out of these women’s hands,}
\stick{and put him into those of a private go-}
\stick{vernor. \textit{Marcus Antoninus} provided four-}\catch{teen} 
\stick{teen governors all at once to superintend} 
\stick{his son \textit{Commodus}’s education,\tsk and in}
\stick{six weeks he cashiered five of them;\tsk} 
\stick{I know very well, continued my father,} 
\stick{that \textit{Commodus}’s mother was in love with} 
\stick{a gladiator at the time of her concep-}
\stick{tion, which accounts for a great many} 
\stick{of \textit{Commodus}’s cruelties when he became} 
\stick{emperor;\tsk but still I am of opinion,}
\stick{that those five whom \textit{Antoninus} dismiss-}
\stick{ed, did \textit{Commodus}’s temper in that short}
\stick{time, more hurt than the other nine} 
were able to rectify all their lives long.

Now as I consider the person who is\break
\stick{to be about my son, as the mirror in}
\stick{which he is to view himself from morn-}
\stick{ing to night, and by which he is to adjust} 
\stick{his looks, his carriage, and perhaps the}
\stick{inmost sentiments of his heart;\tsk I would}
\stick{have one, \textit{Yorick}, if possible, polished at}\catch{all} 
\stick{all points, fit for my child to look into.}
\stick{\tsh This is very good sense, quoth my}
uncle \toby to himself.

\tsh There is, continued my father,\break
\stick{a certain mien and motion of the body}
\stick{and all its parts, both in acting and}
\stick{speaking, which argues a man \textit{well}}
\stick{\textit{within}; and I am not at all surprized}
\stick{that \textit{Gregory} of \textit{Nazianzum}, upon ob-}

\stick{of \textit{Julian}, should foretel he would one}
\stick{day become an apostate;\tsh or that St.}
\stick{\textit{Ambrose} should turn his \textit{Amanuensis} out}
\stick{of doors, because of an indecent mo-}
\stick{tion of his head, which went backwards}
\stick{and forwards like a flail;\tsh or that} 
\stick{\textit{Democritus} should conceive \textit{Protagoras}} 
\stick{to be a scholar, from seeing him bind up} 
\stick{a faggot, and thrusting, as he did it,}
\stick{the small twigs inwards.\tsh There are a}\catch{thou-}
\stick{thousand unnoticed openings, continued} 
\stick{my father, which let a penetrating eye} 
\stick{at once into a man’s soul; and I main-}
\stick{tain it, added he, that a man of sense} 
\stick{does not lay down his hat in coming} 
\stick{into a room,\tsk or take it up in going out} 
\stick{of it, but something escapes, which dis-}
covers him.

It is for these reasons, continued my\break
\stick{father, that the governor I make choice}
\stick{of shall neither \fnast\ lisp, or squint, or wink,}
\stick{or talk loud, or look fierce, or foolish;}
\stick{\tsh or bite his lips, or grind his teeth,}
\stick{or speak through his nose, or pick it,}
or blow it with his fingers.\tsh

He shall neither walk fast,\tsk or slow,\break

or hide them in his pocket, for that is\break
nonsense.\tsh

He shall neither strike, or pinch, or\break
\stick{tickle,\tsk or bite, or cut his nails, or}
\stick{hawk, or spit, or snift, or drum with his} 
\stick{feet or fingers in company;\tsh nor (ac-}

\par\kern -24pt

\dropcap{I}{t} was some time in the summer of\break
that year in which \textit{Dendermond} was\break
\stick{taken by the allies,\tsk which was about}
\stick{seven years before my father came into} 
\stick{the country,\tsk and about as many, after}
\stick{the time, that my uncle \toby and \trim} 
\stick{had privately decamped from my father’s}
\stick{house in town, in order to lay some of}
\stick{the finest sieges to some of the finest}
\stick{fortified cities in \textit{Europe}\tsh when my}
\stick{uncle \toby was one evening getting his}
\stick{supper, with \trim sitting behind him at}
\stick{a small sideboard,\tsk I say, sitting\tsk for}\catch{in} 
\stick{in consideration of the corporal’s lame}
\stick{knee (which sometimes gave him exqui-} 
\stick{site pain)\tsk when my uncle \toby dined or}
\stick{supped alone, he would never suffer the}
\stick{corporal to stand; and the poor fellow’s}
\stick{veneration for his master was such, that,}
\stick{with a proper artillery, my uncle \toby}
\stick{could have taken \textit{Dendermond} itself,} 
\stick{with less trouble than he was able to}
\stick{gain this point over him; for many a}
\stick{time when my uncle \toby supposed the}
\stick{corporal’s leg was at rest, he would look}
\stick{back, and detect him standing behind} 
\stick{him with the most dutiful respect: this} 
\stick{bred more little squabbles betwixt them,}
\stick{than all other causes for five and twenty}
\stick{years together\tsk But this is neither here}
\stick{nor there\tsk why do I mention it?\tsh}
\stick{Ask my pen,\tsk it governs me,\tsk I govern}
not it.\patch{He}

He was one evening sitting thus at\break
\stick{his supper, when the landlord of a little}
\stick{inn in the village came into the parlour}
\stick{with an empty phial in his hand, to beg}
\stick{a glass or two of sack; ’Tis for a poor}
\stick{gentleman,\tsk I think, of the army, said}
\stick{the landlord, who has been taken ill at}
\stick{my house four days ago, and has never}
\stick{held up his head since, or had a desire}
\stick{to taste any thing, till just now, that}
\stick{he has a fancy for a glass of sack and a}
\stick{thin toast,\tsh \textit{I~think}, says he, taking}
\stick{his hand from his forehead, \textit{it would}}
\textit{comfort me.}\tsh

\tsh If I could neither\sic\ beg, borrow,\break
\stick{or buy such a thing,\tsk added the land-}
\stick{lord,\tsk I~would almost steal it for the}
\stick{poor gentleman, he is so ill.\tsh I hope}
\stick{in God he will still mend, continued he,}
\tsk we are all of us concerned for him.\patch{Thou}

Thou art a good natured soul, I will\break
\stick{answer for thee, cried my uncle \toby;} 
\stick{and thou shalt drink the poor gentle-}
\stick{man’s health in a glass of sack thyself,}
\stick{\tsk and take a couple of bottles with my}
\stick{service, and tell him he is heartily wel-}
\stick{come to them, and to a dozen more if}
they will do him good.

Though I am persuaded, said my un-\break
\stick{cle \toby, as the landlord shut the door,}
\stick{he is a very compassionate fellow\tsk \trim,}
\stick{\tsk yet I cannot help entertaining a high} 
\stick{opinion of his guest too; there must be}
\stick{something more than common in him,}
\stick{that in so short a time should win so} 
\stick{much upon the affections of his host;}
\stick{\tsh And of his whole family, added} 
\stick{the corporal, for they are all concerned}
\stick{for him.\tsh Step after him, said my}\catch{uncle\enspace} 
\stick{uncle \toby,\tsk do \trim,\tsk and ask if he} 
knows his name.

\tsh I have quite forgot it, truly,\break
\stick{said the landlord, coming back into the}
\stick{parlour with the corporal,\tsk but I can}
\stick{ask his son again:\tsh Has he a son with}
\stick{him then? said my uncle \toby.\tsk A boy,}
\stick{replied the landlord, of about eleven or}
\stick{twelve years of age;\tsk but the poor crea-}
\stick{ture has tasted almost as little as his fa-}
\stick{ther; he does nothing but mourn and}
\stick{lament for him night and day:\tsh He}
\stick{has not stirred from the bedside these}
two days.

My uncle \toby laid down his knife\break
\stick{and fork, and thrust his plate from be-}
\stick{fore him, as the landlord gave him the} 
\stick{account; and \trim, without being or-}
\stick{dered, took away without saying one}\catch{word,}
\stick{word, and in a few minutes after brought}
him his pipe and tobacco.

\tsh Stay in the room a little, said\break
my uncle \toby.\tsh

\textit{Trim!}\tsh said my uncle \toby, after\break
\stick{he lighted his pipe, and smoak’d about}
\stick{a dozen whiffs.\tsh \trim came in front}
\stick{of his master, and made his bow;\tsk my}
\stick{uncle \toby smoak’d on, and said no}
\stick{more.\tsh Corporal! said my uncle \toby}
\stick{\tsh the corporal made his bow.\tsh}
\stick{My uncle \toby proceeded no farther, but} 
finished his pipe.

\textit{Trim!} said my uncle \toby, I have a\break
\stick{project in my head, as it is a bad night,}
\stick{of wrapping myself up warm in my ro-}
\stick{quelaure, and paying a visit to this poor}
\stick{gentleman.\tsh Your honour’s roque-}\catch{laure,}

\stick{fore the gate of St.\@ \textit{Nicholas};\tsk and}
\stick{besides it is so cold and rainy a night,}
\stick{that what with the roquelaure, and what}
\stick{with the weather, ’twill be enough to} 
\stick{give your honour your death, and bring} 
\stick{on your honour’s torment in your groin.} 
\stick{I fear so; replied my uncle \toby, but I}
\stick{am not at rest in my mind, \trim, since} 
\stick{the account the landlord has given me.}
\stick{\tsh I wish I had not known so much of} 
\stick{this affair,\tsk added my uncle \toby,\tsk or}
\stick{that I had known more of it:\tsh How} 
\stick{shall we manage it?  Leave it, an’t}

\stick{\toby, and here’s a shilling for thee to} 
\stick{drink with his servant.\tsh I shall get it} 
\stick{all out of him, said the corporal, shut-}
ting the door.

My uncle \toby filled his second pipe;\break

\stick{then wandered from the point, with}
\stick{considering whether it was not full as} 
\stick{well to have the curtain of the tennaile}

\centerline{\textit{The Story of} \textscl{Le Fever} \textit{continued}.}

\dropcap{I}{t} was not till my uncle \toby had\break
knocked the ashes out of his third\break
\stick{pipe, that corporal \trim returned from} 
\stick{the inn, and gave him the following}
account.

I despaired at first, said the corporal,\break
\stick{of being able to bring back your honour}
\stick{any kind of intelligence concerning the}
\stick{poor sick lieutenant\tsk Is he in the army}
\stick{then?  said my uncle \textit{Toby}\tsh He is:}
\stick{said the corporal\tsh And in what re-}
\stick{giment?  said my uncle \textit{Toby}\tsh I’ll tell}
\stick{your honour, replied the corporal, every}
\stick{thing straight forwards, as I learnt it.\tsk}
\stick{Then, \trim, I’ll fill another pipe, said}
\stick{my uncle \toby, and not interrupt thee}\catch{till} 
\stick{till thou hast done; so sit down at thy}
\stick{ease, \trim, in the window seat, and be-}
\stick{gin thy story again.  The corporal made}
\stick{his old bow, which generally spoke as} 
\stick{plain as a bow could speak it\tsk \textit{Your}}
\stick{\textit{honour is good:}\tsk And having done}
\stick{that, he sat down, as he was ordered,\tsk}
\stick{and begun the story to my uncle \toby} 
\stick{over again in pretty near the same}
words.

I despaired at first, said the corporal,\break
\stick{of being able to bring back any intelli-}
\stick{gence to your honour, about the lieute-}
\stick{nant and his son; for when I asked}
\stick{where his servant was, from whom I} 
\stick{made myself sure of knowing every}
\stick{thing which was proper to be asked,\tsk}
\stick{That’s a right distinction, \trim, said my} 
\stick{uncle \textit{Toby}\tsk I was answered, an’ please} 
\stick{your honour, that he had no servant}\catch{with} 
\stick{with him;\tsh that he had come to the}
\stick{inn with hired horses, which, upon}
\stick{finding himself unable to proceed, (to}
\stick{join, I suppose, the regiment) he had}
\stick{dismissed the morning after he came.\tsk}
\stick{If I get better, my dear, said he, as he}
\stick{gave his purse to his son to pay the man,}
\stick{\tsk we can hire horses from hence.\tsh}
\stick{But alas! the poor gentleman will never}
\stick{get from hence, said the landlady to me,}
\stick{\tsk for I heard the death-watch all night}
\stick{long;\tsh and when he dies, the youth,}
\stick{his son, will certainly die with him;}
for he is broken-hearted already.

I was hearing this account, continued\break
\stick{the corporal, when the youth came into}
\stick{the kitchen, to order the thin toast the}
\stick{landlord spoke of;\tsh but I will do it}
\stick{for my father myself, said the youth.}
\stick{\tsh Pray let my save you the trouble,}\catch{young}
\stick{young gentleman, said I, taking up a}
\stick{fork for the purpose, and offering him}
\stick{my chair to sit down upon by the fire,}
\stick{whilst I did it.\tsh I believe, Sir, said he,}
\stick{very modestly, I can please him best}
\stick{myself.\tsh I am sure, said I, his honour}
\stick{will not like the toast the worse for being}
\stick{toasted by an old soldier.\tsh The youth}
\stick{took hold of my hand, and instantly}
\stick{burst into tears.\tsk Poor youth! said}
\stick{my uncle \toby,\tsk he has been bred up}
\stick{from an infant in the army, and the}
\stick{name of a soldier, \trim, sounded in his}
\stick{ears like the name of a friend;\tsk I wish}
I had him here.

\tsh I never, in the longest march,\break
\stick{said the corporal, had so great a mind to}
\stick{my dinner, as I had to cry with him} 
\stick{for company:\tsk What could be the mat-}
\stick{ter with me, an’ please your honour?}\catch{Nothing} 
\stick{Nothing in the world, \trim, said my}
\stick{uncle \toby, blowing his nose,\tsk but that} 
thou art a good natured fellow.

When I gave him the toast, continued\break
\stick{the corporal, I thought it was proper to}
\stick{tell him I was Captain \textit{Shandy}’s servant,}
\stick{and that your honour (though a stran-} 
\stick{ger) was extremely concerned for his}
\stick{father;\tsk and that if there was any thing}
\stick{in your house or cellar\tsh (And thou}
\stick{might’st have added my purse too, said}
\stick{my uncle \toby)\tsh he was heartily wel-}
\stick{come to it:\tsh He made a very low} 
\stick{bow, (which was meant to your honour)} 
\stick{but no answer,\tsk for his heart was full\tsk} 
\stick{so he went up stairs with the toast;\tsk I}
\stick{warrant you, my dear, said I, as I open-}
\stick{ed the kitchen door, your father will be}
\stick{well again.\tsh Mr.\@ \textit{Yorick}’s curate was}\catch{smoak-} 
\stick{smoaking a pipe by the kitchen fire,\tsk} 
\stick{but said not a word good or bad to com-}
\stick{fort the youth.\tsh I thought it wrong;} 
\stick{added the corporal\tsh I think so too,} 
said my uncle \textit{Toby.}

When the lieutenant had taken his\break
\stick{glass of sack and toast, he felt himself}
\stick{a little revived, and sent down into the}
\stick{kitchen, to let me know, that in about}
\stick{ten minutes he should be glad if I}
\stick{would step up stairs.\tsh I believe, said}
\stick{the landlord, he is going to say his}
\stick{prayers,\tsh for there was a book laid} 
\stick{upon the chair by his bedside, and as I} 
\stick{shut the door, I saw his son take up a}
cushion.\tsh

I thought, said the curate, that you\break
\stick{gentlemen of the army, Mr.\@ \trim, never}
\stick{said your prayers at all.\tsh I heard the}\catch{poor}
\stick{poor gentleman say his prayers last}
\stick{night, said the landlady, very devoutly,}
\stick{and with my own ears, or I could not} 
\stick{have believed it.\tsh Are you sure of it?} 
\stick{replied the curate.\tsh A soldier, an’}
\stick{please your reverence, said I, prays as} 
\stick{often (of his own accord) as a parson;}
\stick{\tsh and when he is fighting for his} 
\stick{king, and for his own life, and for his}
\stick{honour too, he has the most reason to}
\stick{pray to God, of any one in the whole}
\stick{world\tsh ’Twas well said of thee, \trim,}
\stick{said my uncle \textit{Toby.}\tsh But when a sol-}
\stick{dier, said I, an’ please your reverence,}
\stick{has been standing for twelve hours toge-}
\stick{ther in the trenches, up to his knees in}
\stick{cold water,\tsk or engaged, said I, for}
\stick{months together in long and dangerous}
\stick{marches;\tsk harassed, perhaps, in his}
\stick{rear to-day;\tsk harassing others to-mor-}
\stick{row;\tsk detached here;\tsk countermanded}\catch{there;}
\stick{there;\tsk resting this night out upon his}
\stick{arms;\tsk beat up in his shirt the next;\tsk} 
\stick{benumbed in his joints;\tsk perhaps with-}
\stick{out straw in his tent to kneel on;\tsk must}
\stick{say his prayers \textit{how} and \textit{when} he can.\tsk}
\stick{I believe, said I,\tsk for I was piqued,}
\stick{quoth the corporal, for the reputation} 
\stick{of the army,\tsk I believe, an’ please your}
\stick{reverence, said I, that when a soldier} 
\stick{gets time to pray,\tsk he prays as heartily} 
\stick{as a parson,\tsk though not with all his} 
\stick{fuss and hypocrisy.\tsh Thou shouldst} 
\stick{not have said that, \trim, said my uncle} 
\stick{\toby,\tsk for God only knows who is a hy-}
\stick{pocrite, and who is not:\tsh At the} 
\stick{great and general review of us all, cor-}
\stick{poral, at the day of judgment, (and} 
\stick{not till then)\tsk it will be seen who has} 
\stick{done their duties in this world,\tsk and} 
\stick{who has not; and we shall be advanced,} 
\stick{\trim, accordingly.\tsh I hope we shall,}\catch{said}
\stick{said \textit{Trim.}\tsh It is in the Scripture, said}
\stick{my uncle \toby; and I will shew it thee}
\stick{to-morrow:\tsk In the mean time we}
\stick{may depend upon it, \trim, for our} 
\stick{comfort, said my uncle \toby, that God}
\stick{Almighty is so good and just a gover-}
\stick{nor of the world, that if we have but} 
\stick{done our duties in it,\tsk it will never be}
\stick{enquired into, whether we have done} 
\stick{them in a red coat or a black one:\tsk}
\stick{I hope not; said the corporal\tsk But}
\stick{go on, \trim, said my uncle \toby, with}
thy story.

When I went up, continued the cor-\break
\stick{poral, into the lieutenant’s room, which} 
\stick{I did not do till the expiration of the} 
\stick{ten minutes,\tsk he was lying in his bed} 
\stick{with his head raised upon his hand,} 
\stick{with his elbow upon the pillow, and a}
\stick{clean white cambrick handkerchief be-}\catch{side}
\stick{side it:\tsh The youth was just stooping}
\stick{down to take up the cushion, upon} 
\stick{which I supposed he had been kneeling,}
\stick{\tsk the book was laid upon the bed,\tsk}
\stick{and as he rose, in taking up the cushion}
\stick{with one hand, he reached out his other}
\stick{to take it away at the same time.\tsh}
\stick{Let it remain there, my dear, said the} 
lieutenant.

He did not offer to speak to me, till\break
\stick{I had walked up close to his bed-side:\tsk}
\stick{If you are captain \textit{Shandy}’s servant, said} 
\stick{he, you must present my thanks to your}
\stick{master, with my little boy’s thanks} 
\stick{along with them, for his courtesy to}
\stick{me;\tsk if he was of \textit{Levens}’s\tsk said the}
\stick{lieutenant.\tsk I told him your honour}
\stick{was\tsk Then, said he, I served three cam-}
\stick{paigns with him in \textit{Flanders}, and re-}
\stick{member him,\tsk but ’tis most likely, as}\catch{I had}
\stick{I had not the honour of any acquaint-}
\stick{ance with him, that he knows nothing} 
\stick{of me.\tsh You will tell him, however,}
\stick{that the person his good nature has laid}
\stick{under obligations to him, is one \textit{Le}}
\stick{\textit{Fever}, a lieutenant in \textit{Angus}’s\tsk but}
\stick{he knows me not,\tsk said he, a second}
\stick{time, musing;\tsk possibly he may}
\stick{my story\tsk added he\tsk pray tell the cap-}
\stick{tain, I was the ensign at \textit{Breda}, whose} 
\stick{wife was most unfortunately killed with}
\stick{a musket shot, as she lay in my arms in} 
\stick{my tent.\tsh I remember the story, an’t} 
\stick{please your honour, said I, very well.}
\stick{\tsh Do you so? said he, wiping his} 
\stick{eyes with his handkerchief,\tsk then well}
\stick{may I.\tsk In saying this, he drew a little}
\stick{ring out of his bosom, which seemed}
\stick{tied with a black ribband about his neck,} 
\stick{and kiss’d it twice\tsh Here, \textit{Billy}, said}
\stick{he,\tsk the boy flew across the room to}\catch{the}
\stick{the bed-side,\tsk and falling down upon}
\stick{his knee, took the ring in his hand, and}
\stick{kissed it too,\tsk then kissed his father,}
and sat down upon the bed and wept.

I wish, said my uncle \toby, with a\break
deep sigh,\tsk I wish, \trim, I was asleep.

Your honour, replied the corporal,\break
\stick{is too much concerned;\tsk shall I pour}
\stick{your honour out a glass of sack to your} 
\stick{pipe?\tsh Do, \trim, said my uncle}
\textit{Toby.}

I remember, said my uncle \toby,\break
\stick{sighing again, the story of the ensign} 
\stick{and his wife, with a circumstance his}
\stick{modesty omitted;\tsk and particularly well}
\stick{that he, as well as she, upon some ac-}
\stick{count or other, (I forget what) was uni-}
\stick{versally pitied by the whole regiment;}\catch{\tsk but} 
\stick{\tsk but finish the story thou art upon:}
\stick{\tsk ’Tis finished already, said the corpo-}
\stick{ral,\tsk for I could stay no longer,\tsk so}
\stick{wished his honour a good night; young}
\stick{\textit{Le Fever} rose from off the bed, and saw} 
\stick{me to the bottom of the stairs; and as}
\stick{we went down together, told me, they} 
\stick{had come from \textit{Ireland}, and were on}
\stick{their route to join the regiment in \textit{Flan}-}
\stick{\textit{ders}.\tsh But alas! said the corporal,\tsk}
\stick{the lieutenant’s last day’s march is over.}  
\stick{\tsk Then what is to become of his poor}
boy? cried my uncle \textit{Toby.}

\stick{thee in what, \textit{Trim.}\tsh In the first}

\initial{I}{Am} so impatient to return to my own\break
story, that what remains of young\break
\stick{\textit{Le Fever}’s, that is, from this turn} 
\stick{of his fortune, to the time my uncle \textit{Toby}}
\stick{recommended him for my preceptor,} 
\stick{shall be told in a very few words in the}
\stick{next chapter.\tsk All that is necessary to} 
be added to this chapter is as follows.\tsk 

That my uncle \toby, with young \textit{Le}\break
\stick{\textit{Fever} in his hand, attended the poor}
\stick{lieutenant, as chief mourners, to his}
grave.\patch{That}

\indent\vrule width 0pt height 18pt
That the governor of \textit{Dendermond} paid\break
\stick{his obsequies all military honours,\tsk and} 
\stick{that \textit{Yorick}, not to be behind-hand\tsk}
\stick{paid him all ecclesiastic\tsk for he buried}
\stick{him in his chancel:\tsk And it appears}
\stick{likewise, he preached a funeral sermon} 
\stick{over him\tsh I say it \textit{appears},\tsk for it}
\stick{was \textit{Yorick}’s custom, which I suppose a} 
\stick{general one with those of his profession,} 
\stick{on the first leaf of every sermon which}
\stick{he composed, to chronicle down the}
\stick{time, the place, and the occasion of its}
\stick{being preached: to this, he was ever} 
\stick{wont to add some short comment or}
\stick{stricture upon the sermon itself, seldom,}
\stick{indeed, much to its credit:\tsk For in-} 
\stick{stance, \textit{This sermon upon the jewish dispen}-}
\stick{\textit{sation\tsk I don’t like it at all};\tsk \textit{Though I}}
\stick{\textit{own there is a world of} \textscl{water-landish}}

\stick{\textit{most tritically put together.\tsh This is}}
\stick{\textit{but a flimsy kind of a composition}; \textit{what}}
\textit{was in my head when I made it?}

\tsk N.\@ B.\@ \textit{The excellency of this text\break 
is, that it will suit any sermon,\tsk and of\break 
this sermon,\tsk that it will suit any\break
text}.\tsh

\tsh \textit{For this sermon I shall be hanged,\break
\tsk for I have stolen the greatest part of it.\break
Doctor} Paidagunes \textit{found me out.\hfill \fist  Set\break
a  thief to catch a thief}.\tsh

On the back of half a dozen I find\break
\stick{written, \textit{So}, \textit{so}, and no more\tsh and} 
\stick{upon a couple \textit{Moderato}; by which, as} 
\stick{far as one may gather from \textit{Altieri’s Ita}-}
\stick{\textit{lian} dictionary,\tsk but mostly from the}
\stick{authority of a piece of green whipcord,}
\stick{which seemed to have been the unravel-}\catch{ling} 
\stick{ling of \textit{Yorick}’s whip-lash, with which} 
\stick{he has left us the two sermons marked}
\stick{\textit{Moderato}, and the half dozen of \textit{So}, \textit{so},} 
\stick{tied fast together in one bundle by them-}
\stck{selves,\tsk one may safely suppose he meant}
pretty near the same thing.

There is but one difficulty in the way\break
\stick{of this conjecture, which is this, that}
\stick{the \textit{moderato}’s are five times better than}
\stick{the \textit{so}, \textit{so}’s;\tsk shew ten times more know-}
\stick{lege\sic of the human heart;\tsk have seventy} 
\stick{times more wit and spirit in them;\tsk} 
\stick{(and, to rise properly in my climax)\tsk} 
\stick{discover a thousand times more genius;}
\stick{\tsk and to crown all, are infinitely more}
\stck{entertaining than those tied up with them;}
\stick{\tsk for which reason, whene’er \textit{Yorick}’s}
\stck{\textit{dramatic} sermons are offered to the world,} 
\stick{though I shall admit but one out of the} 
\stick{whole number of the \textit{so}, \textit{so}’s, I shall,}\catch{never-}
\stick{nevertheless, adventure to print the two}
\textit{moderato}’s without any sort of scruple.

What \textit{Yorick} could mean by the words\break
\stick{\textit{lentamente},\tsk \textit{tenutè},\tsk \textit{grave},\tsk and some-} 
\stick{times \textit{adagio},\tsk as applied to \textit{theological}}
\stick{compositions, and with which he has} 
\stick{characterized some of these sermons, I} 
\stick{dare not venture to guess.\tsh I am more}
\stick{puzzled still upon finding \textit{a l’octava alta!}}
\stick{upon one;\tsh \textit{Con strepito} upon the back}
\stick{of another;\tsh \textit{Scicilliana} upon a third;}
\stick{\tsk \textit{Alla capella} upon a fourth;\tsk}
\stick{\textit{Con l’arco} upon this;\tsk \textit{Senza l’arco}}
\stick{upon that.\tsh All I know is, that they}
\stick{are musical terms, and have a mean-}
\stick{ing;\tsh and as he was a musical man,}
\stick{I will make no doubt, but that by some}
\stick{quaint application of such metaphors to}
\stick{the compositions in hand, they impressed}
\stick{very distinct ideas of their several cha-}\catch{racters} 
\stick{racters upon his fancy,\tsk whatever they}
may do upon that of others.

Amongst these, there is that particular\break
\stick{sermon which has unaccountably led me}
\stick{into this digression\tsh The funeral ser-}
\stick{mon upon poor \textit{Le Fever}, wrote out}
\stick{very fairly, as if from a hasty copy.\tsk I} 
\stick{take notice of it the more, because it}
\stick{seems to have been his favourite compo-}
\stick{sition\tsh It is upon mortality; and is}
\stick{tied length-ways and cross-ways with a}
\stick{yarn thrum, and then rolled up and}
\stick{twisted round with a half sheet of dirty}
\stick{blue paper, which seems to have been} 
\stick{once the cast cover of a general review,}
\stick{which to this day smells horribly of}
\stick{horse-drugs.\tsh Whether these marks}
\stick{of humiliation were designed,\tsk I some-}
\stick{thing doubt;\tsh because at the end of}
\stick{the sermon, (and not at the beginning}\catch{of}
\stick{of it)\tsk very different from his way of}
\stick{treating the rest, he had wrote\tsk\qquad}
\stick{\hfill Bravo! \hfill}
\stick{\indent\tsk Though not very offensively,}
\stick{\tsk for it is at two inches, at least,}
\stick{and a half’s distance from, and below} 
\stick{the concluding line of the sermon, at}
\stick{the very extremity of the page, and in}
\stick{that right hand corner of it, which, you}
\stick{know, is generally covered with your}
\stick{thumb; and, to do it justice, it is wrote}
\stick{besides with a crow’s quill so faintly in a} 
\stick{small \textit{Italian} hand, as scarce to sollicit} 
\stick{the eye towards the place, whether your}
\stick{thumb is there or not,\tsk so that from the} 
\stick{\textit{manner of it}, it stands half excused;} 
\stick{and being wrote moreover with very pale}
\stick{ink, diluted almost to nothing,\tsk ’tis}
\stick{more like a \textit{ritratto} of the shadow of va-}
\stick{nity, than of \textscl{Vanity} herself\tsk of the} 
\stick{two; resembling rather a faint thought}\catch{of}
\stick{of transient applause, secretly stirring}
\stick{up in the heart of the composer, than a}
\stick{gross mark of it, coarsely obtruded}
upon the world.

With all these extenuations, I am\break
\stick{aware, that in publishing this, I do no}
\stick{service to \textit{Yorick}’s character as a modest}
\stick{man;\tsk but all men have their failings!}
\stick{and what lessens this still farther, and}
\stick{almost wipes it away, is this; that the}
\stick{word was struck through sometime af-}
\stick{terwards (as appears from a different}
\stick{tint of the ink) with a line quite across} 
\stick{it in this manner, \hbox to
34pt{\rlap{\,BRAVO}\leaders\hrule width
1pt height 3.4pt depth -3.1pt\hfill}\tsk as if}
\stick{he had retracted, or was ashamed of the} 
opinion he had once entertained of it.

These short characters of his sermons\break 
\stick{were always written, excepting in this}
\stick{one instance, upon the first leaf of his}\catch{sermon,}
\stick{sermon, which served as a cover to it;}
\stick{and usually upon the inside of it, which}
\stick{was turned towards the text;\tsk but at}
\stick{the end of his discourse, where, perhaps,}
\stick{he had five or six pages, and sometimes,}
\stick{perhaps, a whole score to turn himself}
\stick{in,\tsk he took a large circuit, and, in-}
\stick{deed, a much more mettlesome one;\tsk}
\stick{as if he had snatched the occasion of un-}
\stick{lacing himself with a few more frolick-}
\stick{some strokes at vice, than the straitness}
\stick{of the pulpit allowed.\tsk These, though}
\stick{hussar-like, they skirmish lightly and}
\stick{out of all order, are still auxiliaries on the}
\stick{side of virtue\tsk\!; tell me then, Mynheer}

Sir, both in church and state, as\break

\stick{prove her existence) could neither have} 
wished it, or done it better.

Of the number of these was my fa-\break
\stick{ther’s resolution of putting me into} 
\stick{breeches; which, though determined}
\stick{at once,\tsk in a kind of huff, and a defi-}
\stick{ance of all mankind, had, nevertheless,}
\stick{been \textit{pro}’\textit{d} and \textit{conn}’\textit{d}, and judicially talk-}

\stick{kind of manner my father and my mo-}
\stick{ther debated between themselves, this}
\stick{affair of the breeches,\tsk from which you}
\stick{may form an idea, how they debated all}
lesser matters.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XVII.}

\dropcap{T}{he} ancient \textit{Goths} of \textit{Germany}, who\break
(the learned \textit{Cluverius} is positive)\break
\stick{were first seated in the country between} 
\stick{the \textit{Vistula} and the \textit{Oder}, and who after-}
\stick{wards incorporated the \textit{Herculi}, the \textit{Bu}-}
\stick{\textit{gians}, and some other \textit{Vandallick} clans}
\stick{to ’em,\tsk had all of them a wise custom}
\stick{of debating every thing of importance}\catch{to} 
\stick{to their state, twice; that is,\tsk once}
\stick{drunk, and once sober:\tsh Drunk\tsk} 
\stick{that their councils might not want vi-}
\stick{gour;\tsh and sober\tsk that they might}
not want discretion.

Now my father being entirely a water-\break
\stick{drinker,\tsk was a long time gravelled}
\stick{almost to death, in turning this as much} 
\stick{to his advantage, as he did every other} 
\stick{thing which the ancients did or said;}
\stick{and it was not till the seventh year of his}
\stick{marriage, after a thousand fruitless ex-}
\stick{periments and devices, that he hit upon} 
\stick{an expedient which answered the pur-}
\stick{pose;\tsh and that was when any diffi-}
\stick{cult and momentous point was to be set-}
\stick{tled in the family, which required great} 
\stick{sobriety, and great spirit too, in its de-}
\stick{termination,\tsh he fixed and set apart}
\stick{the first \textit{Sunday} night in the month, and}\catch{the}
\stick{the \textit{Saturday} night which immediately}
\stick{preceded it, to argue it over, in bed}
\stick{with my mother: By which contrivance,}
\stick{if you consider, Sir, with
yourself,\quad \vastfill{1.4em}}
\stick{\vastfill{1.414em}}
\stick{\vastfill{1.414em}}
\stick{\vastfill{1.414em}}
\hbox to 80pt{\vastfill{1.414em}}.

These my father, humorously enough,\break
\stick{called his \textit{beds of justice};\tsh for from}
\stick{the two different counsels taken in these}
\stick{two different humours, a middle one} 
\stick{was generally found out, which touched} 
\stick{the point of wisdom as well, as if he}
\stick{had got drunk and sober a hundred} 
times.

It must not be made a secret of to the\break
\stick{world, that this answers full as well in}
\stick{literary discussions, as either in military}\catch{or} 
\stick{or conjugal; but it is not every author}
\stick{that can try the experiment as the \textit{Goths}} 
\stick{and \textit{Vandals} did it\tsh or, if he can,} 
\stick{may it be always for his body’s health;}
\stick{and to do it, as my father did it,\tsk}
\stick{am I sure it would be always for his}
soul’s.

My way is this:\tsh

In all nice and ticklish discussions,\tsk\break
\stick{(of which, heaven knows, there are}
\stick{but too many in my book)\tsk where I} 
\stick{find I cannot take a step without the}
\stick{danger of having either their worships} 
\stick{or their reverences upon my back\tsh}
\stick{I write one half \textit{full},\tsk and t’other \textit{fast}-}
\stick{\textit{ing};\tsh or write it all full,\tsk and cor-} 
\stick{rect it fasting;\tsh or write it fasting,\tsk} 
\stick{and correct it full, for they all come to}
\stick{the same thing:\tsh So that with a less}\catch{variation} 
\stick{variation from my father’s plan, than} 
\stick{my father’s from the \textit{Gothick}\tsk I feel} 
\stick{myself upon a par with him in his first}
\stick{bed of justice,\tsk and no way inferior to} 
\stick{him in his second.\tsh These different} 
\stick{and almost irreconcileable effects, flow} 
\stick{uniformly from the wise and wonderful} 
\stick{mechanism of nature,\tsk of which,\tsk be}
\stick{her’s the honour.\tsh All that we can do,}
\stick{is to turn and work the machine to the} 
\stick{improvement and better manufactory} 
of the arts and sciences.\tsh

Now, when I write full,\tsk I write as if\break
\stick{I was never to write fasting again as long}
\stick{as I live;\tsh that is, I write free from}
\stick{the cares, as well as the terrors of the}
\stick{world.\tsh I count not the number of}
\stick{my scars,\tsk nor does my fancy go forth}
\stick{into dark entries and bye corners to ante-}
\stick{date my stabs.\tsh In a word, my pen}\catch{takes} 
\stick{takes its course; and I write on as much} 
\stick{from the fullness of my heart, as my}
stomach.\tsh

But when, an’ please your honours,\break 
\stick{I indite fasting, ’tis a different history.}
\stick{\tsh I pay the world all possible atten-}
\stick{tion and respect,\tsk and have as great a}
\stick{share (whilst it lasts) of that understrap-}
\stick{ping virtue of discretion, as the best of}
\stick{you.\tsh So that betwixt both, I write a}
\stick{careless kind of a civil, nonsensical, good} 
\stick{humoured \textit{Shandean} book, which will}
do all your hearts good\tsh

\tsh\topstrut But I want to be informed about\break
the breeches, said my father.

\textit{Albertus Rubenius} informed my father\break
\stick{that the \textit{Romans} manufactured stuffs of} 
\stick{various fabricks,\tsh some plain,\tsk some} 
\stick{striped,\tsk others diapered throughout the}
\stick{whole contexture of the wool, with silk} 
\stick{and gold\tsh That linen did not begin} 
\stick{to be in common use, till towards the}
\stick{declension of the empire, when the \textit{Egyp}-}
\stick{\textit{tians} coming to settle amongst them,} 
brought it into vogue.

\tsh That persons of quality and\break
\stick{fortune distinguished themselves by the} 
\stick{fineness and whiteness of their cloaths;} 
\stick{which colour (next to purple, which}
\stick{was appropriated to the great offices)}
\stick{they most affected and wore on their}\catch{birth} 
\stick{birth-days and public rejoicings.\tsh} 
\stick{That it appeared from the best historians}
\stick{of those times, that they frequently sent}
\stick{their cloaths to the fuller, to be cleaned}
\stick{and whitened;\tsh but that the inferior}
\stick{people, to avoid that expence, generally}
\stick{wore brown cloaths, and of a something}
\stick{coarser texture,\tsk till towards the begin-}
\stick{ning of \textit{Augustus}’s reign, when the slave}
\stick{dressed like his master, and almost every}
\stick{distinction of habiliment was lost, but}
the \textit{Latus Clavus.}

And what was the \textit{Latus Clavus?} said\break
my father.

\textit{Rubenius} told him, that the point was\break
\stick{still litigating amongst the learned:\tsh} 
\stick{That \textit{Egnatius}, \textit{Sigonius}, \textit{Bossius Tici}-}
\stick{\textit{nensis}, \textit{Bayfius}, \textit{Budæus}, \textit{Salmasius}, \textit{Lip}-}
\stick{\textit{sius}, \textit{Lazius}, \textit{Isaac Causonbon}, and \textit{Jo}-}\catch{\textit{seph}} 
\stick{\textit{seph Scaliger}, all differed from each}
\stick{other,\tsk and he from them: That some} 
\stick{took it to be the button,\tsk some the coat} 
\stick{itself,\tsk others only the colour of it:\tsk}
\stick{That the great \textit{Bayfius}, in his Wardrobe}
\stick{of the ancients, chap.\@ 12.\tsk honestly}
\stick{said, he knew not what it was,\tsk whether}
\stick{a tibula,\tsk a stud,\tsk a button,\tsk a loop,\tsk}
a buckle,\tsk or clasps and keepers.\tsh

\tsh My father lost the horse, but not\break
\stick{the saddle\tsh They are \textit{hooks and eyes},}
\stick{said my father\tsh and with hooks and} 
eyes he ordered my breeches to be made.

\dropcap{I}{f} the reader has not a clear concep-\break 
tion of the rood and the half of\break
\stick{ground which lay at the bottom of my} 
\stick{uncle \toby's kitchen-garden, and which}
\stick{was the scene of so many of his delicious}
\stick{hours,\tsk the fault is not in me,\tsk but in} 
\stick{his imagination;\tsk for I am sure I gave}
\stick{him so minute a description, I was al-}
most ashamed of it.

When \textscl{Fate} was looking forwards one\break
\stick{afternoon, into the great transactions of}
\stick{future times,\tsk and recollected for what}
\stick{purposes, this little plot, by a decree}
\stick{fast bound down in iron, had been de-}\catch{stined,} 
\stick{stined,\tsk she gave a nod to \textscl{Nature}\tsk} 
\stick{’twas enough\tsk Nature threw half a spade}
\stick{full of her kindliest compost upon it,}
\stick{with just so \textit{much} clay in it, as to retain}
\stick{the forms of angles and indentings,\tsk}
\stick{and so \textit{little} of it too, as not to cling to} 
\stick{the spade, and render works of so much}
glory, nasty in foul weather.

My uncle \toby came down, as the\break 
\stick{reader has been informed, with plans} 
\stick{along with him, of almost every forti-}
\stick{fied town in \textit{Italy} and \textit{Flanders}; so let}
\stick{the Duke of \textit{Marlborough}, or the allies,} 
\stick{have set down before what town they} 
\stick{pleased, my uncle \toby was prepared for}
them.

His way, which was the simplest one\break
\stick{in the world, was this; as soon as ever}
\stick{a town was invested\tsk (but sooner when}\catch{the} 
\stick{the design was known) to take the plan}
\stick{of it, (let it be what town it would)}
\stick{and enlarge it upon a scale to the exact}
\stick{size of his bowling-green; upon the sur-}
\stick{face of which, by means of a large role} 
\stick{of packthread, and a number of small}
\stick{piquets driven into the ground, at the}
\stick{several angles and redans, he transferred}
\stick{the lines from his paper; then taking}
\stick{the profile of the place, with its works,}
\stick{to determine the depths and slopes of}
\stick{the ditches,\tsk the talus of the glacis,} 
\stick{and the precise height of the several}
\stick{banquets, parapets, \&c.\tsk he set the}
\stick{corporal to work\tsh and sweetly went} 
\stick{it on:\tsh The nature of the soil,\tsk} 
\stick{the nature of the work itself,\tsk and above} 
\stick{all, the good nature of my uncle \toby}
\stick{sitting by from morning to night, and} 
\stick{chatting kindly with the corporal upon}\catch{past-}
\stick{past-done deeds,\tsk left \textscl{labour} little else}
but the ceremony of the name.

When the place was finished in this\break
\stick{manner, and put into a proper posture}
\stick{of defence,\tsk it was invested,\tsk and my}
\stick{uncle \toby and the corporal began to run}
\stick{their first parallel.\tsk I beg I may not}
\stick{be interrupted in my story, by being}
\stick{told, \textit{That the first parallel should be}}
\stick{\textit{at least three hundred toises distant from}}
\stick{\textit{the main body of the place,\tsk and that I}}
\stick{\textit{have not left a single inch for it};\tsh for}
\stick{my uncle \toby took the liberty of in-}
\stick{croaching upon his kitchen garden, for}
\stick{the sake of enlarging his works on the} 
\stick{bowling green, and for that reason ge-}
\stick{nerally ran his first and second parallels}
\stick{betwixt two rows of his cabbages and}
\stick{his collyflowers; the conveniences and}
\stick{inconveniences of which will be consi-}\catch{dered} 
\stick{dered at large in the history of my}
\stick{uncle \toby's and the corporal’s cam-}
\stick{paigns, of which, this I’m now writing}
\stick{is but a sketch, and will be finished, if}
\stick{I conjecture right, in three pages (but}
\stick{there is no guessing)\tsh The campaigns} 
\stick{themselves will take up as many books;} 
\stick{and therefore I apprehend it would be} 
\stick{hanging too great a weight of one kind} 
\stick{of matter in so flimsy a performance as} 
\stick{this, to rhapsodize them, as I once in-}
\stick{tended, into the body of the work\tsh} 
\stick{surely they had better be printed apart,}
\stick{\tsh we’ll consider the affair\tsh so take}
\stick{the following sketch of them in the}

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XXII.}

\dropcap{W}{hen} the town, with its works,\break
was finished, my uncle \textit{Toby}\break
\stick{and the corporal began to run their first}\catch{parallel}
\stick{parallel \tsh not at random, or any how}
\stick{\tsh but from the same points and dis-}
\stick{tances the allies had begun to run theirs;}
\stick{and regulating their approaches and at-}
\stick{tacks, by the accounts my uncle \textit{Toby}}
\stick{received from the daily papers,\tsk they}
\stick{went on, during the whole siege, step} 
by step with the allies.

When the duke of \textit{Marlborough} made\break
\stick{a lodgment,\tsh my uncle \toby made a}
\stick{lodgment too.\tsh And when the face of}
\stick{a bastion was battered down, or a de-}
\stick{fence ruined,\tsk the corporal took his}
\stick{mattock and did as much,\tsk and so on;}
\stick{\tsh gaining ground, and making them-}
\stick{selves masters of the works one after}
\stick{another, till the town fell into their}
hands.\patch{To}

\topstrut To one who took pleasure in the hap-\break
\stick{py state of others,\tsk there could not}
\stick{have been a greater sight in the world,}
\stick{than, on a post-morning, in which a}
\stick{practicable breach had been made by the}
\stick{duke of \textit{Marlborough}, in the main body}
\stick{of the place,\tsk to have stood behind the}
\stick{horn beam hedge, and observed the spi-}
\stick{rit with which my uncle \toby, with}
\stick{\trim behind him, sallied forth;\tsh the} 
\stick{one with the \textit{Gazette} in his hand,\tsk the}
\stick{other with a spade on his shoulder to ex-}
\stick{ecute the contents.\tsh What an honest}
\stick{triumph in my uncle \toby's looks as he}
\stick{marched up to the ramparts! What in-}
\stick{tense pleasure swimming in his eye as he}
\stick{stood over the corporal, reading the pa-}
\stick{ragraph ten times over to him, as he was}
\stick{at work, lest, peradventure, he should} 
\stick{make the breach an inch too wide,\tsk or}\catch{leave} 
\stick{leave it an inch too narrow\tsh But}
\stick{when the \textit{chamade} was beat, and the cor-}
\stick{poral helped my uncle up it, and fol-}
\stick{lowed with the colours in his hand, to}
\stick{fix them upon the ramparts\tsk Heaven!}
\stick{Earth!  Sea!\tsh but what avails apos-}
\stick{trophes?\tsh with all your elements,}
\stick{wet or dry, ye never compounded so in-}
toxicating a draught.

In this track of happiness for many\break
\stick{years, without one interruption to it,}
\stick{except now and then when the wind}
\stick{continued to blow due west for a week} 
\stick{or ten days together, which detained the}
\stick{\textit{Flanders} mail, and kept them so long in}
\stick{torture,\tsk but still ’twas the torture of} 
\stick{the happy\tsh In this track, I say, did}
\stick{my uncle \toby and \trim move for many} 
\stick{years, every year of which, and some-}
\stick{times every month, from the invention}\catch{of} 
\stick{of either the one or the other of them,} 
\stick{adding some new conceit or quirk of}
\stick{improvement to their operations, which} 
\stick{always opened fresh springs of delight}
in carrying them on.

The first year’s campaign was carried\break
\stick{on from beginning to end, in the plain}
and simple method I’ve related.

In the second year, in which my un-\break
\stick{cle \toby took \textit{Liege} and \textit{Ruremond}, he}
\stick{thought he might afford the expence of} 
\stick{four handsome draw-bridges, two of} 
\stick{which I have given an exact description,}
in the former part of my work.

At the latter end of the same year\break
\stick{he added a couple of gates with port-}
\stick{cullises:\tsh These last were converted}
\stick{afterwards in orgues, as the better thing;}\catch{and} 
\stick{and during the winter of the same year,}
\stick{my uncle \toby, instead of a new suit of} 
\stick{cloaths, which he always had at \textit{Christ}-}
\stick{\textit{mas}, treated himself with a handsome}
\stick{sentry-box, to stand at the corner of the}
\stick{bowling-green, betwixt which point and}
\stick{the foot of the glacis, there was left a}
\stick{little kind of an esplanade for him and}
\stick{the corporal to confer and hold councils}
of war upon.

\tsh The sentry-box was in case of\break
rain.

All these were painted white three\break
\stick{times over the ensuing spring, which}
\stick{enabled my uncle \toby to take the field}
with great splendour.

My father would often say to \textit{Yorick},\break
\stick{that if any mortal in the whole universe}\catch{had} 
\stick{had done such a thing, except his bro-}
\stick{ther \toby, it would have been looked}
\stick{upon by the world as one of the most}
\stck{refined satyrs upon the parade and pranc-}
\stick{ing manner, in which \textit{Lewis} XIV.\@ from}
\stick{the beginning of the war, but particu-}
\stick{larly that very year, had taken the field}
\stick{\tsh But ’tis not my brother \toby's na-}
\stick{ture, kind soul!\@ my father would add,}
to insult any one.

\tsh But let us go on.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XXIII.}

\initial{I}{Must} observe, that although in the\break
first year’s campaign, the word \textit{town}\break
\stick{is often mentioned,\tsk yet there was no}
\stick{town at that time within the polygon;}
\stick{that addition was not made till the sum-}
\stick{mer following the spring in which the} 
\stick{bridges and sentry-box were painted,}\catch{which}
\stick{which was the third year of my uncle}
\stick{\toby's campaigns,\tsk when upon his tak-}
\stick{ing \textit{Amberg}, \textit{Bonn}, and \textit{Rhinberg}, and} 
\stick{\textit{Huy} and \textit{Limbourg}, one after another,} 
\stick{a thought came into the corporal’s head,} 
\stick{that to talk of taking so many towns,}
\stick{\textit{without one} \textsc{town} \textit{to show for it},\tsk was a} 
\stick{very nonsensical way of going to work,} 
\stick{and so proposed to my uncle \toby, that} 
\stick{they should have a little model of a} 
\stick{town built for them,\tsk to be run up to-}
\stick{gether of slit deals, and then painted,} 
\stick{and clapped within the interior polygon} 
to serve for all.

My uncle \toby felt the good of the\break
\stick{project instantly, and instantly agreed to}
\stick{it, but with the addition of two sin-}
\stick{gular improvements, of which he was} 
\stick{almost as proud, as if he had been the}
original inventor of the project itself.\patch{The}

\topstrut The one was to have the town built\break
\stick{exactly in the style of those, of which it}
\stick{was most likely to be the representative:}
\stick{\tsh with grated windows, and the} 
\stick{gable ends of the houses, facing the} 
\stick{streets, \&c. \&c.\tsk as those in \textit{Ghent} and}
\stick{\textit{Bruges}, and the rest of the towns in}
\textit{Brabant} and \textit{Flanders}.

The other was, not to have the houses\break
\stick{run up together, as the corporal propos-}
\stick{ed, but to have every house indepen-}
\stick{dant, to hook on, or off, so as form}
\stick{into the plan of whatever town they} 
\stick{pleased. This was put directly into} 
\stick{hand, and many and many a look of}
\stick{mutual congratulation was exchanged} 
\stick{between my uncle \toby and the corpo-}
ral, as the carpenter did the work.\patch{\tsh It}

\tsh\topstrut It answered prodigiously the next
\stick{summer\tsh the town was a perfect \textit{Pro}-}
\stick{\textit{teus}\tsh It was \textit{Landen}, and \textit{Trerebach},} 
\stick{and \textit{Santvliet}, and \textit{Drusen}, and \textit{Hagenau},}
\stick{\tsk and then it was \textit{Ostend} and \textit{Menin}, and} 
\textit{Aeth} and \textit{Dendermond}.\tsh

\tsh Surely never did any \textscl{town} act\break
\stick{so many parts, since \textit{Sodom} and \textit{Gomor}-}
\textit{rah}, as my uncle \toby's town did.

In the fourth year, my uncle \toby\break
\stick{thinking a town looked foolishly with-}
\stick{out a church, added a very fine one}
\stick{with a steeple.\tsh \trim was for having}
\stick{bells in it;\tsh my uncle \toby said, the}
mettle had better be cast into cannon.

\tight{This led the way the next campaign for}\break
\stick{half a dozen brass field pieces,\tsk to be}\catch{planted} 
\stck{planted three and three on each side of my}
\stick{uncle \toby's sentry-box; and in a short}
\stck{time, these led the way for a train of some-}
\stick{what larger,\tsk and so on\tsk (as must al-}
\stck{ways be the case in hobby-horsical affairs)}
\stick{from pieces of half an inch bore, till it} 
came at last to my father’s jack boots.

The next year, which was that in\break
\stick{which \textit{Lisle} was besieged, and at the}
\stick{close of which both \textit{Ghent} and \textit{Bruges}}
\stick{fell into our hands,\tsk my uncle \toby was}
\stick{sadly put to it for \textit{proper} ammunition;}
\stick{\tsh I say proper ammunition\tsh be-}
\stick{cause his great artillery would not bear} 
\stick{powder; and ’twas well for the \textit{Shandy}}
\stick{family they would not\tsh For so full} 
\stick{were the papers, from the beginning to} 
\stick{the end of the siege, of the incessant}
\stick{firings kept up by the besiegers,\tsh and} 
\stick{so heated was my uncle \toby's imagina-}\catch{tion} 
\stick{tion with the accounts of them, that he}
had infallibly shot away all his estate.

\textscl{Something} therefore was wanting,\break
\stick{as a \textit{succedaneum}, especially in one or} 
\stick{two of the more violent paroxysms of} 
\stick{the siege, to keep up something like a}
\stick{continual firing in the imagination,\tsh}
\stick{and this \textit{something}, the corporal, whose} 
\stick{principal strength lay in invention, sup-}
\stick{plied by an entire new system of batter-}
\stick{ing of his own,\tsk without which, this}
\stick{had been objected to by military critics,}
\stick{to the end of the world, as one of the}
\stick{great \textit{desiderata} of my uncle \toby's ap-}
paratus.

This will not be explained the worse,\break
\stick{for setting off, as I generally do, at a}
little distance from the subject.

\topstrut My father, who saw all things in\break

\dropcap{T}{he} corporal, who the night be-\break

\stick{supply the grand \textit{desideratum}, of keeping}
\stick{up something like an incessant firing} 
\stick{upon the enemy during the heat of the} 
\stick{attack,\tsk had no further idea in his fancy} 
\stick{at that time, than a contrivance of smoak-}
\stick{ing tobacco against the town, out of}
\stick{one of my uncle \toby's six field pieces,}
\stick{which were planted on each side of his}
\stick{sentry-box; the means of effecting which}

\stick{thought it in no danger from the miscar-}
riage of his projects.

Upon turning it this way, and that,\break
\stick{a little in his mind, he soon began to} 
\stick{find out, that by means of his two \textit{Tur}-}
\stick{\textit{kish} tobacco-pipes, with the supplement}
\stick{of three smaller tubes of wash-leather at}
\stick{each of their lower ends, to be tagg’d}

to fire one.\tsh

\stick{Let no man, who has read my father’s}

No matter for that, \textit{Eugenius}; I would\break

\stick{Think ye not that in striking these \textit{in},\tsk}
\stick{he might, peradventure, strike something} 
\textit{out?} as sure as a gun.\tsh

\tsh But this project, by the bye.

The corporal sat up the best part of\break

ten minutes before my uncle \toby,\break

He had drawn the six field-pieces for\break

\stick{only an interval of about a yard and a}

\stick{playing off his two cross batteries at the}

\stick{which faced the counterscarp, where the}
\stick{attack was to be made that morning.}
\stick{His first intention, as I said, was no}

Vain science! thou assists us in no

There was, Madam, in my uncle\break

\stick{read an article of news extracted out of} 
\stick{the \textit{Utrecht Gazette}, without fetching a}

\stick{grieved for nothing in the whole affair,}

\stick{themselves, cannot keep us out of play.}
\stick{\tsh I defy ’em, my dear \toby, he would}
\stick{add, to take countries without taking} 
towns,\tsh or towns without sieges.

My uncle \toby never took this back-\break
\stick{stroke of my father’s at his hobby horse} 
\stick{kindly.\tsh He thought the stroke unge-}
\stick{nerous; and the more so, because in} 
\stick{striking the horse, he hit the rider too,}
\stick{and in the most dishonourable part a} 
\stick{blow could fall; so that upon these oc-}
\stick{casions, he always laid down his pipe} 
\stick{upon the table with more fire to defend} 
himself than common.

I told the reader, this time two years,\break
\stick{that my uncle \toby was not eloquent;} 
\stick{and in the very same page gave an in-}
\stick{stance to the contrary:\tsh I repeat the}
\stick{observation, and a fact which contradicts}\catch{it} 
\stick{it again.\tsk He was not eloquent,\tsk it was} 
\stick{not easy to my uncle \toby to make long}

\stck{but there were occasions where the stream} 
\stick{overflowed the man, and ran so counter}

\stick{evening before him and \textit{Yorick}, that he}
wrote it down before he went to bed.

\centerline{\textit{My  uncle} \textscl{Toby}’\textit{s apologetical  oration}.}

\initial{I}{Am} not insensible, brother \textit{Shandy},\break
that when a man, whose profession\break
\stick{is arms, wishes, as I have done, for}
\stick{war,\tsk it has an ill aspect to the world;}
\stick{\tsh and that, how just and right soever}
\stick{his motives and intentions may be,\tsk he}
\stck{stands in an uneasy posture in vindicating}
\stick{himself from private views in doing it.\hfill}\catch{For}

\topstrut For this cause, if a soldier is a prudent\break
\stick{man, which he may be, without being} 
\stick{a jot the less brave, he will be sure not} 
\stick{to utter his wish in the hearing of an} 
\stick{enemy; for say what he will, an enemy}
\stick{will not believe him.\tsh He will be}
\stick{cautious of doing it even to a friend,\tsk}
\stick{lest he may suffer in his esteem:\tsh But}
\stick{if his heart is overcharged, and a secret}
\stick{sigh for arms must have its vent, he}
\stick{will reserve it for the ear of a brother,} 
\stick{who knows his character to the bottom,} 
\stick{and what his true notions, dispositions,}
\stick{and principles of honour are: What, I} 
\stick{\textit{hope}, I have been in all these, brother}
\stick{\textit{Shandy}, would be unbecoming in me to} 
\stick{say:\tsh much worse, I know, have I} 
\stick{been than I ought,\tsk and something} 
\stick{worse, perhaps, than I think: But such}
\stick{as I am, you, my dear brother \textit{Shandy},}
\stick{who have sucked the same breasts with} 
\stick{me,\tsk and with whom I have been}\catch{brought}
\stick{brought up from my cradle,\tsk and from}
\stick{whose knowledge, from the first hours of} 
\stick{our boyish pastimes, down to this, I} 
\stick{have concealed no one action of my life,}
\stick{and scarce a thought in it\tsh Such as I} 
\stick{am, brother, you must by this time}
\stick{know me, with all my vices, and with} 
\stick{all my weaknesses too, whether of my} 
\stick{age, my temper, my passions, or my} 
understanding.

Tell me then, my dear brother \textit{Shandy},\break
\stick{upon which of them it is, that when I} 
\stick{condemned the peace of \textit{Utrecht}, and}
\stick{grieved the war was not carried on with} 
\stick{vigour a little longer, you should think}
\stick{your brother did it upon unworthy}
\stick{views; or that in wishing for war, he} 
\stick{should be bad enough to wish more of} 
\stick{his fellow creatures slain,\tsk more slaves}
\stick{made, and more families driven from} 
\stick{their peaceful habitations, merely for his}
\stick{own pleasure:\tsh Tell me, brother}\catch{\textit{Shandy},} 
\stick{\textit{Shandy}, upon what one deed of mine do} 
\stick{you ground it? [\textit{The devil a deed do I}}
\stick{\textit{know of, dear} Toby, \textit{but one for a hun}-}
\stick{\textit{dred pounds, which I lent thee to carry on}}
\textit{these cursed sieges.}]

If, when I was a school-boy, I could\break
\stick{not hear a drum beat, but my heart beat} 
\stick{with it\tsk was it my fault?\tsh Did I}
\stick{plant the propensity there?\tsh did I} 
sound the alarm within, or Nature?

When \textit{Guy}, Earl of \textit{Warwick}, and\break
\stick{\textit{Parismus} and \textit{Parismenus}, and \textit{Valentine}}
\stick{and \textit{Orson}, and the \textit{Seven Champions of}}
\stick{\textit{England}, were handed around the school,}
\stick{\tsk were they not all purchased with my}
\stick{own pocket money? Was that selfish,} 
\stick{brother \textit{Shandy?} When we read over the}
\stick{siege of \textit{Troy}, which lasted ten years} 
\stick{and eight months,\tsh though with such} 
\stick{a train of artillery as we had at \textit{Namur},} 
\stick{the town might have been carried in a}\catch{week}
\stick{week\tsk was I not as much concerned for} 
\stick{the destruction of the \textit{Greeks} and \textit{Trojans}} 
\stick{as any boy of the whole school? Had I}
\stick{not three strokes of a ferula given me,}
\stick{two on my right hand and one on my} 
\stick{left, for calling \textit{Helena} a bitch for it?} 
\stick{Did any one of you shed more tears for} 
\stick{\textit{Hector?} And when king \textit{Priam} came to}
\stick{the camp to beg his body, and returned}
\stick{weeping back to \textit{Troy} without it,\tsk you} 
\stick{know, brother, I could not eat my}
dinner.\tsh

\tsh Did that bespeak me cruel? Or\break
\stick{because, brother \textit{Shandy}, my blood flew}
\stick{out into the camp, and my heart panted}
\stick{for war,\tsk was it a proof it could not}
ache for the distresses of war too?

O brother! ’tis one thing for a sol-\break
\stick{dier to gather laurels,\tsk and ’tis another}
\stick{to scatter cypress.\tsk [\textit{Who told thee},}\catch{\textit{my}}

\initial[nindent=0pt]{I}{Told} \tight{the Christian reader in the be-}\break
\tight{ginning of the chapter which preceded}\break
\stick{my uncle \toby's apologetical oration,\tsk}
\stick{though in a different trope from what}
\stick{I should make use of now, That the peace} 
\stick{of \textit{Utrecht} was within an ace of creating}
\stick{the same shyness betwixt my uncle \toby} 
\stick{and his hobby-horse, as it did betwixt} 
\stick{the queen and the rest of the confede-}
rating powers.

There is an indignant way in which a\break
\stick{man sometimes dismounts his horse,}
\stick{which as good as says to him, \lqq I’ll go}
\stick{\lqq afoot, Sir, all the days of my life,}
\stick{\lqq before I would ride a single mile upon}
\stick{\lqq your back again.” Now my uncle}
\stick{\toby could not be said to dismount his}
\stick{horse in this manner; for in strictness of}
\stick{language, he could not be said to dis-}\catch{mount}
\stick{mount his horse at all\tsh his horse ra-}
\stick{ther flung him\tsh and somewhat \textit{vi}-}
\stick{\textit{ciously}, which made my uncle \toby take}
\stick{it ten times more unkindly. Let this}
\stick{matter be settled by state jockies as they}
\stick{like.\tsh It created, I say, a sort of shy-}
\stick{ness betwixt my uncle \toby and his} 
\stick{hobby-horse.\tsh He had no occasion}
\stick{for him from the month of \textit{March} to}
\stick{\textit{November}, which was the summer after}
\stick{the articles were signed, except it was}
\stick{now and then to take a short ride out,}
\stick{just to see that the fortifications and har-}
\stick{bour of \textit{Dunkirk} were demolished, ac-}
cording to stipulation.

The \textit{French} were so backwards all that\break
\stick{summer in setting about that affair, and}
\stick{Monsieur \textit{Tugghe}, the deputy from the}
\stck{magistrates of \textit{Dunkirk}, presented so many}
\stck{affecting petitions to the queen,\tsk beseech-}
\stck{ing her majesty to cause only her thunder-}
\stck{bolts to fall upon the martial works, which}\catch{might}

\stick{but to spare\tsk to spare the mole, for the} 
\stick{mole’s sake; which, in its naked situa-}
\stick{tion, could be no more than an object} 
\stick{of pity\tsh and the queen (who was}
\stick{but a woman) being of a pitiful dispo-}

\stick{wishing in their hearts to have the town}

The corporal was for beginning the\break

\stick{ramparts, or main fortifications of the}
\stick{town\tsh No,\tsk that will never do, cor-}

\stick{\tsh ’tis no part of the consideration of}
\stick{a commandant, what the enemy dare,\tsk}

it\tsh

\tsh Or by a more critical equation,\break
