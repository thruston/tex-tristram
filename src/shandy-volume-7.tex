\stick{kept a going at that rate these forty years} 
\stick{if it pleased but the fountain of life to}
\stick{bless me so long with health and good}

\stick{seest he has got me by the throat (for}
\stick{Eugenius could scarce hear me speak}
\stick{across the table), and that I am no match} 
\stick{for him in the open field, had I not better,} 
\stick{whilst these few scatter’d spirits remain,} 
\stick{and these two spider legs of mine\sic holding}
\stck{one of them up to him) are able to support} 
\stick{me\tsk had I not better, Eugenius, fly for} 
\stck{my life? ’tis my advice, my dear Tristram,} 
\stck{said Eugenius\tshh then by heaven! I will}
\stick{lead him a dance he little thinks of\tsk} 
\stick{for I will gallop, quoth I, without look-}

\dropcap{I}{t} is a great inconvenience to a man\break
in a haste, that there are three distinct\break

\stick{of which there is so much to be said by} 
\stck{the several deputies from the towns which}
\stick{lie along them, that half a day is easily}
lost in settling which you’ll take.

First, the road by Lisle and Arras,\break
\stick{which is the most about\tsh but most in-}
teresting, and instructing.

The second that by Amiens, which\break
\stick{you may go, if you would see Chan-}
tilly\tsh

And that by Beauvais, which you\break
may go, if you will.
\natch[12pt]{For}

\dropcap{C}{alais}, \i{Calatium}, \i{Calusium},\break
\i{Calesium}.

This town, if we may trust it's\sic\ ar-\break
\stick{chives, the authority of which I see no} 
\stick{reason to call in question in this place\tsk}
\stick{was \i{once} no more than a small village be-}
\stick{longing to one of the first Counts de} 
\stick{Guines; and as it boasts at present of no}
\stick{less than fourteen thousand inhabitants,}
\stick{exclusive of four hundred and twenty}
\stick{distinct families in the \i{basse ville}, or sub-}
\stick{urbs\tsh it must have grown up by little} 
and little, I suppose, to it's\sic\ present size.
\natch[10pt]{Though}

Though there are four convents, there\break
\stick{is but one parochial church in the whole}
\stick{town; I had not an opportunity of taking}
\stick{its exact dimensions, but it is pretty easy} 
\stick{to make a tolerable conjecture of ’em\tsk}
\stck{for as there are fourteen thousand inhabi-}
\stick{tants in the town, if the church holds} 
\stick{them all, it must be considerably large\tsk}
\stick{and if it will not\tsk ’tis a very great pity} 
\stick{they have not another\tsk it is built in form} 
\stick{of a cross, and dedicated to the Virgin}
\stick{Mary; the steeple which has a spire to}
\stick{it, is placed in the middle of the church,} 
\stick{and stands upon four pillars elegant and}
\stick{light enough, but sufficiently strong at}
\stck{the same time\tsk it is decorated with eleven}
\stick{altars, most of which are rather fine than}
\stick{beautiful. The great altar is a master-}
\stick{piece in its kind; ’tis of white marble,} 
\stick{and as I was told near sixty feet high\tsk}
\catch{had}
\stick{had it been much higher, it had been as}
\stick{high as mount Calvary itself\tsk therefore,} 
\stick{I suppose it must be high enough in all}
conscience.

There was nothing struck me more\break
\stick{than the great \i{Square}; tho’ I cannot say}
\stck{’tis either well paved or well built; but ’tis}
\stick{in the heart of the town, and most of the}
\stick{streets, especially those in that quarter,} 
\stick{all terminate in it; could there have been}
\stick{a fountain in all Calais, which it seems} 
\stick{there cannot, as such an object would}
\stick{have been a great ornament, it is not to be} 
\stick{doubted, but that the inhabitants would}
\stick{have had it in the very centre of this} 
\stick{square,\tsk not that it is properly a square,}
\stick{\tsk because ’tis forty feet longer from east}
\stick{to west, than from north to south; so}
\stick{that the French in general have more}
\catch{reason}  % Sig C.
\baselineskip 13.6667pt
\stick{reason on their side in calling them} 
\stick{\i{Places} than \i{Squares}, which, strictly speak-}
ing, to be sure they are not.

\tight{The town-house seems to be but a sorry}\break
\stick{building, and not to be kept in the best}
\stick{repair; otherwise it had been a second} 
\stick{great ornament to this place; it answers}
\stick{however its destination, and serves very} 
\stick{well for the reception of the magistrates,}
\stick{who assemble in it from time to time; so} 
\stick{that ’tis presumable, justice is regularly} 
distributed.

I have heard much of it, but there is\break
\stick{nothing at all curious in the \i{Courgain};} 
\stick{’tis a distinct quarter of the town, inhabi-}
\stick{ted solely by sailors and fishermen; it} 
\stick{consists of a number of small streets,}
\stick{neatly built and mostly of brick; ’tis}
\catch{extremely}
\stick{extremely populous, but as that may be} 
\stick{accounted for, from the principles of} 
\stick{their diet,\tsk there is nothing curious in}
\stick{that neither.\tsh A traveller may see it to} 
\stick{satisfy himself\tsk he must not omit how-}
\stick{ever taking notice of \i{La Tour de Guet},}
\stick{upon any account; ’tis so called from its}
\stick{particular destination, because in war it} 
\stick{serves to discover and give notice of the}
\stick{enemies which approach the place, either}
\stick{by sea or land;\tsh but ’tis monstrous} 
\stick{high, and catches the eye so continually,}
\stick{you cannot avoid taking notice of it, if} 
you would.

\tight{It was a singular disappointment to me,}\break
\stick{that I could not have permission to take}
\stick{an exact survey of the fortifications,}
\stick{which are the strongest in the world, and}
\catch{which,} 
\stick{which, from first to last, that is, from the} 
\stick{time they were set about by Philip of} 
\stick{France Count of Bologne, to the present}
\stick{war, wherein many reparations were} 
\stick{made, have cost (as I learned afterwards}
\stick{from an engineer in Gascony)\tsk above} 
\stick{a hundred millions of livres. It is}
\stick{very remarkable that at the \i{Tête de Gra}-}
\stick{\i{velenes}, and where the town is naturally}
\stick{the weakest, they have expended the} 
\stck{most money; so that the outworks stretch}
\stick{a great way into the campaign, and con-}
\stick{sequently occupy a large tract of ground.}
\stick{\tsk However, after all that is \i{said} and \i{done},} 
\stick{it must be acknowledged that Calais was}
\stick{never upon any account so considerable}
\stick{from itself, as from its situation, and that} 
\stick{easy enterance which it gave our ances-}
\stick{tors upon all occasions into France:} 
\stick{it was not without its inconveniences}
\catch{also;} 
\stick{also; being no less troublesome to the}
\stick{English in those times, than Dunkirk}
\stick{has been to us, in ours; so that it was}
\stick{deservedly looked upon as the key to} 
\stick{both kingdoms, which no doubt is the}
\stick{reason that there have arisen so many} 
\stick{contentions who should keep it: of these,} 
\stick{the siege of Calais, or rather the block-}
\stick{ade (for it was shut up both by land and}
\stick{sea) was the most memorable, as it with-}
\stick{stood the efforts of Edward the third}
\stick{a whole year, and was not terminated} 
\stick{at last but by famine and extream mi-}
\stick{sery; the gallantry of \i{Eustace de St.}}
\stick{\i{Pierre}, who first offered himself a vic-}

\stick{fifth, to the sixth, seventh, eighth,}
\stick{ninth, and tenth time, and without one} 
\stick{exception, I then could not avoid making} 
\stick{a national reflection of it, which I do in}
these words;

\i{That something is always wrong in a}\break
\i{French post-chaise upon first setting out}.

\noindent\stick{\indent Or the proposition may stand thus.}

\i{A French postilion has always to alight}
\catch{\i{before}} 
\stick{\i{before he has got three hundred yards out}}
\i{of town}.

What’s wrong now?\tsk Diable!\tsk\break
\stick{a rope’s broke!\tsk a knot has slipt!}
\stick{\tsk a staple’s drawn!\tsk a bolt’s to} 
\stick{whittle!\tsk a tag, a rag, a jag, a}
\stick{strap, a buckle, or a buckle’s tongue,} 
want altering.\tsh

Now true as all this is, I never think\break 
\stick{myself impower’d to excommunicate}
\stick{thereupon either the post-chaise, or its}
\stick{driver\tsh nor do I take it into my head}
\stick{to swear by the living G\tsk, I would rather}
\stick{go a foot ten thousand times\tshh or}
\stick{that I will be damn’d if ever I get into}
\stick{another\tsh but I take the matter coolly}
\stick{before me, and consider, that some tag, or}
\catch{rag,}
\stick{rag, or jag, or bolt, or buckle, or buckle’s} 
\stick{tongue, will ever be a wanting, or want}
\stick{altering, travel where I will\tsk so}
\stick{I never chaff, but take the good}
\stick{and the bad as they fall in my road,}
\stick{and get on:\tsh Do so, my lad! said} 
\stick{I; he had lost five minutes already,} 
\stick{in alighting in order to get at a lunch-}
\stick{eon of black bread which he had cramm’d}
\stick{into the chaise-pocket, and was re-}
\stick{mounted and going leisurely on, to} 
\stick{relish it the better\tsh Get on, my lad,}
\stick{said I, briskly\tsk but in the most persua-}
\stick{sive tone imaginable, for I jingled a} 
\stick{four and twenty sous piece against the}
\stick{glass, taking care to hold the flat side}
\stick{towards him, as he look’d back: the} 
\stick{dog grinn’d intelligence from his right}
\stick{ear to his left, and behind his sooty}
\catch{muzzle}
\stick{muzzle discover’d such a pearly row} 
\stick{of teeth, that \i{Sovereignty} would have}
pawn’d her jewels for them.\tsh

Just heaven! $\Big\{\vcenter{\halign{\,#\hss\cr What masticators!\tsh\cr What bread!\tsh\cr}}$

\stick{own, it does not look so well in the book}

see it\tsk to be sure it looks most pitifully.

There is one thing however in it at\break
\stick{present very handsome; and that is the}
\stick{inn-keeper’s daughter: She has been} 
\stick{eighteen months at Amiens, and six at}
\stick{Paris, in going through her classes; so}
\stick{knits, and sews, and dances, and does} 
the little coquetries very well.\tsh

\stck{which David prophetically foresaw would}

\stick{ever: for in my \i{grand tour} through Eu-}

\stick{have found fruit even in a desert\tsh he}
\stick{has left me enough to say upon \s{Aux}-}

\stick{went\tsk but ’twas more remarkably}

\catch{in} 
\stick{in such strange lights\tsh and his remarks}
\stick{and reasonings upon the characters, the}

\stick{we pass’d over, were so opposite to those} 
\stick{of all other mortal men, particularly}
\stick{those of my uncle Toby and Trim\tsk} 
\stick{(to say nothing of myself)\tsk and to crown} 
\stick{all\tsk the occurrences and scrapes which}
\stick{we were perpetually meeting and getting} 
\stick{into, in consequence of his systems and}

\stick{which comes to the same point\tsk till the}

\tshh But this rich bale is not to be\break
\stick{open’d now; except a small thread or} 
\stick{two of it, merely to unravel the mystery}
of my father’s stay at \s{Auxerre}.

\tsh As I have mentioned it\tsk ’tis too\break
\stick{slight to be kept suspended; and when} 
’tis wove in, there’s an end of it.

We’ll go, brother Toby, said my fa-\break
\stick{ther, whilst dinner is coddling\tsk to the}
\stick{abby of Saint Germain, if it be only to}
\stick{see these bodies, of which Monsieur Se-}
\stick{quier has given such a recommendation.}
\stick{\tshh I’ll go see any body; quoth my} 
\stick{uncle Toby; for he was all compliance}
\stick{thro’ every step of the journey\tsh De-}
\catch{fend} 
\stick{fend me! said my father\tsk they are all}
\stick{mummies\tsh Then one need not shave;}
\stick{quoth my uncle Toby\tsh Shave!  no\tsk}
\stick{cried my father\tsk ’twill be more like rela-}
\stick{tions to go with our beards on\tsk So out}
\stck{we sallied, the corporal lending his master} 
\stick{his arm, and bringing up the rear, to the} 
abby of Saint Germain.

Every thing is very fine, and very rich,\break
\stick{and very superb, and very magnificent,}
\stick{said my father, addressing himself to the}
\stick{sacristan, who was a young brother of}
\stick{the order of Benedictines\tsk but our curi-}
\stick{osity has led us to see the bodies, of} 
\stick{which monsieur Sequier has given the}
\stick{world so exact a description.\tsk The sa-} 
\stick{cristan made a bow, and lighting a torch}
\stick{first, which he had always in the vestry}
\stick{ready for the purpose; he led us into the}
\catch{tomb}
\stick{tomb of St.\@ Heribald\tsh This, said the} 
\stick{sacristan, laying his hand upon the tomb,}
\stick{was a renowned prince of the house of}
\stick{Bavaria, who under the successive reigns}
\stick{of Charlemagne, Louis le Debonair,}
\stick{and Charles the Bald, bore a great sway} 
\stick{in the government, and had a principal} 
\stick{hand in bringing every thing into order}
and discipline\tsh

Then he has been as great, said my\break
\stick{uncle, in the field, as in the cabinet\tsk}
\stick{I~dare say he has been a gallant soldier}
\tsh He was a monk\tsk said the sacristan.

My uncle Toby and Trim sought\break
\stick{comfort in each other’s faces\tsk but found}
\stick{it not: my father clapp’d both his hands} 
\stick{upon his cod-piece, which was a way he} 
\stick{had when any thing hugely tickled}
\catch{him;} % sig K.
\baselineskip 13.5pt
\stick{him; for though he hated a monk and} 
\stick{the very smell of a monk worse than all}
\stick{the devils in hell\tsh Yet the shot hitting}
\stick{my uncle Toby and Trim so much} 
\stck{harder than him, ’twas a relative triumph;} 
\stick{and put him into the gayest humour in}
the world.

\tsh And pray what do you call this\break
\stick{gentleman? quoth my father, rather}
\stick{sportingly: This tomb, said the young}
\stick{Benedictine, looking downwards, con-}
\stick{tains the bones of Saint \s{Maxima}, who}
\stick{came from Ravenna on purpose to touch} 
the body\tsh

\tsh Of Saint \s{Maximus}, said my fa-\break
\stick{ther, popping in with his saint before him}
\stick{\tsk they were two of the greatest saints in}
\stick{the whole martyrology, added my father}
\catch{\tsh Excuse} 
\stick{\tshh Excuse me, said the sacristan\tshh}
\stick{\tshh ’twas to touch the bones of Saint} 
\stick{Germain the builder of the abby\tshh} 
\stck{And what did she get by it? said my uncle}
\stick{Toby\tsh What does any woman get by}
\stick{it? said my father\tsh \s{Martyrdome};}
\stick{replied the young Benedictine, making a}
\stick{bow down to the ground, and uttering}
\stick{the word with so humble, but decisive a} 
\stick{cadence, it disarmed my father for a mo-}
\stck{ment. ’Tis supposed, continued the Bene-}
\stick{dictine, that St.\@ Maxima has lain in this}
\stick{tomb four hundred years, and two hun-}
\stick{dred before her canonization\tsh ’Tis but}
\stick{a slow rise, brother Toby, quoth my}
\stick{father, in this self same army of martyrs.}
\stick{\tsk A desperate slow one, an’ please}

Toby, said my father.

\tshh Poor St.\@ Maxima! said my\break

\stick{from her tomb: She was one of the} 
\stick{fairest and most beautiful ladies either of}

\stick{\tshh But who the duce has got lain down}

\stick{walked on\tsk It is Saint \i{Optat}, Sir, an-}
\stick{swered the sacristan\tsk And properly is}
\stick{Saint Optat plac’d!\@ said my father: And}

\natch[10pt]{\tsh I}

\tsh I thought so, by heaven! cried\break
\stick{my father, interrupting him\tsk Saint}
\stick{Optat!\tsh how should Saint \i{Optat} fail?}
\stck{so snatching out his pocket-book, and the}
\stick{young Benedictine holding him the torch} 
\stick{as he wrote, he set it down as a new prop}
\stick{to his system of christian names, and I}
\stick{will be bold to say, so disinterested was}
\stick{he in the search of truth, that had he}
\stick{found a treasure in St.\@ Optat’s tomb,} 
\stick{it would not have made him half so rich:}
\stick{’Twas as successful a short visit as ever}
\stick{was paid to the dead; and so highly was}
\stick{his fancy pleas’d with all that had passed}
\stick{in it,\tsk that he determined at once to}
stay another day in Auxerre.

\stick{\indent\tsk I’ll see the rest of these good gentry}

\stick{such a kind of empire had it establish’d}

\stick{I fear with some irreverence\tshh \lqq\thinspace I}
\stick{thought this shrine (neglected as it was)}

It was a commissary sent to me from\break

\dropcap[findent=0pt]{A}{nd} now for Lippius’s clock! said\break
I, with the air of a man, who had\break
\stick{got thro’ all his difficulties\tsh nothing} 
\stick{can prevent us seeing that, and the}

\stick{said François\tsk for ’tis almost eleven}
\stick{\tsk then we must speed the faster, said I,}
striding it away to the cathedral.

I cannot say, in my heart, that it gave\break
\stick{me any concern in being told by one of} 
\stick{the minor canons, as I was entering the} 
\stick{west door,\tsk That Lippius’s great clock} 
\stick{was all out of joints, and had not gone} 
\stick{for some years\tshh It will give me the} 
\stick{more time, thought I, to peruse the Chi-}

\stick{to give the world a better account of the}
\catch{clock} 
\stick{clock in it’s\sic\ decay, than I could have}
done in its flourishing condition\tsh

\tsh And so away I posted to the\break
college of the Jesuits.

Now it is with the project of getting a\break
\stick{peep at the history of China in Chinese}
\stick{characters\tsk as with many others I could}
\stick{mention, which strike the fancy only at a}

\stick{gradually went off, till, at length I would} 
\stick{not have given a cherry-stone to have it} 
\stick{gratified\tshh The truth was, my time} 
\stick{was short, and my heart was at the Tomb}
\stick{of the Lovers\tshh I wish to God, said I,}
\stick{as I got the rapper in my hand, that the}

\stick{you will see me crossing the bridge upon}

\stick{mined to make him a present of them,} 
\stick{when we got to the end of our journey,}
\stick{for the trouble they had put him to, of}
arming himself at all points against them.

Before I go further, let me get rid of\break
\stick{my remark upon Avignon, which is this;}
\stick{That I think it wrong, merely because a}
\stick{man’s hat has been blown off his head by}
\stick{chance the first night he comes to Avig-}
\stick{nion\sic,\tsk\!\tsk that he should therefore say,}
\stick{\lqq Avignion\sic\ is more subject to high}
\stick{winds than any town in all France:” for}
\stick{which reason I laid no stress upon the ac-}
\stick{cident till I had enquired of the master of}
\stick{the inn about it, who telling me seriously}
\stick{it was so\tsh and hearing moreover, the}
\stick{windyness of Avignion\sic\ spoke of in the}

\stick{Counts, there\tsh the duce a Baron, in}
\stick{all Avignion\sic\!\!\tsh so that there is scarce}
any talking to them, on a windy day.

Prithee friend, said I, take hold of my\break
\stick{mule for a moment\tsh for I wanted to}
\stick{pull off one of my jack-boots, which}
\stick{hurt my heel\tsk the man was standing}
\stick{quite idle at the door of the inn, and as I}

\stick{I put the bridle into his hand\tsk so be-}

There is nothing more pleasing to a\break
