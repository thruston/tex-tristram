I should lament from my soul, if\break

\stick{all the world over without any}

The same good will that made me\break

\natch{present,}
\stick{present, as half an hour’s amuse-}
\stick{ment will be more serviceable and} 
\stick{refreshing after labour and sorrow,}
than after a philosophical repast.

Nothing is so perfectly \textit{Amuse}-\break 
\stick{\textit{ment} as a total change of ideas; no}
\stick{ideas are so totally different as those}
\stick{of Ministers, and innocent Lovers:}
\stick{for which reason, when I come to} 
\stick{talk of Statesmen and Patriots, and} 
\stick{set such marks upon them as will}
\stck{prevent confusion and mistakes con-}

\initial[nindent=0pt]{I}{\ls{CALL}} all the powers of time\break
and chance, which severally check us\break
\stick{in our careers in this world, to bear me}
\stick{witness, that I could never yet get fairly}
\stick{to my uncle Toby’s amours, till this}
\stick{very moment, that my mother’s \textit{curiosity},}
\natch{as} 
\stick{as she stated the affair,\tsk\!\tsk or a different} 
\stick{impulse in her, as my father would have} 
\stick{it\tsh wished her to take a peep at them}
through the key-hole.

\lqq Call it, my dear, by its right name,\break
\stick{quoth my father, and look through the} 
key-hole as long as you will.”

Nothing but the fermentation of that\break
\stick{little subacid humour, which I have often}
\stick{spoken of, in my father’s habit, could}
\stick{have vented such an insinuation\tsh he} 
\stick{was however frank and generous in his}
\stick{nature, and at all times open to convic-}
\stick{tion; so that he had scarce got to the} 
\stick{last word of this ungracious retort, when}
his conscience smote him.\patch{My}

My mother was then conjugally 
\stick{swinging with her left arm twisted under}
\stick{his right, in such wise, that the inside of}
\stick{her hand rested upon the back of his\tsk}
\stick{she raised her fingers, and let them fall\tsk}
\stick{it could scarce be call’d a tap; or if it}
\stick{was a tap\tsh ’twould have puzzled a}
\stick{casuist to say, whether ’twas a tap of re-}
\stick{monstrance, or a tap of confession: my}
\stck{father, who was all sensibilities from head}
\stick{to foot, class’d it right\tsk Conscience re-}
\stick{doubled her blow\tsk he turn’d his face}
\stick{suddenly the other way, and my mother}
\stick{supposing his body was about to turn}
\stick{with it in order to move homewards,}
\stick{by a cross movement of her right leg,}
\stick{keeping her left as its centre, brought}
\stick{herself so far in front, that as he turned}
\natch{his}
\stick{his head, he met her eye\tsh Confu-}
\stick{sion again! he saw a thousand reasons to} 
\stick{wipe out the reproach, and as many to} 
\stick{reproach himself\tsh a thin, blue, chill,} 
\stick{pellucid chrystal with all its humours so} 
\stick{at rest, the least mote or speck of desire}
\stick{might have been seen at the bottom of} 
\stick{it, had it existed\tsh it did not\tsk\!\tsk and}
\stick{how I happen to be so lewd myself, par-}
\stick{ticularly a little before the vernal and}
\stick{autumnal equinoxes\tsh Heaven above}
\stick{knows\tsh My mother\tsh madam}
\stick{\tsh was so at no time, either by nature,} 
by institution, or example.

A temperate current of blood ran or-\break
\stick{derly through her veins in all months of}
\stick{the year, and in all critical moments both}
\natch{of}
\stick{of the day and night alike; nor did she}
\stick{superinduce the least heat into her hu-}
\stick{mours from the manual effervescencies} 
\stick{of devotional tracts, which having little} 
\stick{or no meaning in them, nature is oft} 
\stick{times obliged to find one\tsh And as for} 
\stick{my father’s example!  ’twas so far from} 
\stick{being either aiding or abetting thereunto,} 
\stick{that ’twas the whole business of his life}
\stick{to keep all fancies of that kind out of}
\stick{her head \tsh Nature had done her part,}
\stck{to have spared him this trouble; and what}
\stick{was not a little inconsistent, my father} 
\stick{knew it\tsh And here am I sitting, this}
\stick{12th day of August, 1766, in a pur-}
\stick{ple jerkin and yellow pair of slippers,} 
\stick{without either wig or cap on, a most}
\natch{tragi-} 
\stick{tragicomical completion of his predic-}
\stick{tion, \lqq That I should neither think,} 
\stick{\lqq nor act like any other man’s child,}
\stick{\lqq upon that very account.”\hfill}

The mistake of my father, was in\break 
\stick{attacking my mother’s motive, instead}
\stick{of the act itself; for certainly key-holes} 
\stick{were made for other purposes; and} 
\stick{considering the act, as an act which}
\stick{interfered with a true proposition, and}
\stick{denied a key-hole to be what it was}
\stick{\tsh it became a violation of nat-}
\stick{ure; and was so far, you see, cri-}
minal.

It is for this reason, an’ please\break
\stick{your Reverences, That key-holes are}
\natch{the}
\stick{the occasions of more sin and wicked-}
\stick{ness, than all other holes in this world}
put together.

\dropcap{T}{hough} the Corporal had\break
been as good as his word in put-\break
\stick{ting my uncle Toby’s great ramallie-wig}
\stick{into pipes, yet the time was too short}
\stick{to produce any great effects from it:} 
\stick{it had lain many years squeezed up in} 
\stick{the corner of his old campaign trunk;}
\stick{and as bad forms are not so easy to be} 
\stick{got the better of, and the use of candle-}
\stick{ends not so well understood, it was} 
\stick{not so pliable a business as one would} 
\stick{have wished. The Corporal with cheary}
\stick{eye and both arms extended, had fallen} 
\stick{back perpendicular from it a score times,}
\stick{to inspire it, if possible, with a better}
\stick{air\tsk had \textscl{spleen} given a look at it,}
\natch{’twould}
\stick{’twould have cost her ladyship a smile}
\stick{\tsh it curl’d every where but where the}
\stick{Corporal would have it; and where a}
\stick{buckle or two, in his opinion, would}
\stick{have done it honour, he could as soon}
have raised the dead.\etp

Such it was\tsh or rather such would\break
\stick{it have seem’d upon any other brow; but}
\stick{the sweet look of goodness which sat}
\stick{upon my uncle Toby’s, assimilated every}
\stick{thing around it so sovereignly to it-}
\stick{self, and Nature had moreover wrote}
\stick{\textscl{Gentleman} with so fair a hand in every}
\stick{line of his countenance, that even his}
\stick{tarnish’d gold laced hat and huge cock-}
\stick{ade of flimsy taffeta became him; and}
\stick{though not worth a button in themselves,}
\stick{yet the moment my uncle Toby put}
\stick{them on, they became serious objects,}
\natch{and}
\stck{and altogether seem’d to have been picked} 
\stick{up by the hand of Science to set him off}
to advantage.

\etp

Nothing in this world could have co-\break
\stick{operated more powerfully towards this,}
\stick{than my uncle Toby’s blue and gold\tsh}
\stick{\itshape had not Quantity in some measure been ne-} 
\stick{\textit{cessary to Grace:} in a period of fifteen or} 
\stick{sixteen years since they had been made,} 
\stick{by a total inactivity in my uncle Toby’s} 
\stick{life, for he seldom went further than the}
\stick{bowling-green\tsk his blue and gold had}
\stick{become so miserably too strait for him,} 
\stick{that it was with the utmost difficulty the} 
\stick{Corporal was able to get him into them:}
\stick{the taking them up at the sleeves, was}
\stick{of no advantage.\tsk\ They were laced} 
\stick{however down the back, and at the seams}
\stick{of the sides, \&c.\@ in the mode of King}
\natch{William’s}
\stick{William’s reign; and to shorten all de-}
\stck{scription, they shone so bright against the}
\stick{sun that morning, and had so metallick,}
\stick{and doughty an air with them, that had}
\stick{my uncle Toby thought of attacking in} 
\stick{armour, nothing could have so well im-}
posed upon his imagination.

As for the thin scarlet breeches, they\break
\stick{had been unripp’d by the taylor between}
the legs, and left at \textit{sixes and sevens}\tsh

\tsh Yes, Madam,\tsh but let us go-\break
\stick{vern our fancies. It is enough they}
\stick{were held impracticable the night before,}
\stick{and as there was no alternative in my}
\stick{uncle Toby’s wardrobe, he sallied forth}
in the red plush.\etp

The Corporal had array’d himself in\break
\stick{poor \hbox{Le Fevre’s} regimental coat; and}
\natch{with} 
\stick{with his hair tuck’d up under his Mon-}
\stick{tero cap, which he had furbish’d up} 
\stick{for the occasion, march’d three paces}
\stick{distant from his master: a whiff of mi-}
\stick{litary pride had puff’d out his shirt at}
\stick{the wrist; and upon that in a black lea-}
\stick{ther thong clipp’d into a tassel beyond}
\stick{the knot, hung the Corporal’s stick\tsh}
\stick{My uncle Toby carried his cane like a} 
pike.

\tsh It looks well at least; quoth my\break
father to himself.

\dropcap[findent=2pt]{M}{y} uncle Toby turn’d his head\break
more than once behind him, to\break
\stick{see how he was supported by the Corpo-}
\stick{ral; and the Corporal as oft as he did} 
\stick{it, gave a slight flourish with his stick\tsk} 
\stick{but not vapouringly; and with the sweet-}
\stick{est accent of most respectful encourage-}
ment, bid his honour \lqq never fear.\/”

Now my uncle Toby did fear; and\break
\stick{grievously too; he knew not (as my fa-}
\stick{ther had reproach’d him) so much as the} 
\stick{right end of a Woman from the wrong,} 
\stick{and therefore was never altogether at his}
\stick{ease near any one of them\tsh unless in}
\stick{sorrow or distress; then infinite was his}
\stick{pity; nor would the most courteous}
\natch{knight}
\stick{knight of romance have gone further, at} 
\stick{least upon one leg, to have wiped away} 
\stick{a tear from a woman’s eye; and yet ex-} 
\stick{cepting once that he was beguiled into} 
\stick{it by Mrs.\@ Wadman, he had never looked} 
\stick{stedfastly into one; and would often tell}
\stick{my father in the simplicity of his heart,} 
\stick{that it was almost (if not alout) as bad} 
as talking bawdy.\tsh

\tsh And suppose it is? my father\break would say.

halting, when they had march’d up\break

\tsh She will take it, an’ please your\break

\stick{the end of a long cane, flapping away}
\stick{flies\tsk not killing them.\tsh ’Tis a pretty}
\stick{picture! said my uncle Toby\tsk she had}
\stck{suffered persecution, Trim, and had learnt}
mercy\tsh

\tsh She was good, an’ please your\break
\stick{honour, from nature as well as from}
\stick{hardships; and there are circumstances}
\stick{in the story of that poor friendless slut,} 
\stick{that would melt a heart of stone, said} 
\stick{Trim; and some dismal winter’s evening,}
\stick{when your honour is in the humour, they}
\natch{shall} 
\stick{shall be told you with the rest of Tom’s}
\stick{story, for it makes a part of it\tsh}

Then do not forget, Trim, said my\break
uncle Toby.

A Negro has a soul? an’ please your\break
\stick{honour, said the Corporal (doubt-}
ingly).

\tight{I am not much versed, Corporal, quoth}\break
\stick{my uncle Toby, in things of that kind;} 
\stick{but I suppose, God would not leave him} 
\stick{without one, any more than thee or} 
me\tsh

\tsk It would be putting one sadly\break
\stick{over the head of another, quoth the}
Corporal.\patch{It}

It would so; said my uncle Toby.\break
\stick{Why then, an’ please your honour, is a}
\stick{black wench to be used worse than a}
white one?

I can give no reason, said my uncle\break
Toby\tsh

\tsh Only, cried the Corporal, shaking\break
\stick{his head, because she has no one to stand}
up for her\tsh

\tsh ’Tis that very thing, Trim, quoth
\stick{my uncle Toby,\tsh which recommends}
\stick{her to protection\tsh and her brethren}
\stick{with her; ’tis the fortune of war which}
\stick{has put the whip into our hands \textit{now}\tsh}
\stick{where it may be hereafter, heaven}
\stick{knows!\tsk but be it where it will,}
\natch{the}
\stick{the brave, Trim! will not use it un-}
kindly.

\tsh God forbid, said the Corporal.

Amen, responded my uncle Toby,\break
laying his hand upon his heart.

The Corporal returned to his story,\break
\stick{and went on\tsh but with an embar-}
\stick{rassment in doing it, which here and} 
\stick{there a reader in this world will not be}
\stick{able to comprehend; for by the many} 
\stick{sudden transitions all along, from one}
\stick{kind and cordial passion to another, in} 
\stick{getting thus far on his way, he had lost}
\stick{the sportable key of his voice which}
\stick{gave sense and spirit to his tale: he} 
\stick{attempted twice to resume it, but could}
\natch{not} 
\stick{not please himself; so giving a stout} 
\stick{hem! to rally back the retreating spirits,} 
\stick{and aiding Nature at the same time with}
\stick{his left arm a-kimbo on one side, and} 
\stick{with his right a little extended, support-}
\stick{ing her on the other\tsk the Corporal got}
\stick{as near the note as he could; and in that}
attitude, continued his story.

\dropcap[findent=0pt]{A}{s} Tom, an’ please your honour,\break
had no business at that time with\break
\stick{the Moorish girl, he passed on into the} 
\stick{room beyond to talk to the Jew’s widow}
\stick{about love\tsh and this pound of saus-}
\stick{ages; and being, as I have told your} 
\stick{honour, an open, cheary hearted lad,} 
\stick{with his character wrote in his looks and} 
\stick{carriage, he took a chair, and without} 
\stick{much apology, but with great civi-}

There is nothing so awkward, as\break
\stick{courting a woman, an’ please your ho-}
\stick{nour, whilst she is making sausages\tsh}
\stick{So Tom began a discourse upon them;}
\natch{first,}
\stick{first, gravely,\tsh \lqq as how they were}
\stick{\lqq made\tsh with what meats, herbs,}
\stick{\lqq and spices”\tsk Then a little gayly\tsk}
\stick{as, \lqq With what skins\tsh and if they}
\stick{\lqq never burst\tsh Whether the largest}
\stick{\lqq were not the best”\tsk and so on\tsk}
\stick{taking care only as he went along, to}
\stick{season what he had to say upon sausages,}
\stick{rather under, than over;\tsh that he} 
might have room to act in\tsh

\tight{It was owing to the neglect of that very}\break
\stick{precaution, said my uncle Toby, laying}
\stick{his hand upon Trim’s shoulder, That}
\stick{Count de la Motte lost the battle of} 
\stick{Wynendale: he pressed too speedily into}
\stick{the wood; which if he had not done,} 
\stick{Lisle had not fallen into our hands, nor} 
\stick{Ghent and Bruges, which both followed}
\natch{her} 
\stick{her example; it was so late in the year,} 
\stick{continued my uncle Toby, and so terrible} 
\stick{a season came on, that if things had not}
\stick{fallen out as they did, our troops must}
have perished in the open field.\tsh

\tsh Why, therefore, may not battles,\break
\stick{an’ please your honour, as well as mar-}
\stick{riages, be made in heaven?\tsk My uncle}
Toby mused.\tsh

Religion inclined him to say one thing,\break
\stick{and his high idea of military skill tempt-}
\stick{ed him to say another; so not being able}
\stick{to frame a reply exactly to his mind}
\stick{\tsh my uncle Toby said nothing at}
\stick{all; and the Corporal finished his}
story.\patch{As}

As Tom perceived, an’ please your\break
\stick{honour, that he gained ground, and that}
\stick{all he had said upon the subject of saus-}
\stick{ages was kindly taken, he went on to} 
\stick{help her a little in making them.\tsh}
\stick{First, by taking hold of the ring of} 
\stick{the sausage whilst she stroked the forced}
\stick{meat down with her hand\tsh then by} 
\stick{cutting the strings into proper lengths,} 
\stick{and holding them in his hand, whilst} 
\stick{she took them out one by one\tsh then,}
\stick{by putting them across her mouth, that}
\stick{she might take them out as she wanted}
\stick{them\tsh and so on from little to more,} 
\stick{till at last he adventured to tie the}
\stick{sausage himself, whilst she held the}
snout.\tsh

\tsh Now a widow, an’ please your\break
\stick{honour, always chuses a second husband}
\natch{as} 
\stick{as unlike the first as she can: so the}
\stick{affair was more than half settled in her}
mind before Tom mentioned it.

She made a feint however of defend-\break
\stick{ing herself, by snatching up a sausage:}
\stick{\tsh Tom instantly laid hold of ano-}
ther\tsh

But seeing Tom’s had more gristle in\break
it\tsh

She signed the capitulation\tsh and\break
\stick{Tom sealed it; and there was an end of} 
the matter.

\stick{apparently to the good and quiet of the}
\stick{world\tsh and particularly that branch}

\stick{\tsh whenever that drum beats in our}

In pronouncing this, my uncle Toby\break

I will not argue the matter: Time\break

\dropcap{U}{pon} looking back from the end\break

\stick{the texture of what has been wrote, it is} 
\stick{necessary, that upon this page and the}

\stick{rogeneous matter be inserted, to keep up} 
\stick{that just balance betwixt wisdom and} 
\stick{folly, without which a book would not}
\stick{hold together a single year: nor is it a} 
\stick{poor creeping digression (which but for} 
\stick{the name of, a man might continue as} 
\stick{well going on in the king’s highway)} 
\stick{which will do the business\tsh no; if it} 
\stick{is to be a digression, it must be a good} 
\stick{frisky one, and upon a frisky subject too,} 
\stick{where neither the horse or his rider are} 
to be caught, but by rebound.\etp\patch{The}

The only difficulty, is raising powers\break
\stick{suitable to the nature of the service:}
\stick{\textscl{Fancy} is capricious\tsk \textscl{Wit} must not be}
\stick{searched for\tsk and \textscl{Pleasantry} (good-}
\stick{natured slut as she is) will not come in} 
\stick{at a call, was an empire to be laid at her}
feet.

\tsh The best way for a man, is to\break
say his prayers\tsh

Only if it puts him in mind of his in-\break
\stick{firmities and defects as well ghostly as} 
\stick{bodily\tsk for that purpose, he will find} 
\stick{himself rather worse after he has said}
\stick{them than before\tsk for other purposes,}
better.

For my own part there is not a way\break
\stick{either moral or mechanical under heaven}
\natch{that} 
\stick{that I could think of, which I have not}
\stick{taken with myself in this case: some-}
\stick{times by addressing myself directly to th\lower.25ex\hbox{e}\sic}
\stick{soul herself, and arguing the point over} 
\stick{and over again with her upon the extent}
of her own faculties\tsh

\tsh I never could make them an inch\break
the wider\tsh

Then by changing my system, and\break
\stick{trying what could be made of it upon}
\stick{the body, by temperance, soberness and}
\stck{chastity: These are good, quoth I, in them-}
\stick{selves\tsk they are good, absolutely;\tsk they}
\stick{are good, relatively;\tsk they are good for}
\stick{health\tsk they are good for happiness in} 
\stick{this world\tsk they are good for happiness} 
in the next\tsh\patch{In}

In short, they were good for every\break
\stick{thing but the thing wanted; and there}
\stick{they were good for nothing, but to leave}
\stick{the soul just as heaven made it: as for} 
\stick{the theological virtues of faith and hope,}
\stick{they give it courage; but then that snive-}
\stick{ling virtue of Meekness (as my father} 
\stick{would always call it) takes it quite away}
\stick{again, so you are exactly where you} 
started.

\tight{Now in all common and ordinary cases,}\break
\stick{there is nothing which I have found to} 
answer so well as this\tsh

\tsh Certainly, if there is any depend-\break
\stick{ence upon Logic, and that I am not}
\stick{blinded by self-love, there must be}
\stick{something of true genius about me,}
\stick{merely upon this symptom of it, that I}

For this cause, when your honours\break

\stick{reverences have done with them\tsh}
\stick{they might lead me into mischief: the}
\stick{safest way is to follow the tract of the}
\natch{learned,} 
\stck{learned, and raise objections against what} 
\stick{I have been writing, tho’ I declare before-}
\stick{hand, I know no more than my heels} 
how to answer them.

And first, it may be said, there is a\break
\stick{pelting kind of \textit{thersitical} satire, as black}
\stick{as the very ink ’tis wrote with\tsh (and} 
\stick{by the bye, whoever says so, is indebted} 
\stick{to the muster-master general of the Gre-}
\stick{cian army, for suffering the name of}
\stick{so ugly and foul-mouth’d a man as}
\stick{\textit{Thersites} to continue upon his roll\tsh}
\stick{for it has furnish’d him with an epithet)}
\stick{\tsh in these productions he will urge,} 
\stick{all the personal washings and scrubbings}
\stick{upon earth do a sinking genius no sort}
\stick{of good\tsh but just the contrary, inas-}
\natch{much}
\stick{much as the dirtier the fellow is, the}
better generally he succeeds in it.

To this, I have no other answer\tsh\break
\stick{at least ready\tsk\!\tsk but that the Arch-}
\stick{bishop of Benevento wrote his \textit{nasty} Ro-}
\stick{mance of the Galatea, as all the world}
\stick{knows, in a purple coat, waistcoat, and}
\stick{purple pair of breeches; and that the}
\stick{penance set him of writing a commen-}
\stick{tary upon the book of the Revelations,}
\stick{as severe as it was look’d upon by one}
\stick{part of the world, was far from being}
\stick{deem’d so, by the other, upon the single}
account of that \textit{Investment}.

Another objection, to all this remedy,\break
\stick{is its want of universality; forasmuch as} 
\stick{the shaving part of it, upon which so}
\natch{much}
\stick{much stress is laid, by an unalterable law}
\stick{of nature excludes one half of the spe-}
\stick{cies entirely from its use: all I can say is,}
\stick{that female writers, whether of England,}
\stick{or of France, must e’en go without}
it\tsh

As for the Spanish ladies\tsh I am in no sort of
distress\tsh

\natch{were} 
\stick{were rough or smooth, it made no dif-}

\stick{with, touch’d upon some secret spring}
either of sentiment or rapture.

\tsh They were the sweetest notes I\break
\stick{ever heard; and I instantly let down the}

\stick{\tsh ’Tis Maria; said the postillion,}
\stick{observing I was listening\tsh Poor}
\stick{Maria, continued he, (leaning his body} 
\stick{on one side to let me see her, for he was}
\stick{in a line betwixt us) is sitting upon a} 
\stick{bank playing her vespers upon her pipe,} 
with her little goat beside her.

The young fellow utter’d this with an\break
\stick{accent and a look so perfectly in tune to}
\stick{a feeling heart, that I instantly made a}
\natch{vow,}
\stick{vow, I would give him a four and}
\stick{twenty sous piece, when I got to}
\textit{Moulins}\tsh

\tsh And who is \textit{poor Maria\;?}\break
said~I.

The love and pity of all the villages\break
\stick{around us; said the postillion\tsh it is}
\stick{but three years ago, that the sun did not}
\stick{shine upon so fair, so quick-witted and} 
\stick{amiable a maid; and better fate did} 
\stick{\textit{Maria} deserve, than to have her Banns}
\stick{forbid, by the intrigues of the curate of} 
the parish who published them\tsh

He was going on, when Maria, who\break
\stick{had made a short pause, put the pipe} 
\stick{to her mouth and began the air again}
\natch{\tsk\!\tsk they}
\stick{\tsh they were the same notes;\tsh yet}
\stick{were ten times sweeter: It is the evening}
\stick{service to the Virgin, said the young}
\stick{man\tsh but who has taught her to} 
\stick{play it\tsk or how she came by her pipe,} 
\stick{no one knows; we think that Heaven has} 
\stick{assisted her in both; for ever since she}
\stick{has been unsettled in her mind, it seems} 
\stick{her only consolation\tsh she has never} 
\stick{once had the pipe out of her hand, but} 
\stick{plays that \textit{service} upon it almost night}
and day.

The postillion delivered this with so\break
\stick{much discretion and natural eloquence,} 
\stick{that I could not help decyphering some-}
\stick{thing in his face above his condition,} 
\stick{and should have sifted out his history,}
\natch{had} 
\stick{had not poor Maria's taken such full}
possession of me.

We had got up by this time almost\break

\stick{hair, all but two tresses, drawn up into a} 
\stick{silk net, with a few olive leaves twisted}
\stick{a little fantastically on one side\tsh she} 
\stick{was beautiful; and if ever I felt the full}
\stick{force of an honest heart-ache, it was the}
moment I saw her\tsh

\dropcap[findent=0pt]{A}{s} Mrs.\@ Bridget open’d the
door\break before the Corporal had well given the rap, the interval
betwixt that and\break my uncle Toby’s introduction into the
parlour, was so short, that Mrs.\@ Wadman had but just time to
get from behind the curtain\tsh lay a Bible upon the
table, and advance a step or two towards the door to receive
him.

My uncle Toby saluted Mrs.\@ Wad-\break man, after the
manner in which women were saluted by men in the year of our Lord
God one thousand seven hundred and thirteen\tsh then
facing about, he march’d up abreast with her to the\catch{sopha,} sopha,
and in three plain words\tsk\tsk\break 
though not before he was sat down\tsh\break
nor after he was sat down\tsh\break but as he
was sitting down, told her,\break 
\lqq \textit{he was in love}”\tsh so that my uncle Toby strained
himself more in the declaration than he needed.

Mrs.\@ Wadman naturally looked down, upon a slit she had
been darning up in her apron, in expectation every moment, that my
uncle Toby would go on; but having no talents for
amplification, and \ls{\textscl{Love}} moreover of all others being a\break subject of
which he was the least a master\tsh When he had told 
Mrs.\@ Wadman once that he loved her, he let it alone, and left the
matter to work after\break its own way.\patch{My}

My father was always in raptures with this system of my uncle
Toby’s, as he falsely called it, and would often say,
that could his brother Toby to his processe have added but a
pipe of tobacco\tsh \break he had wherewithal to have found his
way, if there was faith in a Spanish proverb, towards the
hearts of half the women upon the globe.

My uncle Toby never understood what my father meant; nor
will I presume to extract more from it, than a\break
\stick{condemnation of an error which the}
\stick{bulk of the world lie under\tsh but the}
\stick{French, every one of ’em to a man,}
\stick{who believe in it, almost as much as}
\stick{the \ls{\textscl{real presence}}, \lqq \textit{That talking of}} 
\stick{\lqq \textit{love, is making it}.\,”\hfill}\patch{\tsh I}

\tsh I would as soon set about\break
making a black-pudding by the same\break
receipt.

Let us go on: Mrs.\@ Wadman sat in\break
\stick{expectation my uncle Toby would do so,} 
\stick{to almost the first pulsation of that mi-}
\stick{nute, wherein silence on one side or}
the other, generally becomes
indecent: so edging herself a little more towards him, and raising
up her eyes, sub-blushing, as she did it\tsh she took up
the gauntlet\tsh or the discourse (if you like it better)
and communed with my uncle Toby, thus.

The cares and disquietudes of the marriage state, quoth Mrs.\@ Wadman,\catch{are} are very
great. I suppose so\tsk said my uncle Toby: and therefore when a person, continued
Mrs.\@ Wadman, is so much at his ease as you are\tsk so happy, captain
Shandy, in yourself, your friends and your amusements\tsk I wonder, what
reasons can incline you to the state\tsh


\tsh They are written, quoth my uncle Toby, in
the Common-Prayer Book.


Thus far my uncle Toby went on warily, and kept within
his depth, leaving Mrs.\@ Wadman to sail upon the gulph as she
pleased.

\etp
\tsk As for children\tsk said Mrs.\@ Wadman\tsk though a principal end perhaps of\break 
\stck{the institution, and the natural wish, I sup-}
\stick{pose, of every parent\tsk yet do not we all}
find, they are certain sorrows, and very\catch{uncertain} uncertain comforts? and what is there,
dear sir, to pay one for the heart-achs\tsk\break
what compensation for the many tender and
disquieting apprehensions of a suffering and defenceless mother who brings them into
life? I declare, said my uncle Toby, smit with pity, I know of none; unless it be
the pleasure which it has pleased God\tsh

\tsh A fiddlestick! quoth she.

\dropcap{N}{ow} there are such an infinitude of
notes, tunes, cants, chants, airs, looks, and accents with which
the word \textit{fiddlestick} may be pronounced in all
such causes as this, every one of ’em impressing a sense and
meaning as different from the other, as \textit{dirt} from
\textit{cleanliness}\break\tsk That Casuists (for it is an affair of
conscience on that score) reckon up no less than fourteen thousand
in which you may do either right or wrong.

Mrs.\@ Wadman hit upon the \textit{fiddlestick}, which
summoned up all my uncle Toby’s modest blood into his
cheeks\tsk so feeling within himself that he had somehow or other
got beyond his depth, he stopt\etp\catch{short;}
\stck{short; and without entering further either} 
into the pains or pleasures of matrimony, he laid his hand
upon his heart, and made an offer to take them as they were, and
share them along with her.

When my uncle Toby had said this, he did not care to say
it again; so casting his eye upon the Bible which 
Mrs.\@ Wadman had laid upon the table, he took it up; and popping,
dear soul! upon a passage in it, of all others the most interesting
to him\tsk which was the siege of Jericho\tsk he set
himself to read it over\tsk leaving his proposal of marriage, as he had done his declaration of love, to work with
her after its own way. Now it wrought neither as an astringent or a
loosener; nor like opium, or bark, or mercury, or buckthorn, or any
one\etp\catch{drug} drug which nature had bestowed upon the world\tsk in short,
it work’d not at all in her; and the cause of that was, that
there was something working there before\tsh Babbler that
I am! I have anticipated what it was a dozen times; but there is
fire still in the subject\tsh\break allons.

\dropcap{I}{t} is natural for a perfect stranger
who is going from London to Edin\-burgh, to enquire
before he sets out, how many miles to York; which is\break
\stick{about the half way\tsh nor does any} 
body wonder, if he goes on
and asks about the Corporation, \&c.\@ - -

It was just as natural for Mrs.\@ Wadman, whose first
husband was all his time afflicted with a Sciatica, to wish to know
how far from the hip to the groin;\break and how far she was likely to suffer more or less in
her feelings, in the one case than in the other.

She had accordingly read \textit{Drake}’s anatomy from one end
to the other. She\etp\catch{had} had peeped into \textit{Wharton}
upon the brain, and borrowed \fnast\ Graaf upon the bones and
muscles; but could make nothing\break of it.

She had reason’d likewise from her own
powers\tsh laid down theorems\break\tsh drawn
consequences, and come to no conclusion.

To clear up all, she had twice asked
\stick{Doctor Slop, \lqq if poor captain Shandy}
\stick{\lqq was ever likely to recover of his}
\stick{\lqq wound\tsh ?”\hfill}

\tsh He is recovered, Doctor Slop would
say\tsh

\vfill\rightline{What!}\eject

What! quite?

\tsh Quite: madam\tsh

But what do you mean by a recovery? Mrs.\@ Wadman would
say.

Doctor Slop was the worst man alive at definitions; and
so Mrs.\@ Wadman could get no knowledge: in short, there was
no way to extract it, but from my uncle Toby himself.

There is an accent of humanity in an enquiry of this kind which
lulls \textscl{Suspicion} to rest\tsh and I am half
persuaded the serpent got pretty near it, in his discourse with
Eve; for the propensity in the sex to be deceived could not be so
great, that she should have boldness to hold chat with the devil,
without it\tsh\catch{But} But there is an accent of
humanity\tsh\break how shall I describe it?\tsk ’tis an
accent which covers the part with a garment, and gives the enquirer
a right to be as particular with it, as your body-surgeon.

\stick{were so tenderly spoke to, and so directed}
\stick{towards my uncle Toby’s heart, that} 
\stick{every item of them sunk ten times deeper}
\stick{into it than the evils themselves\tsh but}
\stick{when Mrs.\@ Wadman went round about by}
\stick{Namur to get at my uncle Toby’s groin;}
\stick{and engaged him to attack the point of}
the advanced counterscarp, and \textit{pêle mêle}\etp\catch{with}
with the Dutch to take the counterguard of St.\@ Roch
sword in hand\tsk and then with tender notes playing upon his
ear, led him all bleeding by the hand out of the trench, wiping her
eye, as he was carried to his tent\tsh Heaven! Earth!
Sea!\tsk all was lifted up\tsk the springs of\break
\stick{nature rose above their levels\tsk an angel}
\stick{of mercy sat besides him on the sopha\tsk}
\stick{his heart glow’d with fire\tsk and had he}
\stick{been worth a thousand, he had lost every}\break
heart of them to Mrs.\@ Wadman.

\tsk And whereabouts, dear sir, quoth Mrs.\@ Wadman, a
little categorically, did you receive this sad
blow?\tsk\ In asking this question, Mrs.\@ Wadman gave
a slight glance towards the waistband of my uncle
Toby’s red plush breeches, ex-\catch{pecting} pecting naturally, as the
shortest reply to it, that my uncle Toby would lay his
fore-finger upon the place\tsh It fell out
otherwise\tsh for my uncle Toby having got his wound before the gate of St.\@ Nicolas,
in one of the traverses of the trench, opposite to the salient angle
of the demi-bastion of St.\@ Roch ; he could at any time stick a
pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing when
the stone struck him : this struck instantly upon my uncle
Toby’s sensorium\tsh and with it, struck his
large map of the town and citadel of Namur and its environs,
which he had purchased and pasted down upon a board, by the\break
\stick{Corporal’s aid, during his long illness}
\stick{\tsh it had lain with other military lum-}
ber in the garret ever since, and accord-\etp\catch{ingly} ingly the Corporal was detached to the garret to fetch
it.

My uncle Toby measured off thirty toises, with 
Mrs.\@ Wadman’s scissars, from the returning angle before the
gate of St.\@ Nicolas ; and with such a virgin modesty laid her
finger upon the place, that the goddess of Decency, if then in
being\tsk if not, ’twas her shade\tsk shook her head, and
with a finger wavering across her eyes\tsk forbid her to explain
the\break mistake.

Unhappy Mrs.\@ Wadman!\tsh

\tsh For nothing can make this chapter go off with
spirit but an apostrophe to thee\tsh but my heart tells
me, that in such a crisis an apostrophe is but an in-\catch{sult} sult in
disguise, and ere I would offer\break one to a woman in

made a confident of my mother; and that Mrs.\@ Bridget, who

behind the garden-wall.

As for my mother, she saw nothing at all in it, to make the

by herself for all the ends and purposes you could possibly have,
in exporting a fa-\catch{mily} mily secret; for she instantly imparted it by

the first fall of Adam, down to my uncle Toby’s

appetite.

Yorick was just bringing my father’s hypothesis to

provision should be
made for continuing the race
of so great, so exalted and godlike a
Being as man\tsk I am far from denying\tsk\break
but philosophy speaks freely of every thing; and therefore I still think and do
maintain it to be a pity, that it should be done by means of a
passion which bends down the faculties, and turns all the wisdom,
contemplations, and opera\-tions of the soul backwards\tsh a
passion, my dear, continued my father, addressing himself to my
mother, which couples and equals wise men with fools, and makes us
come out of our caverns and hiding-places more like satyrs and
four-footed beasts than men.\etp\patch{I know}

I know it will be said, continued my father (availing himself of
the \textit{Prolepsis})\break that in itself, and simply
taken\tsh like hunger, or thirst, or sleep\tsh ’tis an affair
neither good or bad\tsk or shameful or otherwise.\tsh Why then
did the delicacy of \textit{Diogenes} and \textit{Plato} so
recalcitrate against it? and wherefore, when we go about to make
and plant a man, do we put out the candle? and for what reason
is it, that all the parts thereof\tsk the congredients\tsk the
preparations\tsk the instruments, and whatever serves thereto,
are so held as to be conveyed to a cleanly mind by no language,
translation, or periphrasis whatever?

\tsh The act of killing and destroying a man, continued
my father, raising his voice\tsk and turning to my uncle
Toby\tsk\etp\catch{you} you see, is glorious\tsk and the weapons by
which we do it are honourable\tsh We march with them upon
our shoulders\tsk\break We strut with them by our
sides\tsh We gild them\tsh We carve
them\tsh We in-lay them\tsh We enrich
them\tsh\break Nay, if it be but a \textit{scoundril} cannon, we
cast an ornament upon the breech of it.\tsk

\tsh My uncle Toby laid down his pipe to
intercede for a better epithet\tsh\break and Yorick was
rising up to batter the whole hypothesis to
pieces\tsh

\tsh When Obadiah broke into the middle of the
room with a complaint, which cried out for an immediate
hear-\break ing.

The case was this:\patch{My}

My father, whether by ancient custom of the manor, or as
improprietor of the great tythes, was obliged to keep a\break Bull for
the service of the Parish, and Obadiah had led his cow upon
a \textit{pop-visit} to him one day or other the preceding
summer\tsh I say, one day or other\tsk because as chance
would have it,\break it was the day on which he was married to my
father’s house-maid\tsh so one was a reckoning to
the other. Therefore when Obadiah’s wife was brought
to\break
bed\tsk Obadiah thanked God\tsh

\tsh Now, said Obadiah, I shall have a calf: so
Obadiah went daily to visit his cow.\patch{She’ll}

She’ll calve on Monday\tsk on
Tuesday\break\tsk or Wednesday at the
farthest\tsh

The cow did not calve\tsh no\tsk she’ll not calve till next week\tsh the cow put it
off terribly\tsh till at the end of the sixth week Obadiah’s suspicions (like a
good man’s) fell upon the Bull.

Now the parish being very large, my father’s Bull, to
speak the truth of him, was no way equal to the department; he had,
however, got himself, somehow or other, thrust into
employment\tsk and as he went through the business with a grave
face, my father had a high opinion of him.\patch{\tsh Most}

\tsh Most of the townsmen, an’ please your
worship, quoth Obadiah, believe that ’tis all the
Bull’s fault\tsh

\tsh But may not a cow be barren?\break
replied my father, turning to Doctor\break Slop.

It never happens: said Dr.\@ Slop, but the man’s wife
may have come before her time naturally enough\tsh Prithee
has the child hair upon his head?\tsk\break added Dr.\@ Slop\tsh

\tsh It is as hairy as I am; said Obadiah.\tsh Obadiah had not been shaved for
three weeks\tsh Wheu - - u - - - -\break u - - - - - - - - cried my father; beginning the
sentence with an exclamatory\catch{whistle} whistle\tsh and so, brother Toby, this poor Bull of
mine, who is as good a Bull as ever p—ss’d, and might have done for
Europa herself in purer times\break\tsh had he but two legs less, might\break have
been driven into Doctors Commons and lost his character\tsh which to a\break Town Bull,
brother Toby, is the very\break same thing as his life\tsh

L-\kern 0.05em -\kern 0.05em d! said my mother, what is all\break this story about?\tsh

A {\addfontfeature{LetterSpace=40}COCK} and 
a {\addfontfeature{LetterSpace=40}BULL}, said\break
Yorick\tsh And one of the best of its kind, I ever
heard.
