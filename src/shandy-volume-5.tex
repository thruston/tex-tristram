\dropcap{I}{f} it had not been for those two\break
mettlesome tits, and that madcap of\break
a postillion, who drove them
from Stilton to Stamford, the thought had never entered my head. He
flew like lightning\tsh there was a slope of three miles
and a half\tsh we scarce touched the
ground\tsh the motion was most rapid\break\tsk most
impetuous\tsh ’twas communicat-\catch{ed} ed to my
brain\tsk my heart partook of it\break
\tsh By the great God of day, said I, looking towards the
sun, and thrusting my arm out of the fore-window of the
chaise, as I made my vow, \lqq I will\break
lock up my study door the moment I\break
get home, and throw the key of it nine-\break
ty feet below the surface of the earth,\break
into the draw-well at the back of my\break
house.\,”

The London waggon confirmed me in my resolution; it hung
tottering upon the hill, scarce progressive, drag’d\tsk
drag’d up by eight \textit{heavy beasts}\tsk \lqq by main
strength!\tsk quoth I, nodding\tsk\break
but your betters draw the same way\tsk\break
and something of every bodies!\tsh\break
O rare!”\patch{Tell}

Tell me, ye learned, shall we for ever be adding so much to the
\textit{bulk}\tsk so little to the \textit{stock?}

Shall we for ever make new books, as apothecaries make new
mixtures, by pouring only out of one vessel into another?

Are we for ever to be twisting, and untwisting the same rope?
for ever in the same track\tsk for ever at the same pace?

Shall we be destined to the days of eternity, on holy-days, as
well as work\-ing-days, to be shewing the \textit{relicks
of\break learning},
as monks do the relicks of their\break saints\tsk without working
one\tsk one single miracle with them?\patch{Who}

Who made \textsc{Man}, with powers which dart him from earth to heaven in a moment\tsk that
great, that most excellent, and most noble creature of the world\tsk the
\textit{miracle} of nature, as Zoroaster in his book {\small
περὶ ϕυσεως} called him\tsk the
\textsc{She\-kinah} of the divine presence, as Chry\-sostom\tsh the \textit{image}
of God, as Moses\tsh the \textit{ray} of divinity, as Plato\tsk the \textit{marvel} of
\textit{marvels}, as Aristotle\tsk to go sneaking on at this
pitiful\tsk pimping\tsk
petti-\break fogging rate?

I scorn to be as abusive as Horace upon the
occasion\tsh but if there is no\break catachresis in the wish,
and no sin in it, I wish from my soul, that every imitator in
\textit{Great Britain, France}, and \textit{Ireland}, had the farcy for
his pains; and that there was a good farcical house, large enough
to hold\tsk aye\tsk and sublimate\catch{them,} them, \textit{shag-rag and
bob-tail}, male and\break female, all together: and this leads me to
the affair of \textit{Whiskers}\tsh but, by what chain of
ideas\tsk I leave as a legacy in\break \textit{mort main} to Prudes and
Tartufs, to enjoy and make the most of.

\centerline{\textit{Upon Whiskers}.}

I’m sorry I made it\tsh ’twas as
inconsiderate a promise as ever entered a man’s
head\tsh A chapter upon whiskers! alas! the world will not
bear it\tsk ’tis a delicate world\tsk but I knew
not of what mettle it was made\tsk nor had I ever seen the
underwritten fragment; otherwise, as surely as noses are noses,
and whiskers are whiskers still; (let the world say what it will to
the contrary) so surely would I have steered clear of this
dangerous chapter.\patch{\textit{The}}

\noindent
\centerline{\textit{The Fragment}.}
\stick{\astfill}
\stick{\astfill}
\stick{\ast\ \ast\tsh You are half asleep, my good}
lady, said the old gentleman, taking\break
hold of the old lady’s hand and giving\break
it a gentle squeeze, as he pronounced\break
the word \textit{Whiskers}\tsh shall we change\break
the subject? By no means, replied the\break
old lady\tsk I like your account of these\break
matters: so throwing a thin gauze\break
handkerchief over her head, and leaning\break
it back upon the chair with her face\break
turned towards him, and advancing her\break
two feet as she reclined herself\tsk I desire,\break
continued she, you will go on.

The old gentleman went on as follows.\break\tsh Whiskers!
cried the queen of \textit{Navarre}, dropping her knotting-ball, as
\textit{La Fosseuse} uttered the word\tsh Whis-\catch{kers;} kers; madam,
said \textit{La Fosseuse}, pinning the ball to the queen’s
apron, and making a courtesy as she repeated it.

\textit{La Fosseuse}’s voice was naturally soft and low, yet
’twas an articulate voice: and every letter of the word
\textit{whiskers} fell distinctly upon the queen of
\textit{Navarre}’s ear\tsk Whiskers! cried the queen, laying
a greater stress upon the word, and as if she had still distrusted
her ears\tsk Whiskers; replied \textit{La Fosseuse},
repeating the word a third time\tsk There is not a
cavalier, madam, of his age in \textit{Navarre}, continued the maid
of honour, pressing the page’s interest upon the queen, that
has so gallant a pair\tsk Of what? cried
\textit{Margaret}, smiling\tsh Of whiskers, said \textit{La Fosseuse},
with infinite modesty.\patch{The}

The word whiskers still stood its\break
ground, and continued to be made use\break
of in most of the best companies through\-out the little kingdom of \textit{Navarre},
not\-withstanding the indiscreet use which \textit{La
Fosseuse} had made of it: the truth was,\break \textit{La
Fosseuse} had pronounced the word, not only before the
queen, but upon sun\-dry other occasions at court, with an
accent which always implied something of a mystery\tsh And
as the court of \textit{Margaret}, as all the world knows,
was at that time a mixture of gallantry and devotion\tsh and
whiskers being as applicable to the one, as the other, the
word naturally stood its ground\tsk it gain’d full\break as much
as it lost; that is, the clergy\break
were for it\tsk the laity were against it\tsk\break
and for the women,\tsh \textit{they} were divided.\tsh\patch{The}

The excellency of the figure and mien of the young Sieur
\textit{de Croix}, was at that time beginning to draw the
attention of the maids of honour towards the terras before
the palace gate, where the guard was mounted. The Lady
\textit{de Baussiere} fell deeply in love with him,\tsh
\textit{La Battarelle} did the same\tsk it was the finest
weather for it, that ever was remembered in\break
\textit{Navarre}\tsk \textit{La Guyol}, \textit{La
Maronette}, \textit{La Sabatiere}, fell in love with the Sieur
\textit{de Croix} also\tsk \textit{La Rebours} and
\textit{La Fosseuse} knew better\tsk \textit{De Croix} had
failed in an attempt to recommend himself to \textit{La
Rebours}; and \textit{La Rebours} and \textit{La
Fosseuse}\break
were inseparable.

The queen of \textit{Navarre} was sitting with her ladies in
the painted bow-window, facing the gate of the second court,
as\break \textit{De Croix} passed through it\tsk He is hand-\catch{some,}
some, said the Lady \textit{Baussiere}.\tsk He has a good
mien, said \textit{La Battarelle}.\tsk He is finely shaped,
said \textit{La Guyol}.\tsk I never saw an officer of the
horse-guards in my life, said \textit{La Maronette}, with
two such legs\tsk Or who stood so well upon them, said
\textit{La Sabatiere}\tsh But he has no whiskers, cried
\textit{La Fosseuse}\tsk Not a pile, said \textit{La
Rebours}.

The queen went directly to her oratory, musing all the way,
as she walked through the gallery, upon the subject; turning
it this way and that way in her fancy\tsh\textit{Ave
Maria}\,✝︎\tsk what can \textit{La Fosseuse} mean? said she,
kneeling down upon the cushion.

\textit{La Guyol}, \textit{La Battarelle}, \textit{La
Maronette}, \textit{La Sabatiere}, retired instantly to
their\break
\stick{chambers\tsk Whiskers! said all four of}\catch{them} them to
themselves, as they bolted their doors on the inside.

The Lady \textit{Carnavallette} was counting her beads with both
hands, unsuspected, under her farthingal\tsh from St.\@
\textit{Antony} down to St.\@ \textit{Ursula} inclusive, not a saint
passed through her fingers without whis\-kers; St.\@ \textit{Francis},
St.\@ \textit{Dominick}, St.\@ \textit{Bennet}, St.\@ \textit{Basil}, St.\@
\textit{Bridget}, had all whis-\break kers.

The Lady \textit{Baussiere} had got into a\break wilderness of conceits,
with moralizing too intricately upon \textit{La Fosseuse}’s
text\tsh She mounted her palfry, her page followed
her\tsk the host passed by\tsk the lady \textit{Baussiere}
rode on.

One denier, cried the order of mercy\break
\tsk one single denier, in behalf of a thou-\catch{sand}
sand patient captives, whose eyes look towards
heaven and you for their re-\break
demption.

\tsh The Lady \textit{Baussiere} rode on.

Pity the unhappy, said a devout, venerable, hoary-headed
man, meekly holding up a box, begirt with iron, in
his\break withered hands\tsh I beg for the unfortunate\tsk
good, my lady, ’tis for a prison\break \tsk for an
hospital\tsk ’tis for an old man\tsk\break a poor man
undone by shipwreck, by suretyship, by fire\tsk I call God
and all his angels to witness\tsk ’tis to cloath the
naked\tsk to feed the hungry\tsk ’tis to comfort the sick
and the broken hearted.

\tsh The Lady \textit{Baussiere} rode on.

A decayed kinsman bowed himself to the ground.\patch{\tsk The}

\tsh The Lady \textit{Baussiere} rode on.

He ran begging bare-headed on one side of her palfry, conjuring
her by the former bonds of friendship, alliance, consanguinity,
\et\textit{c}.\tsk Cousin, aunt, sister, mo\-ther\tsk for
virtue’s sake, for your own, for mine, for Christ’s
sake remember me\tsk\break pity me.

\tsh  The Lady \textit{Baussiere} rode on.

Take hold of my whiskers, said the Lady
\textit{Baussiere}\tsh The page took hold of her palfry. She
dismounted at the\break end of the terrace.

There are some trains of certain ideas which leave prints of
themselves about our eyes and eye-brows; and there is a
consciousness of it, somewhere about the\catch{heart,} heart, which serves
but to make these etchings the stronger\tsk we see, spell,
and put them together without a dictionary.

Ha, ha! hee, hee! cried \textit{La Guyol} and \textit{La Sabatiere},
looking close at each other’s prints\tsh Ho, ho!
cried \textit{La Battarelle} and \textit{Maronette}, doing the
same:\tsk Whist! cried one\tsk ft, ft,\tsk said a
second\tsk hush, quoth a third\tsk poo, poo, replied a
fourth\tsk gramercy! cried the Lady
\textit{Carnavallette};\tsh ’twas she who
bewhisker’d St.\@ \textit{Bridget}.

\textit{La Fosseuse} drew her bodkin from the knot of her hair,
and having traced the outline of a small whisker, with the blunt
end of it, upon one side of her upper lip, put in into
\textit{La Rebours}’s
hand\tsk \textit{La Rebours} shook her head.\patch{The}

The Lady \textit{Baussiere} cough’d thrice into the inside of her
muff\tsk \textit{La Guyol} smiled\break
\tsk Fy, said the Lady
\textit{Baussiere}. The queen of \textit{Navarre} touched her eye with
the tip of her fore finger\tsk as much as to say, I understand
you all.

’Twas plain to the whole court the word was ruined:
\textit{La Fosseuse} had given it a wound, and it was not
the better for passing through all these defiles\tsk
It\break
made a faint stand, however, for a few months; by the
expiration of which,\break the Sieur \textit{de Croix},
finding it high time to leave \textit{Navarre} for want of
whiskers\tsh the word in course became indecent, and
(after a few efforts) absolutely unfit for use.

The best word, in the best language of the best world, must have
suffered un-\catch{der} der such combinations.\tsh The curate of
\textit{d’Estella} wrote a book against them, setting forth the
dangers of accessory ideas, and warning the \textit{Navarois} against
them.

Does not all the world know, said the curate
\textit{d’Estella} at the conclusion of his work, that Noses
ran the same fate some centuries ago in most parts of
\textit{Europe}, which Whiskers have now done in the kingdom of
\textit{Navarre}\tsk The evil indeed spread no farther
then\tsk but have not beds and bolsters, and night-caps and
chamber-pots stood upon the brink of destruction ever since? Are
not trouse, and placket-holes, and pump-handles\tsk and spigots
and faucets, in danger still, from the same
association?\tsk Chastity, by nature, the gentlest of all
affections\tsk give it but its head\tsk ’tis like
a ramping and a roaring lion.\patch{The}

The drift of the curate \textit{d’Estella}’s argument
was not understood.\tsk They ran the scent the wrong
way.\tsk The world bridled his ass at the tail.\tsk And when
the \textit{extreams} of \textsc{delicacy}, and the
\textit{be-\break ginnings} of \textsc{concupiscence}, hold their next
provincial chapter together, they\break may decree that bawdy also.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  II.}

\dropcap{W}{hen} my father received the\break
letter which brought him the\break
\stck{melancholy account of my brother \textit{Bobby}’s}
death, he was busy calculating the expence of
his riding post from \textit{Calais} to \textit{Paris}, and so on to
\textit{Lyons}.

\setlength{\baselineskip}{12.7826pt}  % 21*14 = 294   294/23 \simeq 12.7826 
’Twas a most inauspicious journey; my father having had
every foot of it to travel over again, and his calculation to begin
afresh, when he had almost got\catch{to}
\stick{to the end of it, by \textit{Obadiah}’s opening}
the door to acquaint him the
family was out of yeast\tsk and to ask whether he might not
take the great coach-horse\break
early in the morning, and ride in
search of some.\tsk With all my heart,
\textit{Obadiah},\break
said my father (pursuing his journey)\tsk take the
coach-horse, and welcome.\tsh
But he wants a shoe, poor creature! said
\textit{Obadiah}.\tsh Poor creature! said my uncle
\textit{Toby}, vibrating the note back again, like a string
in unison. Then ride the \textit{Scotch} horse, quoth my
father hastily.\tsk He cannot bear a saddle upon his back,
quoth \textit{Obadiah}, for the whole world.\tsh\break
The devil’s in that horse; then take\break
\stick{\ls{\textsc{Patriot}}, cried my father, and shut}
the door.\tsh \ls{\textsc{Patriot}} is sold, said\break
\textit{Obadiah}.\tsk Here’s for you!\@ cried my father,
making a pause, and looking in\break
my uncle \textit{Toby}’s face, as if the thing had\break
not been a matter of fact.\tsk Your wor-\catch{ship} 
ship ordered me to sell him last \textit{April},\break
said \textit{Obadiah}.\tsk Then go on foot for your
pains, cried my father.\tsk I had much rather walk
than ride, said \textit{Obadiah}, shutting the door.

What plagues! cried my father, go-\break ing on with his
calculation.\tsh But the waters are out, said
\textit{Obadiah},\tsk opening the door again.

Till that moment, my father, who
had a map of \textit{Sanson}’s, and a book of the
post-roads before him, had kept his hand 
upon the head of his compasses, with one
foot of them fixed upon \textit{Nevers}, the last
stage he had paid for\tsk purposing to go
on from that point with his journey and
calculation, as soon as \textit{Obadiah} quitted
the room: but this second attack of \textit{Oba\-diah}’s,
in opening the door and laying 
the whole country under water, was too
much.\tsh He let go his compasses\tsk or ra-\catch{ther} ther with
a mixed motion betwixt accident and anger, he threw them upon the table; and
then there was nothing for\break
\tight{him to do, but to return back to \textit{Calais} (like}
many others) as wise as he had set out.

When the letter was brought into the parlour, which contained
the news of my brother’s death, my father had got forwards
again upon his journey to within a stride of the compasses of the
very same stage of \textit{Nevers}.\tsh By your leave,
Mons.\@
\textit{Sanson}, cried my father, striking the point of his compasses
through \textit{Nevers} into the table,\tsk and nodding to my uncle
\textit{Toby} to see what was in the letter,\break
\tight{\tsk twice of one night, is too much for an}\break
English
gentleman and his son, Mons.\@ \textit{Sanson}, to be turned
back from so lousy a town as \textit{Nevers},\tsk what
think’st thou,\break
\stick{\textit{Toby}, added my father in a sprightly tone.}
\tsk Unless it be a garrison town, said my uncle
\textit{Toby}\tsk for then\tsk I shall be a fool,\catch{said}
said my father, smiling to himself, as\break
long as I live.\tsk So giving a second nod\break
\tsk and keeping his compasses still upon
\textit{Nevers} with one hand, and holding his book of the
post-roads in the other\tsk\break
half calculating and half listening, he\break
leaned forwards upon the table with both\break
elbows, as my uncle \textit{Toby} hummed over\break
the letter.

again.\tsk I dare say not, said my uncle \textit{Toby}, in a
low voice, and fetching a deep sigh from the bottom of
his\catch{heart,} heart, he has been ill enough, poor lad! I’ll answer
for him\tsk for he is dead.


When \textit{Agrippina} was told of her son’s death,
\textit{Tacitus} informs us, that, not being able to moderate the
violence of her passions, she abruptly broke off her
work\break\tsk My
father stuck his compasses into \textit{Nevers}, but so much the
faster.\tsk What contrarieties! his, indeed, was matter of
calculation\tsk \textit{Agrippina}’s must have been quite a
different affair; who else could pretend to reason from
history?

How my father went on, in my opi\-nion, deserves a chapter to

\quad \tsh \quad \tsh \quad And a chapter it\break shall
have, and a devil of a one too\tsk so\break look to yourselves.

’Tis either \textit{Plato}, or \textit{Plutarch}, or
\textit{Sene-\break ca}, or \textit{Xenophon}, or \textit{Epictetus}, or
\textit{Theo}-\catch{\textit{phrastus},} \textit{phrastus}, or \textit{Lucian}\tsk or some one perhaps of
later date\tsk either \textit{Cardan}, or \textit{Bu\-dæus}, or
\textit{Petrarch}, or \textit{Stella}\tsk or possibly it may be some
divine or father of the church, St.\@ \textit{Austin}, or St.\@
\textit{Cyprian}, or \textit{Barnard}, who affirms that it is an
irresistible and natural passion to weep for the loss of our
friends or children\tsk and \textit{Seneca} (I’m positive)
tells us somewhere, that such griefs evacuate themselves best by
that particular channel.\tsk And accord\-ingly we find, that
\textit{David} wept for his son \textit{Absalom}\tsk \textit{Adrian}
for his \textit{Antinous}\tsk\break \textit{Niobe} for her children, and
that \textit{Apollo\-dorus} and \textit{Crito} both shed tears for
\textit{Socra\-tes} before his death.

\tight{My father managed his affliction other}\-wise; and indeed
differently from most men either ancient or modern; for he neither
wept it away, as the \textit{Hebrews} and the \textit{Romans}\tsk or
slept it off, as the \textit{Laplanders}\tsk or hang’d it, as the
\textit{English}, or drowned it, as the \textit{Germans}\tsk nor did
he\catch{curse} curse it, or damn it, or
excommunicate\break it, or rhyme it, or
lillabullero it.\tsh

\tsh  He got rid of it, however.

Will your worships give me leave to
\tighter{squeeze in a story between these two pages?}

When \textit{Tully} was bereft of his dear\break
daughter \textit{Tullia}, at first he laid it to his\break
heart,\tsk he listened to the voice of nature,\break
and modulated his own unto it.\tsk O my\break
\textit{Tullia!} my daughter!  my child!\tsk still, still, still,\tsk ’twas O my
\textit{Tullia!}\tsh my \textit{Tullia!} Methinks I see my
\textit{Tullia}, I hear my \textit{Tullia}, I talk with my
\textit{Tullia}.\tsk\break
But as soon as he began to look into the stores of
philosophy, and consider how many excellent things might
be said upon the occasion\tsk no body upon earth can
conceive, says the great orator, how happy, how joyful it
made me.


My father was as proud of his eloquence as
\ls{\textsc{Marcus Tullius Cicero}}\catch{could} could be for his
life, and for aught I am convinced of to the contrary at
present, with as much reason: it was indeed his strength\tsk
and his weakness too.\tsk His strength\tsk for he was by
nature eloquent,\break
\tsk and his weakness\tsk for he was hourly a
dupe to it; and provided an occasion in life would but
permit him to shew his talents, or say either a wise thing,
a witty, or a shrewd one\tsk (bating the case of a
systematick misfortune)\tsk he had all he wanted.\tsk A
blessing which tied up my father’s tongue, and a misfortune
which let it loose with a good grace, were pretty equal:
sometimes, indeed, the misfortune was the better of the two;
for instance, where the pleasure of the harangue was as
\textit{ten}, and the pain of the misfortune but as
\textit{five}\tsk my father gained half in half, and
consequently was as well again off, as if it had never
befallen him.  

This clue will unravel, what otherwise would seem very
inconsistent in my fa-\catch{ther’s} ther’s domestick character; and it is
this, that, in the provocations arising from the neglects and
blunders of servants, or o\-ther mishaps unavoidable in a family, his
anger, or rather the duration of it, eternally ran counter to all
conjecture.

My father had a favourite little mare, which he had
consigned over to a most beautiful Arabian horse, in order
to have a pad out of her for his own riding: he was sanguine
in all his projects; so talked about his pad every day with
as absolute a security, as if it had been reared, broke,\tsk
and bridled and saddled at his door ready for mounting. By
some neglect or other in \textit{Obadiah}, it so fell out,
that my father’s expectations were answered with nothing
better than a mule, and as ugly a beast of the kind as ever
was produced.

My mother and my uncle \textit{Toby} expect\-ed my father would be
the death of \textit{Oba}-\catch{\textit{diah}} \textit{diah}\tsk and that there never would be an
end of the disaster.\tsh See here! you rascal, cried my
father, pointing to the mule, what you have done!\tsk It
was not me, said \textit{Obadiah}.\tsk How do I know that?
replied my father.

Triumph swam in my father’s eyes, at the
repartee\tsk the \textit{Attic} salt brought water into
them\tsk and so \textit{Obadiah} heard no more about it.

Now let us go back to my brother’s death.

Philosophy has a fine saying for every thing.\tsk For
\textit{Death} it has an entire set;\break
the misery was, they all at once
rushed into my father’s head, that ’twas difficult to
string them together, so as to make any thing of a consistent show out of them.\tsk He
took them as they came.

\stick{\hfill Now my uncle \textit{Toby} knew not that this}
last paragraph was an extract of \textit{Servius
Sulpicius}’s consolatory letter to \textit{Tully}.\tsk He had as
little skill, honest man, in the fragments, as he had in the
whole pieces of antiquity.\tsk And as my father, whilst he
was concerned in the \textit{Turky} trade, had been three
or four different times in the \textit{Levant}, in one of
which he had staid a whole year and an half at
\textit{Zant}, my uncle \textit{Toby} naturally concluded,
that in some one of these periods, he had taken a trip
across the \textit{Archipelago} into \textit{Asia}; and that
all this sailing affair with \textit{Ægina} behind, and
\textit{Megara} before, and \textit{Pyræus} on the right
hand, \etc \etc was nothing more than the true course of my
father’s voyage and reflections.\tsk ’Twas certainly in his
\textit{manner}, and many an undertaking critick would have
built two stories higher upon worse foundations.\tsk And
pray, brother, quoth my uncle \textit{Toby}, laying the end
of his pipe upon my father’s hand\catch{in} in a kindly way of
interruption\tsk but waiting till he finished the
account\tsk what year of our Lord was this?\tsk ’Twas no
year of our Lord, replied my father.\break
\stick{\tsk That’s impossible, cried my uncle \textit{Toby}.}
\stick{\tsk Simpleton! said my father,\tsk ’twas for-}
ty years before Christ was born.

My uncle \textit{Toby} had but two things for it; either to
suppose his brother to be the wandering \textit{Jew}, or that his
misfortunes had disordered his brain.\tsk \lqq May\break
\lqq the Lord God of heaven and earth\break
\lqq protect him and restore him,” said my\break
uncle \textit{Toby}, praying silently for my father, and
with tears in his eyes.

\tsk My father placed the tears to a pro-\break per account, and went
on with his harangue with great spirit.

\indent\lqq There is not such great odds, bro-\break
\lqq ther \textit{Toby}, betwixt good and evil, as\break
\lqq the world imagines\,”\tsh (this way of\catch{setting}
\stick{setting off, by the bye, was not likely to}
\stick{cure my uncle \textit{Toby}’s suspicions.\tsk \lqq
La-}\sic\break
\lqq bour, sorrow, grief, sickness, want, and\break

to himself.\tsh

\indent\lqq My son is dead!\tsk so much the bet-\break
\lqq ter;\tsk ’tis a shame in such a tempest to\break
\lqq have but one anchor.\,”

\indent\lqq But he is gone for ever from us!\tsk\break
\lqq be it so. He is got from under the\break
\lqq hands of his barber before he was bald.\break
\lqq \tsk he is but risen from a feast before \break
\lqq he was surfeited\tsk from a banquet be-\break
\lqq fore he had got drunken.\,”

\indent\lqq The \textit{Thracians} wept when a child\break
\lqq was born\,”\tsk (and we were very near\break
\lqq it, quoth my uncle \textit{Toby})\tsk \lqq and feasted\break
\lqq and made merry when a man went \break
\lqq out of the world; and with reason.\tsk\catch{\lqq Death}
\lqq Death opens the gate of fame, and\break
\lqq shuts the gate of envy after it,\tsk it\break
\lqq unlooses the chain of the captive, and \break
\lqq puts the bondsman’s task into another\break
\lqq man’s hands.\,”

\indent\lqq Shew me the man, who knows what\break
\lqq life is, who dreads it, and I’ll shew thee\break
\lqq a prisoner who dreads his liberty.\,”

Is it not better, my dear brother \textit{Toby},\break
\stick{(for mark\tsk our appetites are but diseases)}\break
\tsk is it not better not to hunger at all, than to eat?\tsk not to thirst, than to
take physick to cure it?

Is it not better to be freed from cares and agues, from love and
melancholy, and the other hot and cold fits of life, than like
a galled traveller, who comes weary to his inn, to be bound to
begin his journey afresh?

There is no terror, brother \textit{Toby}, in its looks, but what
it borrows from groans\catch{and} and convulsions\tsk and the blowing of
noses, and the wiping away of tears with the bottoms of curtains, in
a dying man’s room.\tsk Strip it of these, what is
it\tsk ’Tis better in battle than in bed, said my uncle
\textit{Toby}.\tsk Take away its herses, its mutes, and its
mourning,\tsk its plumes, scutcheons, and other mechanic
aids\tsk What is it?\tsk \textit{Better in battle!} continued my
father, smiling, for he had absolutely forgot my brother
\textit{Bobby}\tsk ’tis terrible no way\tsk for consider,
brother \textit{Toby},\tsk when we \textit{are}\tsk death is
\textit{not};\tsk and when death \textit{is}\tsk we are \textit{not}.
My uncle \textit{Toby} laid down his pipe to consider the
proposition; my father’s eloquence was too rapid to stay for
any man\tsk away it went,\break\tsk and hurried my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s ideas along with it.\tsh

For this reason, continued my father, ’tis worthy to
recollect, how little alte\-ration in great men, the
approaches of\catch{death}
death have made.\tsk \textit{Vespasian} died in a 
jest upon his close stool\tsk \textit{Galba} with a\break
sentence\tsk \textit{Septimus Severus} in a dispatch\break
\tsk \textit{Tiberius} in dissimulation, and \textit{Cæsar Augustus} in a compliment.\tsk I hope
’twas a sincere one\tsk quoth my uncle \textit{Toby}.


\tsk ’Twas to his wife,\tsk said my father.

this, like the gilded dome which covers in the fabrick\tsk

\dropcap{M}{y} mother was going very ginger-\break
ly in the dark along the passage\break
which led to the parlour, as my uncle \textit{Toby}
pronounced the word \textit{wife}.\tsk ’Tis a shrill,
penetrating sound of itself, and \textit{Obadiah} had helped
it by leaving the door a little a-jar, so that my mother
heard enough of it, to imagine herself the subject of the
conversation; so laying the edge of her finger across her
two lips\tsk holding in her breath, and bending her head a
little downwards, with a twist of her neck\tsk (not towards
the door, but from it, by which means her ear was brought to
the chink)\tsk she listened with all her powers:\tsh the
listening slave, with the Goddess of Silence at his back,
could not have given a finer thought for an intaglio.\patch{In}

In this attitude I am determined to let her stand for five
minutes: till I bring up the affairs of the kitchen (as
\textit{Rapin} does those of the church) to the same\break period.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  VI.}

\dropcap{T}{hough} in one sense, our family\break
was certainly a simple machine, as\break
it consisted of a few wheels; yet there\break
was thus much to be said for it, that
these wheels were set in motion by so many
different springs, and acted one upon the
other from such a variety of strange
principles and impulses,\tsh that though
it was a simple machine, it had all the
honour and advantages of a complex
one,\tsh and a number of as odd movements
within it, as ever were beheld in the
inside of a \textit{Dutch} silk-mill.

Amongst these there was one, I am going to speak of, in which,
perhaps, it\catch{was}
\stck{was not altogether so singular, as in many} others; and it
was this, that whatever motion, debate, harangue, dialogue,
pro\-ject, or dissertation, was going forwards in the parlour,
there was generally ano\-ther at the same time, and upon the
same subject, running parallel along with it in the kitchen.

Now to bring this about, whenever an extraordinary message, or
letter, was delivered in the parlour,\tsk or a discourse suspended
till a servant went out\tsk or the lines of discontent were
observed to hang upon the brows of my father or mother\break
\tsk or, in short, when any thing was supposed to be upon
the tapis worth knowing or listening to, ’twas the rule to
leave the door, not absolutely shut, but somewhat a-jar\tsk
as it stands just now,\tsk which, under covert of the bad
hinge, (and that possibly might be one of the many reasons
why it was never mended) it was not difficult to manage; by
which means,\catch{in}
\stick{\tight{in all these cases, a passage was generally}}
left, not indeed as wide as the \textit{Dardanells}, but
wide enough, for all that, to carry on as much of this
windward trade, as was sufficient to save my father the
trouble of governing his house;\tsk my mother at this moment
stands profiting by it.\tsk \textit{Obadiah} did the same
thing, as soon as he had left the letter upon the table
which brought the news of my brother’s death; so that before
my father had well got over his surprize, and entered upon
his harangue,\tsk had \textit{Trim} got upon his legs, to
speak his sentiments upon the subject.

A curious observer of nature, had he been worth the inventory of
all \textit{Job}’s\break stock\tsk though by the bye, \textit{your
curious observers are seldom worth a groat}\tsk would have
given the half of it, to have heard Corporal \textit{Trim} and my
father, two orators so contrasted by nature and education,
haranguing over the same bier.\patch{My}

My father a man of deep reading\tsk prompt
memory\tsk with \textit{Cato}, and \textit{Seneca}, and
\textit{Epictetus}, at his fingers ends.\tsk

The corporal\tsk with nothing\tsk to remember\tsk of no
deeper reading than his muster-roll\tsk or greater names at his
finger’s end, than the contents of it.

The one proceeding from period to period, by metaphor and
allusion, and striking the fancy as he went along, (as men
of wit and fancy do) with the entertainment and pleasantry
of his pictures and images.

The other, without wit or antithesis,\break or point, or turn,
this way or that; but leaving the images on one side, and
the picture on the other, going strait for-\break wards as nature
could lead him, to the heart. O~\textit{Trim!} would to
heaven thou had’st a better historian!\tsk would!\tsk thy
historian had a better pair of breeches!\catch{\tsh O}

\quad\tsh My young master in \textit{London} is dead!
said \textit{Obadiah}.\tsk

\tsk  A green sattin night-gown of my mother’s,
which had been twice scoured, was the first idea which
\textit{Obadiah}’s exclamation brought into
\textit{Susannah}’s head.\tsk\break 
\stck{Well might \textit{Locke} write a chapter upon the}
imperfections of words.\tsk Then, quoth\break
\tight{\textit{Susannah}, we must all go into mourning.}\break
\tsk But note a second time: the word
\textit{mou\-rning}, notwithstanding \textit{Susannah}
made\break use of it
herself\tsk failed also of doing its office; it excited not one
single idea, tinged either with grey or black,\tsk all was
green.\tsh The green sattin night-gown hung there
still.

\tsk O! ’twill be the death of my poor mistress, cried
\textit{Susannah}.\tsk My mother’s\catch{whole} whole wardrobe
followed.\tsk What a procession! her red damask,\tsk her
orange-\break
\stck{tawny,\tsk her white and yellow lutestrings,}\break
\tsk her brown taffata,\tsk her bone-laced caps, her bed-gowns, and
comfortable\break
under-petticoats.\tsk Not a rag was left
behind.\tsh \lqq\textit{No,\tsk she will never look up
again},\,” said \textit{Susannah}.

We had a fat foolish scullion\tsk my father, I think, kept
her for her simplicity;\break\tsk she had been all autumn struggling
with a dropsy.\tsk He is dead! said \textit{Obadiah},\tsk he is
certainly dead!\tsk So am not I, said the foolish scullion.

\tsh  Here is sad news, \textit{Trim!} cried
\textit{Susannah}, wiping her eyes as \textit{Trim} step’d 
into the kitchen,\tsk master \textit{Bobby} is dead and
\textit{buried},\tsk the funeral was an interpolation of
\textit{Susannah}’s,\tsk we shall have all to go into
mourning, said \textit{Susannah}.\patch{I hope}

I hope not, said \textit{Trim}.\tsk You hope not!\break cried
\textit{Susannah} earnestly.\tsk The mourning ran not in
\textit{Trim}’s head, whatever it did in
\textit{Susannah}’s.\tsk I hope\tsk said \textit{Trim},
explaining himself, I hope in God the news is not true. I heard the
letter read with my own ears, answered \textit{Obadiah;} and we shall
have a terrible piece of work of it in stubbing the
ox-moor.\tsk Oh! he’s dead, said \textit{Susannah}.\tsk As
sure, said the scullion, as I am alive.

I lament for him from my heart and my soul, said \textit{Trim},
fetching a sigh.\tsk\break 
Poor creature!\tsk poor boy! poor
gentleman!

\tsk He was alive last \textit{Whitsontide}, said the
coachman.\tsk \textit{Whitsontide!} alas! cried
\textit{Trim}, extending his right arm, and fall-\break ing
instantly into the same attitude in which he read the
sermon,\tsk what is \textit{Whitsontide}, \textit{Jonathan},
(for that was the coachman’s name), or \textit{Shrovetide},
or any\catch{tide} tide or time past, to this? Are we not here now,
continued the corporal (striking the end of his stick
perpendicularly upon the floor, so as to give an idea of
health and stability)\tsk and are we not\tsk 
\stick{(dropping his hat upon the ground)}
gone! in a moment!\tsk ’Twas infinitely
striking! \textit{Susannah} burst into a flood of tears.\tsk
We are not stocks and stones.\tsk\break
\textit{Jonathan}, \textit{Obadiah}, the cook-maid,
all\break melted.\tsk The foolish fat
scullion herself, who was scouring a fish-kettle upon her
knees, was rous’d with it.\tsk The whole kitchen crouded
about the corporal.

Now, as I perceive plainly, that the \tight{preservation of our
constitution in church} and state,\tsk and possibly the
preservation of the whole world\tsk or what is the same thing,
the distribution and balance of its property and power, may in time
to come depend greatly upon the right 
understanding of this stroke of the corpo-\catch{ral’s} ral’s
eloquence\tsk I do demand your attention,\tsk your worships and
reverences, for any ten pages together, take them where you will in
any other part of the work, shall sleep for it at your ease.

\enlargethispage\baselineskip
I said, “we were not stocks and stones”\break
\tsk ’tis very well. I should have added,\break 
nor are we angels, I wish we were,\tsk but\break
men cloathed with bodies, and governed\break
by our imaginations;\tsk and what a jun\-ketting piece of work of it
there is, betwixt these and our seven senses, especially
some of them, for my own part, I own it, I am ashamed to
confess. Let it suffice to affirm, that of all the senses,
the eye, (for I absolutely deny the touch, though most of
your \textit{Barbati}, I know,\break
are for it) has the quickest
commerce with the soul,\tsk gives a smarter stroke, and
leaves something more inexpressible upon the fancy, than
words can either convey\tsk or sometimes get rid of.\patch{\tsh I’ve}

\tsk I’ve gone a little about\tsk no matter,
’tis for health\tsk let us only carry it back in our mind
to the mortality of \textit{Trim}’s hat\tsk “Are we not
here now,\tsk and gone in a moment?”\tsk There was
nothing in the sentence\tsk ’twas one of your self-evident
truths we have the advantage of hearing every day; and if
\textit{Trim} had not trusted more to his hat than his head\tsk he
made nothing at all of it.

\enlargethispage\baselineskip
\tsh  “Are we not here now;”\tsk\break
continued the corporal, “and are we not”\break
\tsk (dropping his hat plumb upon the ground\tsk and
pausing, before he pronounced the word)\tsk “gone! in a
moment?” The descent of the hat was as if a heavy lump of
clay had been kneaded into the crown of it.\tsh Nothing
could have expressed the sentiment of mortality, of which it
was the type and fore-runner, like it,\tsk his hand seemed
to vanish from under it,\tsk it fell dead,\tsk the
corporal’s eye fix’d upon it, as upon a\catch{corps,} corps,\tsk and
\textit{Susannah} burst into a flood of tears.

\vskip-3pt

Now\tsk Ten thousand, and ten thousand times ten thousand
(for matter and motion are infinite) are the ways by\break
which a hat may be dropped upon the ground, without any
effect.\tsk Had he

\stick{skimmed it, or squirted, or let it slip or}
fall in any
possible direction under hea\-ven,\tsk or in the best

like a goose\tsk like a puppy\tsk like an ass\tsk or in
doing it, or even after he had done, had he looked like a
fool,\tsk like a ninny\tsk like a nicompoop\sic\tsk it had
fail’d, and the effect upon the heart had been lost.

\dropcap{S}{tay}\tsh I have a small account to
settle with the reader, before \textit{Trim} can go on with his
harangue.\tsk It shall be done in two minutes.

Amongst many other book-debts, all of which I shall discharge in
due time,\tsk I own myself a debtor to the world for two
items,\tsk a chapter upon \textit{chamber-maids and button-holes},
which, in the former part of my work, I promised and\catch{fully} fully intended
to pay off this year: but some of your worships and reverences
telling me, that the two subjects, especially so connected
together, might endanger the morals of the world,\tsk I pray the
chapter upon chamber-maids and\break button-holes may be forgiven
me,\tsk and 
\stick{that they will accept of the last chapter}
\stick{in lieu of it; which is nothing, an’t please}

From the strange mode of \textit{Cornelius}’s death, my father

one was able to set out with so full a sail, and in so swelling
a tide of heroic loftiness upon the occasion, as my father was.
Not a period in \textit{Socrates}’s oration, which closed with a
shorter word than \textit{transmigration}, or
\textit{annihilation},\tsk or a worse thought in the middle of
it than \textit{to be\tsk or not to be},\break
\stick{\tsk the entering upon a new and untried}

got to \textit{Rome},\tsk from \textit{Rome} to

but three days journey distant, so down\break
the \textit{Nile} directly to \textit{Alexandria}, where\break
the \ls{\textsc{sentiment}} would be landed at the\break

\dropcap{T}{he} first thing which entered my\break
father’s head, after affairs were a\break
little settled in the family, and \textit{Susannah} had got possession of my mother’s
green sattin night-gown,\tsk was to sit down coolly, after the
example of \textit{Xenophon}, and write a
\textsc{Tristra}-\textit{pædia}, or system of education
for me; collecting first for that purpose his own scattered
thoughts, counsels, and notions; and binding them together, so as
to form an \textsc{institute} for \tight{the government of my
childhood and ado-}\catch{le\ scence.\rlap{\quad\club}} lescence. I was my father’s last
stake\tsk he had lost my brother \textit{Bobby} entirely,\tsk he
had lost, by his own computation,\break full three fourths of
me\tsk that is, he had been unfortunate in his three first great
casts for me\tsk my geniture, nose, and name,\tsk there was but
this one left; and accordingly my father gave himself up to it with
as much devotion as ever my uncle \textit{Toby} had done to his
doctrine of projectils.\tsk The difference between them was, that my uncle \textit{Toby} drew his whole
know\-ledge of projectils from \textit{Nicholas\break Tartaglia}\tsk My
father spun his, every thread of it, out of his own brain,\tsk or
reeled and cross-twisted what all other spinners and spinsters had
spun before him, that ’twas pretty near the same torture to
him.

\enlargethispage\baselineskip
In about three years, or something more, my father had got
advanced almost into the middle of his work.\tsk Like all other
writers, he met with disappoint-\catch{ments.} 
ments.\tsk He imagined he should be\break
able to bring whatever he had to say,\break
into so small a compass, that when it\break
was finished and bound, it might be\break
\stick{rolled up in my mother’s hussive.\tsk Mat-}
ter grows under our hands.\tsk Let no man say,\tsk “Come\tsk I’ll write a \textit{duodecimo}.”

My father gave himself up to it, however, with the most painful
diligence,\break
proceeding step by step in every line, with the same
kind of caution and cir\-cumspection (though I cannot say upon quite
so religious a principle) as was used by \textit{John de la Casse},
the lord archbishop of \textit{Benevento}, in compassing his
\textit{Galatea};\break in which his Grace of \textit{Benevento} spent near
forty years of his life; and when the thing came out, it was not of
above half the size or the thickness of a \textit{Rider}’s\break
Almanack.\tsk How the holy man managed the affair, unless he
spent the great\-est part of his time in combing his whis-\catch{kers,} kers, or
playing at \textit{primero} with his chaplain,\tsk would pose any
mortal not let into the true secret;\tsk and therefore ’tis
worth explaining to the world, was it only for the encouragement of
those few in it, who write not so much to be fed\tsk as to\break be
famous.

I own had \textit{John de la Casse}, the archbishop of
\textit{Benevento}, for whose memory (notwithstanding his
\textit{Galatea}) I retain the highest veneration,\tsk had he
been, Sir, a slender clerk\tsk of dull wit\tsk slow
parts\tsk costive head, and so forth,\tsk he and his
\textit{Galatea} might have jogged on\break together to the age of
\textit{Methuselah} for\break me,\tsk the phænomenon had not been
worth a parenthesis.\tsk

But the reverse of this was the truth: \textit{John de la Casse}
was a genius of fine parts and fertile fancy; and yet with all
these great advantages of nature, which should\catch{have} have pricked him
forwards with his \textit{Ga\-latea}, he lay under an impuissance at
the same time of advancing above a line and a half in the compass
of a whole summer’s day: this disability in his Grace arose
from an opinion he was afflicted \stick{with,\tsk which opinion was
this,\tsk \textit{viz}. that} whenever a Christian was writing a
book \stick{(not for his private amusement, but)} where his intent and
purpose was, \textit{bonâ fide}, to print and publish it to the
world, his first thoughts were always the temptations of the evil
one.\tsk This was the\break state of ordinary writers: but when a
personage of venerable character and\break high station, either in church
or state, once turned author,\tsk he maintained, that from the
very moment he took pen in hand\tsk all the devils in hell broke
out of their holes to cajole him.\tsk ’Twas Term-time with
them,\tsk every thought, first and last, was captious;\tsk how spe-\catch{cious}
cious and good soever,\tsk ’twas all one;\break\tsk in whatever form or
colour it present\-ed itself to the imagination,\tsk ’twas still\break 
a stroke of one or other of ’em levelled\break at him,
and was to be fenced off.\tsk So\break that the life of a writer,
whatever he\break might fancy to the contrary, was not so much a state of
\textit{composition}, as a state of \textit{warfare;} and his probation
in it, precisely that of any other man militant upon\break
earth,\tsk both depending alike, not half so much upon the
degrees of his \textsc{wit}\tsk\break as his \textsc{resistance}.

My father was hugely pleased with this theory of \textit{John de la
Casse}, archbi-\break shop of \textit{Benevento;} and (had it not\break cramped
him a little in his creed) I believe would have given ten of the best
acres in the \textit{Shandy} estate, to have been the broacher of
it.\tsk How far my father actually believed in the devil, will be seen,
when I come to speak of my fa-\catch{ther’s} ther’s religious notions, in the
progress of this work: ’tis enough to say here, as he could not have the
honour of it, in the literal sense of the doctrine\tsk he\break took up with
the allegory of it;\tsk and would often say, especially when his pen was
a little retrograde, there was as much good meaning, truth, and
knowledge,\break couched under the veil of \textit{John de la\break Casse}’s
parabolical representation,\tsk as was to be found in any one poetic
fiction or mystick record of antiquity.\tsk Preju\-dice of education, he
would say, \textit{is the devil},\tsk and the multitudes of them which
we suck in with our mother’s milk\tsk \textit{are the devil and
all.}\tsh We are haunted with them, brother \textit{Toby}, in all our
lucubrations and researches; and was a man fool enough to submit tamely
to what they obtruded upon him,\tsk what would his book be?
Nothing,\tsk he wou’d add, throwing his pen away with a vengeance,
\stick{\tsk nothing but a farrago of the clack of}\catch{nurses,} nurses, and of the nonsense of
the old women (of both sexes) throughout the kingdom.

This is the best account I am determined to give of the slow
progress my father made in his \textit{Tristra-pædia;} at
which (as I said) he was three years, and something more,
indefatigably at work, and\break
at last, had scarce completed, by his\break
own reckoning, one half of his undertaking: the misfortune was,
that I was all that time totally neglected and abandoned to my
mother; and what was almost as bad, by the very delay, the first
part of the work, upon which my father had spent the most of his
pains, was rendered entirely useless,\tsh every day a\break page
or two became of no conse-\break quence.\tsh

\tsh Certainly it was ordained as a scourge upon the
pride of human wis-\catch{dom,}
dom, That the wisest of us all, should\break thus outwit ourselves, and
eternally fore\-go our purposes in the intemperate act of pursuing them.

In short my father was so long in all his acts of resistance,\tsk or in
other words,\break\tsk he advanced so very slow with his work, and I began to
live and get forwards at such a rate, that if an event \stick{had not
happened,\tsh which, when we} get to it, if it can be told with decency,
shall not be concealed a moment from the reader\tsh I verily believe, I
had put by my father, and left him drawing a sun-dial, for no better
purpose than to be buried under ground.

and as the sash pullies, when the lead was gone, were of no kind of use,
he had taken them away also, to make a couple of wheels for one of their
carriages.

\tight{He had dismantled every sash window}\break in my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s house long before, in the very same
way,\tsk though not always in the same order; for sometimes the\break
pullies had been wanted, and not the lead,\tsk so then he began
with the pullies,\break\tsk and the pullies being picked out, then\catch{the} the
lead became useless,\tsk and so the lead went to pot too.

\tsh  A great \textsc{moral} might be picked
handsomly out of this, but I have not time\tsk ’tis enough
to say, wherever the demolition began, ’twas equally fatal to
the sash window.

\dropcap{T}{he} corporal had not taken his
measures so badly in this stroke of\break
artilleryship, but that he might have kept the matter entirely to
himself, and left \textit{Susannah} to have sustained the whole weight
of the attack, as she could;\tsk\break
true courage is not content with coming off so.\tsh The corporal,
whether as general or comptroller of the train,\tsk ’twas no matter,\tsh
had done that, without which, as he imagined, the misfortune could never
have happened,\tsk \textit{at least in}\catch{Susannah’\textit{s}}
Susannah’\textit{s hands};\tsh
How would your honours have behaved?\tsh He determined at once, not to
take shelter behind \textit{Susannah},\tsk but to give it; and with this
resolution upon his mind, he marched upright into the parlour, to lay
the whole \textit{manœuvre} before my uncle \textit{Toby}.

My uncle \textit{Toby} had just then been\break
giving \textit{Yorick} an account of the Battle of \textit{Steenkirk},
and of the strange conduct of count \textit{Solmes} in ordering the foot
to halt, and the horse to march where it could not act; which was
directly contrary to the king’s commands, and proved the loss of the
day.

There are incidents in some families so pat to the purpose of
what is going to follow,\tsk they are scarce exceeded by the
invention of a dramatic writer;\tsk I mean of ancient
days.\tsh\patch{\textit{Trim}}

\textit{Trim}, by the help of his forefinger, laid flat upon the
table, and the edge of his hand striking a-cross it at right angles,
made a shift to tell his story so, that priests and virgins might
have listened to it;\tsk and the story being told,\break\tsk the
dialogue went on as follows.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  XXI.}

\quad\tsh  I would be picquetted to death, cried
the corporal, as he concluded \textit{Susannah}’s story, before
I would suffer the woman to come to any harm,\tsk ’twas my
fault, an’ please your honour,\tsk not hers.

Corporal \textit{Trim}, replied my uncle \textit{Toby}, putting on
his hat which lay upon the\break table,\tsh if any thing can be said to be a
fault, when the service absolutely requires it should be
done,\tsk ’tis I certainly who deserve the blame,\tsk you
obeyed your orders.\patch{Had}

Had count \textit{Solmes}, \textit{Trim}, done the\break
same at the battle of \textit{Steenkirk}, said \textit{Yo\-rick}, drolling a little upon the
corporal, who had been run over by a dragoon in the retreat,\tsh he had
saved thee;\tsh\break
Saved! cried \textit{Trim}, interrupting
\textit{Yorick}, and finishing the sentence for him after his own
fashion,\tsh he had saved five\break
battalions, an please your reverence,\break
every soul of them:\tsh there was \textit{Cutt}’s,\break
\tsk continued the corporal, clapping the 
forefinger of his right hand upon the\break
thumb of his left, and counting round his hand,\tsh there was
\textit{Cutt}’s,\tsh \textit{Mackay}’s,\tsh \textit{Angus}’s,\tsh
\textit{Graham}’s,\tsh and \textit{Leven}’s, all cut to pieces;\tsh and
so\break had the \textit{English} life-guards too, had it\break
not been for some regiments upon the right, who marched up boldly to their relief, and
received the enemy’s fire in their faces, before any one of their own
platoons discharged a musket,\tsh they’ll go to heaven for it,\tsk added
\textit{Trim}.\tsk\catch{\textit{Trim}}
\textit{Trim} is right, said my uncle \textit{Toby}, nod\-ding to
\textit{Yorick},\tsh he’s perfectly right.\break
What signified his marching the horse, 
\stck{continued the corporal, where the ground}
was so strait, and the \textit{French} had such a
nation of hedges, and copses, and ditches, 
and fell’d trees laid this way and that to
cover them; (as they always have.)\tsh
Count \textit{Solmes} should have sent us,\tsh 
we would have fired muzzle to muzzle
with them for their lives.\tsh There was
\stick{nothing to be done for the horse:\tsh}
he had his foot shot off however for his
pains, continued the corporal, the very
next campaign at \textit{Landen}.\tsk Poor \textit{Trim}
got his wound there, quoth my uncle
\textit{Toby}.\tsh ’Twas owing, an please your
honour, entirely to count \textit{Solmes},\tsh\break
had we drub’d them soundly at \textit{Steen-\break kirk},
they would not have fought us at 
\textit{Landen}.\tsh Possibly not,\tsh \textit{Trim}, said 
my uncle \textit{Toby;}\tsh though if they have
the advantage of a wood, or you give\catch{them}
them a moment’s time to intrench themselves, they are a nation
which will pop and pop for ever at you.\tsh There is no way but

\textit{Trim}.\tsh Horse and foot, said my uncle
\textit{Toby}.\tsh Helter skelter, said \textit{Trim}.\tsh Right

shouted the corporal;\break\tsh the battle raged,\tsh
\textit{Yorick} drew his chair a little to one side for safety,
and after a moment’s pause, my uncle \textit{Toby} sinking his
voice a note,\tsk resumed the discourse as follows.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  XXII.}

\dropcap{K}{ing} \textit{William}, said my uncle
\textit{Toby},\break addressing himself to \textit{Yorick}, was so
terribly provoked at count \textit{Solmes} for disobeying his orders,
that he would not suffer him to come into his presence\catch{for}
for many months after.\tsh I fear,
answered \textit{Yorick}, the squire will be as\break 
much provoked at the corporal, as the
King at the count.\tsh But ’twould be\break
singularly hard in this case, continued
he, if corporal \textit{Trim}, who has behaved 
so diametrically opposite to count \textit{Solmes}, 
should have the fate to be rewarded with 
the same disgrace:\tsh too oft in this 
world, do things take that train.\tsh\break 
I would spring a mine, cried my uncle
\textit{Toby}, rising up,\tsh and blow up my 
fortifications, and my house with them,
and we would perish under their ruins,
ere I would stand by and see it.\tsh
\textit{Trim} directed a slight,\tsh but a

the chapter ends.  \vfill

befell me: it summoned up my mother instantly into the nursery,\tsk so
that \textit{Susannah} had but just time to make her escape down the

Now, though I was old enough to have told the story
myself,\tsk and young\break
enough, I hope, to have done it without\break
malignity; yet \textit{Susannah}, in passing by the kitchen, for fear
of accidents, had left it in short-hand with the cook\tsk the
cook had told it with a commentary to \textit{Jonathan}, and
\textit{Jonathan} to \textit{Obadiah;} so that by the time my father

One would imagine from this\tsh (though for my own part I somewhat

the most original and entertaining one in the whole book;\tsk and that
is\break
the \textit{chapter upon sash-windows}, with a bitter
\textit{Philippick} at the end of it, upon the forgetfulness of
chamber-maids.\tsk\break
I have but two reasons for thinking otherwise.

First, Had the matter been taken into
\stck{consideration, before the event happened,}
my father certainly would have nailed up the sash
window for good an’ all;\tsk which, considering with what
difficulty he composed books,\tsk he might have done with ten
times less trouble, than he could have wrote the chapter: this
argument I foresee holds good against his writing a chapter, even
after the event;\catch{but}
\stick{but ’tis obviated under the second reason,}
which I have the honour to offer to the world in support of my
opinion, that my father did not write the chapter upon sash-windows
and chamber-pots, at the time supposed,\tsk and it is this.


\tsh  That, in order to render the

myself.

\lqq poising himself on the mounting side,\break
\lqq he most nimbly (with his short sword\break
\lqq by this thigh) shifting his feet in the\catch{\lqq stirrup}

\lqq saddle, standing upright, with his\break
\lqq back turned towards his horse’s head,\break
\lqq \tsk Now (said he) my case goes forward.\break
\lqq Then suddenly in the same posture\break
\lqq wherein he was, he fetched a gambol\break
\lqq upon one foot, and turning to the left-\break
\lqq hand, failed not to carry his body per-\break
\lqq fectly round, just into his former po-\break
\lqq sition, without missing one jot.\tsh\break
\lqq Ha!  said \textit{Tripet}, I will not do that\break
\lqq at this time,\tsk and not without cause.\break
\lqq Well, said \textit{Gymnast}, I have failed,\tsk\break

\lqq side back, without \textit{touching any thing},\break
\lqq he brought himself betwixt the horse’s\break
\lqq two ears, and then giving himself a\break

\lqq the crupper\tsh ”

(This can’t be fighting, said my uncle\break
\textit{Toby}.\tsh The corporal shook his head\break
at it.\tsh Have patience, said \textit{Yorick}.)

\dropcap{T}{he} first thirty pages, said my\break
father, turning over the leaves,\tsk\break
are a little dry; and as they are not closely connected with the
subject,\tsh for the present we’ll pass them by: ’tis a prefa-\catch{tory} tory
introduction, continued my father, or an introductory preface (for I am
not determined which name to give it) upon political or civil
government; the foundation of which being laid in the first conjunction
betwixt male and female,\break
for procreation of the species\tsh I was
insensibly led into it.\tsh ’Twas natural, said \textit{Yorick}.

The original of society, continued my father, I’m
satisfied is, what \textit{Politian}\break tells
us, \textit{i}.\@ \textit{e}.\@ merely conjugal;
and no\-thing more than the getting together of one
man and one woman;\tsk to which, (according to
\textit{Hesiod}) the philosopher\break adds a
servant:\tsk but supposing in the \stck{first beginning
there were no men servants} born\tsh he lays the
foundation of it,\break in a man,\tsk a woman\tsk and a
bull.\tsh I believe ’tis an ox, quoth
\textit{Yorick}, quoting the passage ({\small οἶκον
μὲν πρώτισα\sic, γυνᾶικα\break τε, βοῦν τ᾽ ἀροτηρα}.)\tsh A
bull must have\catch{given} given more trouble than
his head was worth.\tsh But there is a better
reason still, said my father (dipping his pen\break into
his ink) for, the ox being the most patient of
animals, and the most useful withal in tilling the
ground for their nourishment,\tsk was the properest
instrument, and emblem too, for the new join\-ed
couple, that the creation could have associated
with them.\tsk And there is a stronger reason,

ox.\tsk My father had not power to take his pen out
of his ink-horn, till he had heard my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s reason.\tsk For when the ground was
til\-led, said my uncle \textit{Toby}, and made worth
inclosing, then they began to secure it by walls
and ditches, which was the origin of
fortification.\tsh True, true, dear \textit{Toby},
cried my father, striking out the bull, and putting
the ox in his place.

My father gave \textit{Trim} a nod, to snuff the candle, and
resumed his discourse.\patch{\tsh I}

\tsh I enter upon this speculation, said my father
carelessly, and half shutting the book, as he went on,\tsk merely to
shew the foundation of the natural relation between a father and
his child; the right and jurisdiction over whom he acquires these
several ways\tsk

1st, by marriage.

2d, by adoption.

3d, by legitimation.

And 4th, by procreation; all which I consider in their
order.

I lay a slight stress upon one of them; replied
\textit{Yorick}\tsh the act, especially where it ends there,
in my opinion lays as little obligation upon the child, as it
conveys power to the father.\tsk You are wrong,\tsk said my
father argutely, and 
\stick{for this plain reason \astfill}\catch{\astW3}
\stick{\astfill}
\stick{\astfill.\tsk I own,}
added my father, that the offspring, up-\break 
on this account, is not so under the\break
power and jurisdiction of the \textit{mother}.\tsk\break
But
the reason, replied \textit{Yorick}, equally holds good for
her.\tsk She is under authority herself, said my
father:\tsk and\break
besides, continued my father, nodding his head, and laying his finger
upon the side of his nose, as he assigned his reason,\tsk \textit{she is
not the principal agent}, Yorick.\tsk In what? quoth my uncle
\textit{Toby}, stopping his pipe.\tsk Though by all\break means, added my
father (not attending to my uncle \textit{Toby}), \lqq \textit{The son

\lqq\textit{her respect},\,” as you may read, \textit{Yorick},\break
at large in the first book of the Institutes of \textit{Justinian}, at

\initial{O}{Blessed} health! cried my father,
making an exclamation, as he\break
turned over the leaves to the next
chapter,\tsk thou art before all gold and treasure; ’tis thou who
enlargest the soul,\tsk and openest all it’s powers to receive
instruction and to relish virtue.\tsk He that has thee, has
little more to wish for;\tsk and he that is so wretched as to
want thee,\tsk wants every thing with thee.\etp

I have concentrated all that can be said upon this important
head, said my\catch{father,} father, into a very little room, therefore
we’ll read the chapter quite thro’.

My father read as follows.

\indent\lqq The whole secret of health depend-\break
\lqq ing upon the due contention for ma-\break
\lqq stery betwixt the radical heat and the\break
\lqq radical moisture\,”\tsk You have proved
that matter of fact, I suppose, above,\break said \textit{Yorick}. Sufficiently,
replied my father.


In saying this, my father shut the\break book,\tsk not as if he resolved to read no
more of it, for he kept his fore-finger in the chapter:\tsh nor pettishly,\tsk for
he shut the book slowly; his thumb resting, when he had done it, upon the upper-side
of the cover, as his three fingers supported the lower-side of it, without the least
compressive violence.\tsh\patch{I}

I have demonstrated the truth of that point, quoth my father,
nodding to \textit{Yorick}, most sufficiently in the preceding
chapter.

Now could the man in the moon be told, that a man in the earth
had wrote a chapter, sufficiently demonstrating, That the secret of
all health depended upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the
\textit{radical heat} and the \textit{radical moisture},\tsk and that
he had managed the point so well, that there was not one single
word wet or dry upon radical heat or radical moisture, throughout
the whole chapter,\tsk or a single syllable in it, \textit{pro} or
\textit{con}, directly or indirectly, upon the contention betwixt
these two powers in any part of the animal
œconomy\tsh

\indent\lqq O thou eternal maker of all
beings!”\break
\tsk he would cry, striking his breast with
his right hand, (in case he had one)\tsk\catch{\lqq Thou}
\lqq Thou whose power and goodness can\break
\lqq enlarge the faculties of thy creatures to\break
\lqq this infinite degree of excellence and\break

\dropcap{W}{ith} two strokes, the one at\break
\textit{Hippocrates}, the other at Lord\break
\textit{Verulam}, did my father achieve it.

The stroke at the prince of physicians, with which he began, was
no more than a short insult upon his sorrowful complaint of the
\textit{Ars longa},\tsk and \textit{Vita brevis}.\break
\tsh Life short, cried my father,\tsk and the art of healing tedious! And
who are we to thank for both, the one and the other, but the
ignorance of quacks themselves,\tsk and the stage-loads of
chymical nostrums, and peripatetic lumber, with\catch{which,} which, in all
ages, they have first flatter’d the world, and at last
deceived it.

\tsh  O my lord \textit{Verulam!} cried my\break father,
turning from \textit{Hippocrates}, and\break
making his second stroke at him, as the principal of nostrum-mongers, and the
fittest to be made an example of to the rest,\tsh What shall I say to thee, my great
lord \textit{Verulam?} What shall I say to thy internal spirit,\tsk thy opium,\tsk
thy salt-petre,\tsh thy greasy unctions,\tsk thy daily purges,\tsk thy nightly
glisters, and\break succedaneums?


\tsh  My father was never at a loss what to say to any
man, upon any subject; and had the least occasion for the exordium
of any man breathing: how he dealt with his lordship’s
opinion,\tsh\break you shall see;\tsk but when\tsk I

opinion was.\patch{\ls{CHAP}.}

two great causes, which\break
conspire with each other to\break
\lqq shorten life, says lord \textit{Verulam}, are\break
\lqq first\tsh

\indent\lqq The internal spirit, which like a gen-
\lqq \tight{tle flame wastes the body down to death:}\break
\lqq \tsk And secondly, the external air, that\break
\lqq parches the body up to ashes:\tsk which\break
\lqq two enemies attacking us on both sides\break
\lqq of our bodies together, at length de-\break
\lqq stroy our organs, and render them\break
\lqq unfit to carry on the functions of life.”

This being the state of the case; the road to Longevity was
plain; nothing more being required, says his lordship,\catch{but}
but to
repair the waste committed by the internal spirit, by making the
substance of it more thick and dense, by a regular course of
opiates on one side, and by refrigerating the heat of it on the
other, by three grains and a half of salt-petre every morning
before you got up.\tsh

Still this frame of ours was left exposed to the inimical
assaults of the air without;\tsk but this was fenced off again by
a course of greasy unctions, which\break so fully saturated the pores of
the skin, that no spicula could enter;\tsh nor\break
could any one get out.\tsh This put a\break
\stck{stop to all perspiration, sensible and insen-}
sible, which being the cause of so many scurvy
distempers\tsk a course of glisters was requisite to carry off
redundant humours,\tsk and render the system compleat.\patch{What}

What my father had to say to my lord of \textit{Verulam}’s
opiates, his salt-petre, and greasy unctions and glisters, you
shall read,\tsk but not to day\tsk or to morrow: time presses
upon me,\tsk my reader is impatient\tsk I must get
forwards.\tsh\break
You shall read the chapter at your lei\-sure,
(if you chuse it), as soon as ever\break the \textit{Tristrapædia}
is published.\tsh

Sufficeth it at present, to say, my father levelled the
hypothesis with the\break ground, and in doing that, the learned know, he
built up and established his own.\tsh

\dropcap{T}{he} whole secret of health, said\break
my father, beginning the sentence\break again, depending evidently upon the
due contention betwixt the radical heat and radical moisture within
us;\tsk the least imaginable skill had been sufficient to have
maintained it, had not the school-men confounded the task, merely
(as\break \textit{Van Helmont}, the famous chymist, has proved) by all
along mistaking the radical moisture for the tallow and fat of
animal bodies.

Now the radical moisture is not the tallow or fat of animals,
but an oily and balsamous substance; for the fat and\break tallow, as
also the phlegm or watery\catch{parts,} parts, are cold; whereas the oily and
balsamous parts are of a lively heat and spirit, which accounts for
the observation of \textit{Aristotle}, \lqq\textit{Quod omne
animal post\break\lqq coitum est} triste.”

Now it is certain, that the radical heat lives in the radical moisture, but whether
\textit{vice versâ}, is a doubt: however, when the one decays, the other decays
also; and then is produced, either an unnatural heat, which causes an unnatural
dryness\tsh or an unnatural moisture, which causes dropsies.\tsh So that if a child,
as he grows up, can but be taught to avoid running into fire or water, as either of
’em threaten his destruction,\tsh ’twill\break
be all that is needful to be done upon\break
that head.\tsh

\dropcap{T}{he} description of the siege of

powerfully than the last chapter;\tsk his

mentioned radical heat and radical moisture, but my uncle
\textit{Toby}\break
took his pipe out of his mouth, and\break

The poor fellow and I, quoth my uncle \textit{Toby}, addressing
himself to my father, \tight{were scarce able to
crawl out of our}
tents, at the time the siege of \textit{Limerick} was raised,
upon the very account you mention.\tsh Now what can
have got\break
into that precious noddle of thine, my dear brother
\textit{Toby?} cried my father,\break 
mentally.\tsh By Heaven! continued\break
he, communing still with himself, it\break
would puzzle an \textit{Œdipus} to bring it in\break
point.\tsh

I believe, an’ please your honour,\break
quoth the corporal, that if
it had not been for the quantity of brandy we set fire to every
night, and the claret and cinnamon with which I plyed your
honour off;\tsk And the geneva, \textit{Trim}, added my uncle
\textit{Toby}, which did us more good\break than all\tsh I verily
believe, continued\catch{the} 
the corporal, we had both, an’ please\break
\stck{your honour, left our lives in the trenches,}\break

\textit{Toby}, his eyes sparkling as he spoke, that\break
a soldier could wish to lie down in.\tsh\break
But a pitiful death for him!\@ an’ please\break

All this was as much \textit{Arabick} to my father, as the rites
of the \textit{Colchi} and \textit{Tro\-glodites}
\tight{had been before to my
uncle \textit{Toby};}\break
my father could not determine whether he was to
frown or to smile.\tsh

My uncle \textit{Toby}, turning to \textit{Yorick},\break

it,\tsk and so settled the point for my father at once.

\dropcap{I}{t} was undoubtedly, said my uncle\break
\textit{Toby}, a great happiness for myself\break
and the corporal, that we
had all along a burning fever, attended with a most raging thirst,
during the whole five and twenty days the flux was upon us in the
camp; otherwise what my brother calls the radical moisture,
must, as I con-\break 
ceive it, inevitably have got the better.\break
\tsh My father drew in his lungs top-\break
full of air, and looking up, blew it\break
forth again, as slowly as he possibly\break could.\tsh

\tsh  It was heaven’s mercy to us, continued my
uncle \textit{Toby}, which put it into the corporal’s head to
maintain that\catch{due} due contention betwixt the radical heat and the
radical moisture, by reinforce-\break ing the fever, as he did all along,
with hot wine and spices; whereby the corporal kept up (as it were)
a continual firing, so that the radical heat stood its ground from
the beginning to the end, and was a fair match for the moisture,
terrible as it was.\tsh Upon my honour, added my uncle
\textit{Toby}, you might have heard the contention within our bodies,
brother \textit{Shandy}, twenty toises.\tsk If there was no firing,
said \textit{Yorick}.

Well\tsk said my father, with a full aspiration, and pausing a while after

\tsh \textit{Yorick}, foreseeing the sentence was likely to end
with no sort of mercy, laid his hand upon my father’s breast,
and begged he would respite it for a few minutes, till he asked
the corporal a question.\tsh Prithee, \textit{Trim}, said
\textit{Yorick}, without staying for my father’s

\rightline{I think}

I think this is a new fashion, quoth Dr.\@ \textit{Slop}, of

\textit{Trim}.\tsk Then\break 
I wish the faculty would follow the cut\break
of it, said \textit{Yorick}.\tsk ’Tis all cut through,\break
an’ please your reverence, said the cor-\break
poral, with drains and bogs; and be-\break
sides, there was such a quantity of rain\break 
\stick{fell during the siege, the whole
country} was like a puddle,\tsh ’twas that, and
nothing else, which brought on the\break
flux, and which had like to have
killed both his honour and myself; now there was no such thing,
after the first ten\break days, continued the corporal, for a soldier to
lie dry in his tent, without cut-\break ting a ditch round it, to draw off
the\break water;\tsk nor was that enough, for those who could afford
it, as his honour\break could, without setting fire every night\catch{to} to a
pewter dish full of brandy, which took off the damp of the air, and
made\break the inside of the tent as warm as a\break stove.\tsh

And what conclusion dost thou draw, Corporal \textit{Trim}, cried
my father, from all these premises?

I infer, an’ please your worship, re\-plied \textit{Trim},
that the radical moisture is nothing in the world but
ditch-water\tsh\break and that the radical heat, of those who can go to
the expence of it, is burnt\break brandy\tsk the radical heat and

but ditch-water\tsk and a dram of geneva\tsh and give us

\textit{Slop} had not forgot \textit{Trim}’s comment\break
upon the sermon.\tsk

It is but an hour ago, replied \textit{Yorick}, since the corporal
was examined in the latter, and pass’d muster with great\break
honour.\tsh

The radical heat and moisture, quoth Doctor \textit{Slop}, turning
to my father, you must know, is the basis and foundation of our
being,\tsk as the root of a tree is the source and principle of
its vegeta-\catch{tion.\tsk}
tion.\tsk It is inherent in the seeds of all animals, and may be

\textit{Baldus} him-\break self, as eminent

entered
upon the law so late in life, that every body imagined he intended to be an advocate in

wonder, when \textit{Eudamidas}, the son of\break

asked gravely,\tsk \textit{If the old man be yet disputing and enquiring concerning

\textit{\tsk what time will he have to make

\textit{Yorick} listened to my father with great attention; there
was a seasoning of wisdom unaccountably mixed up with his strangest
whims, and he had sometimes such illuminations in the darkest of
his eclipses, as almost atoned for them:\tsk\break be wary, Sir, when
you imitate him.

I am convinced, \textit{Yorick}, continued\break
my father, half reading and half dis-\break
coursing, that there is a North west passage to the
intellectual world; and that the soul of man has shorter ways of
go-\break ing to work, in furnishing itself with\break knowledge and instruction,
than we generally take with it.\tsh But, alack! all fields
have not a river or a spring running\catch{be-} besides them;\tsk every
child, \textit{Yorick!} has not a parent to point it out.


\tsh The whole entirely depends, add\-ed my father, in a
low voice, upon the \textit{auxiliary verbs}, Mr.\@ \textit{Yorick}.

Had \textit{Yorick} trod upon \textit{Virgil} ’s snake,
he could not have looked more surprised.\break
\tsk I am surprised too,
cried my father,\break
observing it,\tsk and I reckon it as one of the
greatest calamities which ever befell the republick of letters, That
those who have been entrusted with the education of our children,
and whose business it was to open their minds, and stock them early
with ideas, in order to set the ima\-gination loose upon them, have
made so little use of the auxiliary verbs in doing it, as they have
done\tsh So that, ex-\catch{cept} cept \textit{Raymond Lullius}, and the
elder \textit{Pe\-legrini}, the last of which arrived to such
perfection in the use of ’em, with his to\-pics, that, in a few
lessons, he could teach a young gentleman to discourse with
plausibility upon any subject, \textit{pro} and \textit{con}, and to
say and write all that could be spoken or written concerning it,
without blotting a word, to the admiration of all who beheld
him.\tsk I should be glad, said \textit{Yorick}, interrupting my father,
to be made to comprehend this matter. You shall, said my
father.

The highest stretch of improvement a single word is capable of,
is a high metaphor,\tsh for which, in my opinion, the idea
is generally the worse, and not the better;\tsh but be
that as it may,\catch{\tsk when} 
\tsk when the mind has done that with it\break
\tsk there is an end,\tsk the mind and the\break
idea are at rest,\tsk until a second idea enters;\tsk and so on.

Now the use of the \textit{Auxiliaries} is, at once to set the
soul a going by herself upon the materials as they are brought her;
and by the versability of this great engine, round which they are
twisted,\break to open new tracts of enquiry, and make every idea
engender millions.

You excite my curiosity greatly, said \textit{Yorick}.

For my own part, quoth my uncle\break
\textit{Toby}, I have given it up.\tsh The \textit{Danes},\break
an’ please your honour, quoth the cor-\catch{poral,}
poral, who were on the left at the siege of \textit{Limerick}, were all
auxiliaries.\tsh And very good ones, said my uncle
\textit{Toby}.\tsk But the auxiliaries, \textit{Trim}, my brother is
talking about,\tsk I conceive to be different
things.\tsh

\tsh  Yo\sic\ do? said my father,
rising\break up.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace  XLIII.}

\dropcap{M}{y} father took a single turn across
the room, then sat down and finished the chapter.

The verbs auxiliary we are concerned in here, continued my
father, are, \textit{am};
\stck{\textit{was}; \textit{have}; \textit{had}; \textit{do}; \textit{did}; \textit{make}; \textit{made}; \textit{suf-}}\catch{\textit{fer};}
\stck{\textit{fer}; \textit{shall}; \textit{should};
\textit{will}; \textit{would};
\textit{can}; \textit{could};}
\textit{owe}; \textit{ought}; \textit{used}; or
\textit{is wont}.\tsk And these 
\stck{varied with tenses,
\textit{present}, \textit{past},
\textit{future}, and}
conjugated with the verb
\textit{see},\tsk or with these questions added to
them;\tsk \textit{Is it? Was it? Will it
be? Would it be? May\break 
it be? Might it be?} And these again\break
put negatively, \textit{Is it not? Was it not?}\break
\textit{Ought it not?}\tsk Or affirmatively,\tsk \textit{It is};\break
\textit{It was}; \textit{It ought to be}. Or chronologi-\break
cally,\tsk \textit{Has it been always? Lately?\break
How long ago?}\tsk Or hypothetically,\tsk \textit{If\break
it was}; \textit{If it was not?} What would\break
follow?\tsh If the \textit{French} should beat\break
the \textit{English?} If the \textit{Sun} go out of the\break
\textit{Zodiac?}

Now, by the right use and application of these, continued my
father, in which\catch{a} a child’s memory should be exercised, there
is no one idea can enter his brain how barren soever, but a
magazine of conceptions and conclusions may be\break drawn forth from
it.\tsh Did’st thou e-\break 
ver see a white bear? cried my father,\break
turning his head round to \textit{Trim}, who\break 
stood at the back of his chair:\tsk No,\break
an’ please your honour, replied the cor-\break
poral.\tsh But thou couldst discourse\break
about one, \textit{Trim}, said my father, in\break
case of need?\tsh How is it possible,\break
brother, quoth my uncle \textit{Toby}, if the\break
corporal never saw one?\tsh ’Tis the\break
fact I want; replied my father,\tsk and\break
the possibility of it, is as follows.

A \textsc{white bear}! Very well.  Have\break
I ever seen one? Might I ever have seen\catch{one?}
one? Am I ever to see one? Ought\break I ever
to have seen one? Or can I ever see one?

Would I had seen a white bear? (for how can I imagine it?)

If I should see a white bear, what\break
should I say? If I should
never see a white bear, what then?

If I never have, can, must, or shall see a white bear alive;
have I ever seen the skin of one? Did I ever see one
painted?\tsk described? Have I never dreamed of one?

Did my father, mother, uncle, aunt, brothers or sisters, ever
see a white bear?\catch{What} What would they give? How would\break
they behave? How would the white\break
bear have behaved? Is he wild?\break
Tame? Terrible? Rough? Smooth?

\tsk Is the white bear worth seeing?\tsk

\tsk Is there no sin in it?\tsk

Is it better than a \textsc{black one}?
