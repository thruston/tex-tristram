their devotions, and shut up the
duties of the day in prayer:\tsk no soul in all \textit{Strasburg}

Whilst all this confusion and disorder triumphed throughout the

description of the stranger’s nose\tsk they all agreed
together in two points\tsk namely, that he was gone to
\textit{Frankfort}, and would not return to
\textit{Strasburg} till that day month; and secondly,
whether his nose was true or false, that the stran\-ger

apparatus the straitness of the time would allow her, for
the illustration of her theory\tsk she staid no longer than
three days.

The centinel and the bandy-legg’d\break
drummer!\tsk nothing on this side of old \textit{Athens}
could equal them! they read\break 
their lectures under the city gates to\break
comers and goers, with all the pomp\catch{of} of a \textit{Chrysippus} and a
\textit{Crantor} in their porticos.

The master of the inn, with his ostler on his left-hand, read
his also in the same stile,\tsk under the portico or gateway of
his stable-yard\tsk his wife, hers more privately in a back room:
all flocked to their lectures; not promiscuously\tsk but to this
or that, as is ever the way, as faith and credulity marshal’d
them\tsk in a word, each \textit{Strasburger} came crouding
for intelligence\tsk and every \textit{Strasburger} had the
intelligence he wanted.

Tis worth remarking, for the benefit of all demonstrators
in natural philosophy, \etc that as soon as the
trumpeter’s wife had finished the abbess of
\textit{Quedlin-berg}’s private lecture, and had begun to read
in public, which she did upon a\catch{stool} stool in the middle of the great
parade,\tsh she incommoded the other demonstrators
mainly, by gaining incontinently the most fashionable part of the
city of \textit{Strasburg} for her auditory\tsk But when a
de-\break monstrator in philosophy (cries \textit{Slawken\-bergius}) has a
\textit{trumpet} for an apparatus, pray what rival in science can
pretend to be heard besides him?

Whilst the unlearned, thro’ these conduits of
intelligence, were all busied in getting down to the bottom of the
well, where \textsc{truth} keeps her little
court\tsh were the learned in their way as busy in pumping
her up thro’ the conduits of dialect
induction\tsk they concerned themselves not with
facts\tsk they reasoned\tsk

Not one profession had thrown more light upon this subject than
the faculty\tsk\catch{had} had not all their disputes about it run into the
affair of \textit{Wens} and œdematous swellings, they could not
keep clear of them for their bloods and souls\tsh the
stranger’s nose had nothing to do either with wens or
œdematous swellings.

It was demonstrated however very sa\-tisfactorily, that such a ponderous mass of
heterogenous matter could not be congested and conglomerated to the
nose, whilst the infant was \textit{in Utero}, without destroying the
statical balance of the\break
fœtus, and throwing it plump upon its
head nine months before the time.\tsh

\tsk The opponents granted the theory\tsk\break they
denied the co\rotatebox[origin=c]{180}{n}\sic sequences.

And if a suitable provision of veins, arteries, \etc said
they, was not laid in,\catch{for} for the due nourishment of such a nose, in
the very first stamina and rudiments of its formation  before it
came into the world (bating the case of Wens) it could not
regularly grow and be sustained afterwards.

\tight{This was all answered by a dissertation}\break upon nutriment, and the
effect which nutriment had in extending the vessels, and in the
increase and prolongation of the muscular parts to the greatest
growth and expansion imaginable\tsk In the triumph of which
theory, they went so far as to affirm, that there was no cause
in nature, why a nose might not grow to the size of the
man himself.

The respondents satisfied the world this event could never
happen to them so long as a man had but one stomach and\catch{one}
\stick{one pair of lungs\tsk For the stomach, said}
they, being the
only organ destined for the reception of food, and turning
it into chyle,\tsk and the lungs the only engine of
\stck{sanguification\tsk it could possibly work off}
no more, than
what the appetite brought it: or admitting the possibility
of a man’s overloading his stomach, nature had set bounds
however to his lungs\tsk the engine was of a determined size
and strength, and could elaborate but a certain quantity in
a given time\tsk that is, it could produce just as much
blood as was sufficient for one single man, and no more; so
that, if there was as much nose as man\tsk they proved a
mortification must necessarily ensue; and forasmuch as there
could not be a support for both, that the nose must either
fall off from the man, or the man inevitably fall off from
his nose.\patch{Nature}

Nature accommodates herself to these emergencies, cried the
opponents\tsk else what do you say to the case of a whole
stomach\tsk a whole pair of lungs, and but \textit{half} a man, when both
his legs have been unfortunately shot off?\tsk

He dies of a plethora, said they\tsk or must spit blood, and
in a fortnight or three weeks go off in a
consumption\tsk

\tsh It happens otherways\tsk replied the
opponents.\tsh

It ought not, said they.

The more curious and intimate inquirers after nature and her
doings, though they went hand in hand a good way together,
yet they all divided about the nose at last, almost as much
as the faculty itself.\patch{They}

They amicably laid it down, that there was a just and
geometrical arrangement and proportion of the several parts of the
human frame to its several destinations, offices, and functions,
which could not be transgressed but within certain
limits\break
\stick{\tsk that nature, though she sported\tsk she}
\stick{sported within a certain circle;\tsk and they}
could not agree about the diameter of it.

The logicians stuck much closer to the point before them than
any of the classes of the literati;\tsh they began and
ended with the word nose; and had it not been for a \textit{petitio
principii}, which one of the ablest of them ran his head against
in the beginning of the combat, the whole controversy had been
settled at once.

A nose, argued the logician, cannot bleed without
blood\tsk and not only blood\catch{\tsk but}
\tsk but blood circulating in it to
supply the phænomenon with a succession of drops\tsk (a
stream being but a quicker succession of drops, that is included,
said he)\tsk Now death, continued the logician, being
nothing but the stagnation of the blood\tsh

I deny the definition\tsh Death is the separation of
the soul from the body, said his antagonist\tsk Then we
don’t agree about our weapons, said the
logician\tsk Then there is an end of the dispute, re\-plied the
antagonist.

The civilians were still more concise: what they offered being
more in the nature of a decree\tsk than a dispute.

\tsk Such a monstrous nose, said they, 
\stck{had it been a true nose, could not possibly}
\stick{have been suffered in civil society\tsk and if}\catch{false}
false\tsk to impose upon society with such false signs and
tokens, was a still greater violation of its rights, and must have
had still less mercy shewn it.

The only objection to this was, that\break
if it proved any thing, it proved the\break
\stck{stranger’s nose was neither true nor false.}

This left room for the controversy to go on. It was maintained by the advocates
of the ecclesiastic court, that there was nothing to inhibit a decree, since
the stranger \textit{ex mero motu} had confessed he had been at the Promontory of
Noses, and had got one of the goodliest, \etc\etc\break
\tsk To this
it was answered, it was impossible there should be such a place as the
Promontory of Noses, and the learned be ignorant where it lay. The commissary
of the bishop of \textit{Strasburg} undertook the\catch{advocates,}
advocates, explained this matter in a\break
\stck{treatise upon proverbial phrases, shewing}
them, that the Promontory of Noses was
a mere allegoric expression, importing no more than that nature

of \textit{Martin Luther}’s damnation.

The little objection of the \textit{Lutheran}\break

will be bold to say, he might have read all the books in the
\textit{Alexandrian} Library, had not fate taken\catch{other} other care of them,
and not have met with a book or passage in one, which hit two such
nails as these upon the head at one stroke.]

The two universities of \textit{Strasburg} were hard tugging at
this affair of \textit{Luther}’s navigation. The Protestant
doctors had\break 
\stck{demonstrated, that he had not sailed right}
before the
wind, as the Popish doctors had pretended; and as every one knew
there was no sailing full in the teeth of it,\tsk they were going
to settle, in case he had sailed, how many points he was off;
whether \textit{Martin} had doubled the cape, or had fallen upon a
lee-shore; and no doubt, as it was an enquiry of much edi\-fication,
at least to those who understood\break
\stck{this sort of \textsc{navigation}, they had gone on} 
with it in spite of the
size of the stranger’s nose, had not the size of the
stranger’s\catch{nose} nose drawn off the attention of the world from
what they were about\tsk it was their business to
follow.\tsh

\vskip -2pt

The abbess of \textit{Quedlinberg} and her four 
\stick{dignitaries was no stop; for the enormity} 
\stick{\tight{of the stranger’s nose running full as much}}
in their fancies as their case of conscience\break
\tsk The affair of their placket-holes kept
cold\tsk In a word, the printers were ordered to distribute their
types\tsk all controversies dropp’d.

’Twas a square cap with a silver tassel upon the crown of
it\tsk to a nut shell\tsk\break to have guessed on which side of the
nose the two universities would split.

’Tis above reason, cried the doctors on one side.

\vskip -2pt

’Tis below reason, cried the others.

\vskip -2pt

’Tis faith, cried one.\patch{’Tis}

’Tis a fiddle-stick, said the other.

’Tis possible, cried the one.

’Tis impossible, said the other.

God’s power is infinite, cried the No\-sarians, he can do
any thing.

He can do nothing, replied the Anti-nosarians, which implies
contradictions.

He can make matter think, said the Nosarians.


\tighter{As certainly as you can make a velvet cap}\break
\stick{\tighter{out of a sow’s ear, replied the Antinosarians.}}

He cannot make two and two five, replied the Popish
doctors.\tsh ’Tis false, said their opponents.\tsk

Infinite power is infinite power, said the doctors who
maintained the \textit{reality}\catch{of}
of the nose.\tsh It extends only to
all possible things, replied the \textit{Lutherans}.

By God in heaven, cried the Popish doctors, he can make a nose,
if he thinks fit, as big as the steeple of \textit{Strasburg}.

Now the steeple of \textit{Strasburg} being the biggest and the
tallest church-steeple to be seen in the whole world, the
Antino\-sarians denied that a nose of 575 geome\-trical feet in length
could be worn, at least by a middle-siz’d
man\tsk The Popish doctors swore it could\tsk The
\textit{Lutheran} doctors said No;\tsk it could not.

This at once started a new dispute, which they pursued a great
way upon the extent and limitation of the moral and natural
attributes of God\tsk That controversy led them naturally into
\textit{Thomas}\catch{\textit{Aquinas},} \textit{Aquinas}, and \textit{Thomas
Aquinas} to the\break devil.

\tight{The stranger’s nose was no more heard}
\stck{of in the dispute\tsk it just served as a frigate}
to launch them into the gulph of school-divinity,\tsk and then they all
sailed before the wind.

Heat is in proportion to the want of true knowledge.

The controversy about the attributes, \etc instead of
cooling, on the contrary had inflamed the \textit{Strasburgers}
imaginations to a most inordinate degree\tsk The less they
understood of the matter, the greater was their wonder about
it\tsk they were left in all the distresses of desire
unsatisfied\tsk saw their doctors, the
\textit{Parchmentarians}, the \textit{Brassarians}, the
\textit{Turpentarians}, on one side\tsk the Popish
doctors\catch{on}
on the other, like \textit{Pantagruel} and his companions in
quest of the oracle of the bottle, all embarked and out of
sight.

\tsh The poor \textit{Strasburgers} left upon the
beach!

\stick{\hfill\tsk What was to be done?\tsk No delay}\break

Unfortunate \textit{Strasburgers!} was there in the

On the twenty-eighth the courteous stranger had promised to
return to \textit{Strasburg.}

Seven thousand coaches (\textit{Slawkenber\-gius} must certainly have made some
mistake in his numeral characters) 7000\break

\noindent
\stick{\hfill Haste we now towards the catastrophe}
of my tale\tsk I say \textit{Catastrophe} (cries
\textit{Slaw-\break kenbergius}) inasmuch as a
tale, with parts rightly disposed, not only rejoiceth
(\textit{gau\-det}) in the \textit{Catastrophe} and
\textit{Peripeitia} of\break
a \textsc{Drama}, but rejoiceth moreover in all the essential
and integrant parts of it\tsh\break
it has its \textit{Protasis}, \textit{Epitasis}, \textit{Catastasis},\break
\lower.2ex\hbox{i}\sic ts \textit{Catastrophe} or
\textit{Peripeitia} growing one out of the other in it, in the order
\textit{Aristotle} first planted them\tsh without which a
tale\catch{had} had better never be told at all, says\break
\textit{Slawkenbergius}, but be kept to a man’s\break
self.

In all my ten tales, in all my ten de\-cads, have I,
\textit{Slawkenbergius}, tied down every tale of them as
tightly to this rule, as I have done this of the stranger and\break
his nose.

\tsk From his first parley with the centi\-nel, to his
leaving the city of \textit{Strasburg}, after pulling off his
crimson-sattin pair of breeches, is the \textit{Protasis} or first
entrance\break
\tsk where the characters of the \textit{Personæ
Dramatis} are just touched in, and the subject slightly
begun.

The \textit{Epitasis}, wherein the action is\break
more fully entered upon and heightened,\break
till it arrives at its state or height called\catch{the}
the \textit{Catastasis}, and which usually takes up the 2d and 3d
act, is included within that busy period of my tale, betwixt the
first night’s uproar about the nose, to the conclusion of the
trumpeter’s wife’s lectures upon it in the middle of
the grand parade: and from the first embarking of the learned in
the dispute\tsk to the doctors finally sailing away, and leaving
the \textit{Strasburgers} upon the beach in distress, is the
\textit{Catastasis} or the ripening of the incidents and passions for their bursting
forth in the fifth act.

This commences with the setting out of the \textit{Strasburgers}
in the \textit{Frankfort} road, and terminates in unwinding the
laby\-rinth and bringing the hero out of a state of agitation (as
\textit{Aristotle} calls it) to a state of rest and quietness.\patch{This,}

This, says \textit{Hafen Slawkenbergius}, constitutes the
catastrophe or peripeitia of my tale\tsk and that
is the part of it I am going to relate.

We left the stranger behind the curtain asleep\tsk he
enters now upon the stage.

\tsk What dost thou prick up thy ears \tight{at?\tsk ’tis nothing
but a man upon a horse}\break
\tsk was the last word the stranger uttered
to his mule. It was not proper then to\break
tell the reader, that the mule took his\break
master’s word for it; and without any\break
more \textit{ifs} or \textit{ands}, let the
traveller and his horse pass by.

The traveller was hastening with all diligence to get to
\textit{Strasburg} that night\break\tsk What a fool am I, said the
traveller to himself, when he had rode about a\catch{league} league farther,
to think of getting into \textit{Strasburg} this
night.\tsk \textit{Strasburg!}\tsk the great
\textit{Strasburg!}\tsk \textit{Strasburg}, the capital of all
\textit{Alsatia!} \textit{Strasburg}, an imperial city!
\textit{Strasburg}, a sovereign state! \textit{Strasburg}, garrisoned
with five thousand of the best troops in all the world!\tsk
Alas!\break
if I was at the gates of \textit{Strasburg} this moment, I could not
gain admittance into it for a ducat,\tsk nay a ducat and
half\tsk ’tis too much\tsk better go back to the last inn
I have passed\tsk than lie I know not
where\tsk or give I know not what. The traveller, as he
made these reflections in his mind, turned his horse’s head
about, and three minutes after the stranger had been conducted into
his chamber, he arrived at the same inn.

\tsk We have bacon in the house, said the host, and
bread\tsh and till eleven o’clock this night had
three eggs in it\tsk\catch{but}
but a stranger, who arrived an hour
ago, has had them dressed into an omelet, and we have
nothing.\tsh

\tsk Alas! said the traveller, harassed as I am, I want nothing but a
bed.\tsh I have one as soft as is in \textit{Alsatia}, said
the\break host.

\tsk The stranger, continued he, should have slept in
it, for ’tis my best bed, but upon the score of his
nose\tsk He has got a defluxion, said the
traveller\tsk Not that 
I know, cried the host\tsk But ’tis a camp-\break 
bed, and \textit{Jacinta}, said he, looking to-\break 
wards the maid, imagined there was not room in
it to turn his nose in\tsk Why so? cried the traveller,
starting back.\tsk It is so long a nose, replied the
host.\tsk The traveller fixed his eyes upon
\textit{Jacinta}, then upon the ground\tsk kneeled upon his
right\catch{knee}
knee\tsk had just got his hand laid upon\break his
breast\tsk Trifle not with my anxiety,
\stick{said he, rising up again.\tsk ’Tis no trifle,}
\stick{said \textit{Jacinta}, ’tis the most glorious

\tsk The traveller fell
upon his knee again\tsk\break
\tight{laid his hand upon his breast\tsk then, said he,} 
looking up to heaven! thou hast conducted me to the end of
my pilgrimage\break\tsh ’Tis \textit{Diego!}

The traveller was the brother of the Julia, so often
invoked that night by the stranger as he rode from \textit{Strasburg}
upon his mule; and was come, on her part,\break 
in quest of him. He had accompanied\break
his sister from \textit{Valadolid} across the
\textit{Pyrenean} mountains thro’ \textit{France}, and had\break
many an entangled skein to wind off in pursuit of him thro’ the many
meanders and abrupt turnings of a lover’s thorny tracks.\patch{\tsk Julia}

\tsk Julia had sunk under it\tsk and had
not been able to go a step farther than to \textit{Lyons}, where,
with the many disquietudes of a tender heart, which all talk
of\tsk but few feel\tsk she sicken’d, but had just
strength to write a letter to \textit{Diego}; and having conjured her
brother never to see her face till he had found him out, and put
the letter into his hands, Julia took to her bed.

\textit{Fernandez} (for that was her brother’s
name)\tsh tho’ the camp-bed was as soft as any one
in \textit{Alsace}, yet he could not shut his eyes in
it.\tsk As soon as it was day he rose, and hearing
\textit{Diego} was risen too,\break
he enter’d his chamber, and discharged his
sister’s commission.

The letter was as follows:\patch{Seig.}

She could proceed no farther.

\textit{Slawkenbergius} supposes the word intended was
\textit{unconvinced}, but her strength would not enable her to finish her
letter.

The heart of the courteous \textit{Diego}\break
overflowed as he read the letter\tsk he or-\break
dered his mule forthwith and
\textit{Fernandez}’s\catch{horse} horse
to be saddled; and as no vent in

The lines were very natural\tsk for they were nothing
at all to the purpose, says \textit{Slawkenbergius}, and ’tis a
pity there were no more of them; but whether it was that
Seig.\@ \textit{Diego} was slow in composing \stick{verses\tsk or the ostler
quick in saddling} mules\tsk is not averred; certain it
was, that \textit{Diego}’s mule and \textit{Fernandez}’s
horse were ready at the door of the inn, before \textit{Diego} was
ready for his second stanza; so without staying to finish his ode,
they both mounted, sallied forth, passed the \textit{Rhine}, traversed
\textit{Alsace}, shaped their\break 
course towards \textit{Lyons}, and before the\break
\stick{\tight{\textit{Strasburgers} and the abbess of
\textit{Quedlinberg}}} had
set out on their cavalcade, had \textit{Fernandez, Diego}, and his
\textit{Julia}, crossed the \textit{Pyrenean} mountains, and got safe
to\break
\textit{Valadolid.}

\rightline{’Tis}
\newpage
’Tis needless to inform the geographical reader, that when
\textit{Diego} was in \textit{Spain}, it was not possible to meet the
courteous stranger in the \textit{Frankfort} road; it is enough to
say, that of all restless desires, curiosity being the
strongest\tsk the \textit{Strasburgers} felt the full force
of it; and that for three days and nights they were tossed to and
fro in the \textit{Frankfort} road, with the tempestuous fury of this
passion, before they could submit to return home.\tsk When
alas! an event was prepared for them, of all others the most
grievous that could befal a free people.

As this revolution of the \textit{Strasburgers} affairs is often
spoken of, and little understood, I will, in ten words, says
\textit{Slawkenbergius}, give the world an explanation of it, and with it put an end to my tale.

\rightline{Every}
\newpage
Every body knows of the grand system of Universal Monarchy,
wrote by\break
order of Mons.\@ \textit{Colbert}, and put in ma\-nuscript into
the hands of \textit{Lewis} the fourteenth, in the year 1664.

’Tis as well known, that one branch out of many of that
system, was the\break
getting possession of \textit{Strasburg}, to favour
an entrance at all times into \textit{Suabia}, in\break
order to disturb the quiet of \textit{Germany}\tsh\break
and that in consequence of this plan,\break
\textit{Strasburg} unhappily fell at length into their
hands.

It is the lot of a few to trace out the true springs of this and
such like revolutions\tsk The vulgar look too high for
them\tsk Statesmen look too low\tsk Truth (for once)
lies in the middle.

\rightline{What}
\newpage
What a fatal thing is the popular pride of a free city!\@ cries
one historian\tsk The \textit{Strasburgers} deemed it a diminution
of their freedom to receive an imperial garrison\tsk so
fell a prey to a \textit{French} one.

The fate, says another, of the \textit{Strasburgers}, may be a
warning to all free people to save their money.\tsk They
anticipated their revenues\tsk brought themselves under
taxes, exhausted their\break strength, and in the end became so weak a
people, they had not strength to keep their gates shut, and so the
\textit{French} pushed them open.

Alas!\@ alas!\@ cries \textit{Slawkenbergius}, ’twas not the
\textit{French},\tsk ’twas \textsc{curiosity}
pushed them open\tsk The \textit{French} indeed, who are
ever upon the catch, when they saw the \textit{Strasburgers}, men,
women, and children,\catch{all} all marched out to follow the stranger’s
nose\tsh each man followed his own, and marched in.

Trade and manufactures have decayed and gradually grown down
ever since\tsk but not from any cause which commercial heads have
assigned; for it is owing to this only, that Noses have ever so run
in their heads, that the \textit{Strasburgers} could not follow their
business.

Alas! alas! cries \textit{Slawkenbergius}, ma\-king an
exclamation\tsk it is not the first\tsh and I fear will not be the last
fortress
\stick{that has been either won\tsh or lost by}\break

To tell that before-hand, madam,\break would be to do injury to one of
the best tales in the christian world; and that is the tenth of the
tenth decad, which immediately follows this.

This tale, cried \textit{Slawkenbergius}, somewhat exultingly, has
been reserved by me for the concluding tale of my whole work;
knowing right well, that when I shall have told it, and my reader
shall have read it thro’\tsk ’twould be even high

\textit{Slawkenbergius}, as I know of no tale which could possibly

\dropcap{M}{y} father lay stretched across the
bed as still as if the hand of death had pushed him down, for a
full hour and a half, before he began to play upon the floor
with the toe of that foot which hung over the bed-side; my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s heart was a pound lighter for
it.\tsh In a few moments, his left-hand, the knuckles of
which had all the time reclined upon the handle of the chamber-pot,
came to its feeling\tsk he thrust it a little more\catch{within} within the
valance\tsk drew up his hand, when he had done, into his
bosom\tsk gave a hem!\tsk My good uncle \textit{Toby}, with infinite
pleasure, answered it; and full gladly would have ingrafted a
sentence of consolation upon the opening it afforded: but having no
talents, as I said, that way, and fearing moreover that he might
set out with something which might make a bad matter worse, he
contented himself with resting his chin placidly upon the cross of
his crutch.

Now whether the compression shortened my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s face into a more pleasurable oval\tsk or that
the philanthropy of his heart, in seeing his brother beginning to
emerge out of the sea of his afflictions, had braced up his
muscles\tsh so that the compression upon his chin only
doubled the benignity which was\catch{there} there before, is not hard to
decide.\tsk My father, in turning his eyes, was struck
with such a gleam of sun-shine in his face, as melted down the
sullenness of his grief in a moment.

He broke silence as follows.

\dropcap{D}{id} ever man, brother \textit{Toby}, cried\break
my father, raising himself up upon\break

the bed, where my uncle \textit{Toby} was sitting in his old
fringed chair, with his chin resting upon his\break
crutch\tsk did ever a poor unfortunate man, brother
\textit{Toby}, cried my father, receive so many lashes?\tsh
The most I ever saw given, quoth my uncle \textit{Toby}
(ringing\catch{the} the bell at the bed’s head for \textit{Trim})
was to a grenadier, I think in \textit{Makay}’s regiment.

\tsh Had my uncle \textit{Toby} shot a bullet thro’ my

upon the quilt more suddenly.

he spoke\tsk to think of two virtuous lads with hearts as
warm in their bodies, and as honest as God could make

\tsk My father could not help blushing.

that goodness of thy heart I have had such proofs of\tsk
whilst thy master is worth a shilling\tsk thou shalt never

attempted to thank my uncle \textit{Toby}\tsk but had not
power\tsk tears trickled down his cheeks faster than he

\dropcap{I}{s} this a fit time, said my father to\break

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace VI.}

\dropcap{W}{hen} my uncle \textit{Toby} first men-\break
tioned the grenadier, my father,\break
I said, fell down with his nose flat to the quilt, and as
suddenly as if my uncle\catch{\textit{Toby}}
\textit{Toby} had shot him; but it was not added that every
other limb and member of my father instantly relapsed with
his nose into the same precise attitude in which he lay
first described; so that when corporal \textit{Trim} left
the room, and my father found himself disposed to rise off
the bed,\tsk he had all the little preparatory movements to
run over again, before he could do it.\break\tsk  Attitudes are
nothing, madam,\tsk ’tis the transition from one attitude to
another\tsk like the preparation and resolution of the
discord into harmony, which is all in all.

For which reason my father played the same jig over again with
his toe upon the floor\tsh pushed the chamber-pot still a
little farther within the valance\tsk gave a hem\tsk raised
himself up upon his elbow\tsk and was just beginning to address
himself to my uncle \textit{Toby}\tsk when recol-\catch{lecting}

turn across the room, he stopped short before my uncle
\textit{Toby}; and laying the three first\break
fingers of his right-hand in the palm of his left, and stooping a little,
he addressed himself to my uncle \textit{Toby} as follows.

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace VII.}

\dropcap{W}{hen} I reflect, brother \textit{Toby},\break
upon \textsc{man}; and take a view of\break
that dark side of him which represents his life as open to
so many causes of trouble\tsk when I consider, brother
\textit{Toby}, how oft we eat the bread of affliction, and
that we are born to it, as to the portion of our
inheritance\tsk I was born to nothing, quoth my uncle
\textit{Toby}, inter-\catch{rupting}
rupting my father\tsk but my commission.
Zooks! said my father, did not my uncle leave you a hundred
and twenty pounds a year?\tsk What could I have done without
it? replied my uncle \textit{Toby} \tsk That’s another
concern, said my father testily\tsk\break But I say \textit{Toby},
when one runs over the catalogue of all the cross reckonings
and sorrowful \textit{items} with which the heart of man is
overcharged, ’tis wonderful by \tight{what hidden resources the
mind is enabled} to stand it out, and bear itself up, as it
does against the impositions laid upon our nature.\tsh ’Tis
by the assistance of Almighty God, cried my uncle
\textit{Toby}, looking up, and pressing the palms of his
hands close together\tsk ’tis not from our own strength,
brother \textit{Shandy}\tsk a sentinel in a wooden
centry-box, might as well pretend to stand it out against a
detachment of fifty men,\tsk we are upheld\catch{by} by the grace and
the assistance of the best of Beings.

\tsk That is cutting the knot, said my father, instead
of untying it,\tsk But give me leave to lead you, brother
\textit{Toby}, a little deeper into the mystery.

With all my heart, replied my uncle \textit{Toby}.

My father instantly exchanged the attitude he was in, for that
in which \textit{So\-crates} is so finely painted by \textit{Raffael} in
his school of \textit{Athens}; which your connoisseurship knows is so
exquisitely imagined, that even the particular manner of the
reasoning of \textit{Socrates} is expressed by it\tsk for he holds
the fore-finger of his left-hand between the fore-finger and the
thumb of his right, and seems as if he\catch{was}
was saying to the libertine he is re-\break
claiming\tsk \lqq\textit{You grant me} this\tsk and this:\break
\lqq and this, and this, I don’t ask of\break
\lqq you\tsk they follow of themselves in\break

So stood my father, holding fast his fore-finger betwixt his
finger and his\break thumb, and reasoning with my
uncle\break
\textit{Toby} as he sat in his old fringed chair, valanced
around with party-coloured\break worsted bobs\tsk O

My father followed \textit{Susannah} with his night-gown across

thrust only half into the button-hole.

\initial{I}{Wish} I could write a chapter upon\break
sleep.

A fitter occasion could never have presented itself, than what
this moment offers, when all the curtains of the family are
drawn\tsk the candles put out\tsk and no creature’s eyes
are open but a single one, for the other has been shut these twenty
years, of my mother’s nurse.

It is a fine subject!\patch{And}

And yet, as fine as it is, I would undertake to write a dozen chapters upon
button-holes, both quicker and with\break
more fame, than a single
chapter upon this.

Button-holes!\tsh there is something\break
lively in the very idea of ’em\tsk and trust\break
me, when I get amongst ’em\tsk You\break
gentry with great beards\tsh look as\break
grave as you will\tsh I’ll make merry\break
work with my button-holes\tsk I shall have
’em all to myself\tsk ’tis a maiden subject\break\tsk I shall run
foul of no man’s wisdom or fine sayings in it.

But for sleep\tsk I know I shall make nothing of it before I begin\tsk I am no dab at
your fine sayings in the first place\break\tsk and in the
next, I cannot for my soul\catch{set}
set a grave face upon a bad matter, and tell the world\tsk
’tis the refuge of the unfortunate\tsk the enfranchisement
of the prisoner\tsk the downy lap of the hopeless, the
weary and the broken-hearted; nor could I set out with a
lye in my mouth, by affirming, that of all the soft and
delicious functions of our nature, by which the great Author
of it, in his bounty, has been pleased to recompence the
sufferings wherewith his justice and his good pleasure has
wearied us,\tsh that this is the chiefest (I know pleasures
worth ten of it) or what a happiness it is to man, when the
anxieties and passions of the day are over, and he lies down
upon his back, that his soul shall be so seated within him,
that which ever way she turns her eyes, the heavens shall
look calm and sweet above her\tsk no desire\tsk or fear\tsk
or doubt that troubles the air,\catch{nor}
\stick{nor any difficulty pass’d,
present, or to} come, that the imagination may not\break
pass over without offence, in that sweet\break secession.

\tsk\lqq God’s blessing, said \textit{Sancho Panca},\break
\lqq be upon the man who first invented\break
\lqq this self-same thing called sleep\tsk it\break
\lqq covers a man all over like a cloak.”\break
Now there is more to me in this, and it speaks warmer to my
heart and affections, than all the dissertations squeez’d out
of the heads of the learned together upon the subject.

\tsk Not that I altogether disapprove of what \textit{Montaigne} advances upon

\dropcap{W}{hen} the misfortune of my\break

father’s head;\tsk the reader remembers that he walked
instantly up stairs, and cast himself down upon his bed; and
from hence, unless he has a great insight into human nature,
he will be apt to expect a rotation of the same ascending
and descending movements from him, upon this misfortune of
my \textsc{Name};\tsh\break no.

The different weight, dear Sir\tsh nay even the
different package of two vexations of the same
weight,\tsh makes a very wide difference in our manner of
bearing and getting through with them.\tsk It is\catch{not} not half
an hour ago, when (in the great hurry and precipitation of a poor
devil’s writing for daily bread) I threw a fair sheet, which
I had just finished, and carefully wrote out, slap into the fire,
instead of the foul one.

Instantly I snatch’d off my wig, and threw it
perpendicularly, with all imaginable violence, up to the top of the
room\break\tsk indeed I caught it as it fell\tsk but there was
an end of the matter; nor do I think any think else in
\textit{Nature} would have given such immediate ease: She, dear
Goddess, by an instantaneous impulse, in all \textit{provoking
cases}, determines us to a sally of this or that member\tsk or
else she thrusts us into this or that place, or posture of body, we
know not why\tsk But mark, madam, we live amongst riddles
and mysteries\tsk the most obvious\catch{things,} things, which come in
our way, have dark sides, which the quickest sight cannot penetrate
into; and even the clearest \stck{and most exalted understandings amongst}
us find ourselves puzzled and at a loss in almost every cranny of
nature’s works; so that this, like a thousand other things,
falls out for us in a way, which tho’ we cannot reason upon
it,\tsk yet we find the good of it, may it please your reverences
and your worships\tsh and that’s enough for us.

Now, my father could not lie down with this affliction for his
life\tsk nor could he carry it up stairs like the other\tsk
He walked composedly out with it to the fish-pond.

Had my father leaned his head upon his hand, and reasoned an
hour which\catch{way} way to have gone\tsk reason, with all her
force, could not have directed him to any think like it: there is
something, Sir, in fish-ponds\tsk but what it is, I leave\break
\tight{to system builders and fish pond diggers} betwixt ’em to find
out\tsk but there is something, under the first disorderly\break
transport of the humours, so unaccountably becalming in an orderly
and a sober walk towards one of them, that I have often wondered
that neither \textit{Pythagoras}, nor \textit{Plato}, nor \textit{Solon},

\dropcap{\Usk{16pt}N}{o} doubt, Sir\tsk there is
a whole\break
chapter wanting here\tsk and a\break 
chasm of ten pages made in the book
by it\tsk but the book-binder is neither a\break 
fool, or a knave, or a puppy\tsk nor is the\break
book a jot more imperfect, (at least upon\break 
that score)\tsk but, on the contrary, the\break
book is more perfect and complete by\break
wanting the chapter, than having it, as\break
I shall demonstrate to your reverences in this
manner\tsk I question first by the bye, whether the same
experiment might not be made as successfully upon sundry other
chapters\tsh but there is no end, an’ please your
reverences, in trying experiments upon chapters\tsh we
have had\catch{enough} enough of it\tsh So there’s an end of that
matter.

But before I begin my demonstration, let me only tell you,
that the chapter which I have torn out, and which otherwise
you would all have been reading\break just now, instead of
this,\tsk was the description of my father’s, my uncle
\textit{Toby}’s, \textit{Trim}’s, and \textit{Obadiah}’s
setting out and\break journeying to the visitation at
\raise3pt\hbox{\astiv}.

We’ll go in the coach, said my father\break
\tsk Prithee, have the arms been altered,
\textit{Obadiah}?\tsk It would have made my story much
better to have begun with telling you, that at the time my
mother’s arms were added to the \textit{Shandy}’s, when the
coach was repainted upon my father’s marriage, it had so
fallen out, that the coach painter, whether by performing\catch{all} all
his works with the left hand, like\break
\textit{Turpilius} the
\textit{Roman}, or \textit{Hans Holbein} of
\textit{Basil}\tsk or whether ’twas more from the blunder of
his head than hand\tsk or whe\-ther, lastly, it was from the
sinister turn which every thing relating to our family was
apt to take\tsk It so fell out, however, to our reproach,
that instead of the \textit{bend dexter}, which since
\textit{Harry} the Eighth’s reign was honestly our due\tsk a
\textit{bend sinister}, by some of these fatalities, had
been drawn quite across the field of the \textit{Shandy}-arms. 
’Tis scarce credible that the mind of so wise a man as
my father was, could be so much incommoded with so small a
matter. The word coach\tsk let it be whose it would\tsk or
coach-man, or coach-horse, or coach-hire, could never be
named in the family, but he constantly complained of
carrying this vile mark of illegitimacy upon the door of his
own;\catch{he} he never once was able to step into the coach, or out
of it, without turning\break round to take a view of the arms, and
making a vow at the same time, that it was the last time he
would ever set his foot in it again, till the
\textit{bend-sinister} was taken out\tsk but like the affair
of the hinge, it was one of the many things which the
\textit{Destinies} had set down in their books\tsk ever to be
grumbled at (and in wiser families than ours)\tsk but never
to\break be mended.

\tsk Has the \textit{bend-sinister} been brush’d out, I
say? said my father\tsk There has been nothing brush’d out, Sir, answered
\textit{Obadiah}, but the lining. We’ll go\break o’horse-back,
said my father, turning to \textit{Yorick}\tsk Of all things in the
world, except politicks, the clergy know the least of heraldry,
said \textit{Yorick.}\tsk No matter for\catch{that,} that, cried my
father\tsk I should be sorry to appear with a blot in my
escutcheon before them\tsh Never mind the
\textit{bend-sinister}, said my uncle \textit{Toby}, putting
on his tye-wig\tsh No, indeed, said my father,\break \tsk you
may go with my aunt \textit{Dinah} to a visitation with a
\textit{bend-sinister}, if you think fit\tsk My poor uncle
\textit{Toby} blush’d. My father was vexed at himself.\tsk
No\tsk my dear brother \textit{Toby}, said my father,
changing his tone\tsk but the damp of the coach-lining about
my loins, may give \stick{me the Sciatica again, as it did
\textit{December},} \textit{January}, and \textit{February} last
winter\tsk so if you please you shall ride my wife’s
pad\break\tsk
and as you are to preach, \textit{Yorick}, you had better
make the best of your way before,\tsk and leave me to take
care of my brother \textit{Toby}, and to follow at our\break
own rates.\patch{Now}

Now the chapter I was obliged to tear\break
out, was the descriptionof this cavalcade,\break
in which corporal \textit{Trim} and \textit{Obadiah},\break
upon two coach-horses a-breast, led the\break
way as slow as a patrole\tsk whilst my\break
uncle \textit{Toby}, in his laced regimentals and\break
tye-wig, kept his rank with my father,\break
\stck{in deep roads and dissertations alternately}\break
upon the advantage of learning and arms,\break
as each could get the start.


\tsk But the painting of this journey, upon reviewing it,
appears to be so much above the stile and manner of any thing else
I have been able to paint in this\break book, that it could not have
remained in it, without depreciating every other scene; and
destroying at the same time that necessary equipoise and
balance,\break
(whether of good or bad) betwixt chapter and chapter, from whence
the just\catch{proportions} proportions and harmony of the whole work results. For my
own part, I am but just set up in the business, so know little
about it\tsk but, in my opinion, to write a book is for all the
world like humming a song\tsk be but in tune with yourself,
madam, ’tis no matter how high or how low you take it.\tsk


\tsk This is the reason, may it please your reverences, that
some of the lowest and flattest compositions pass off
very\break
well\tsk (as \textit{Yorick} told my uncle \textit{Toby} one
night) by siege\tsk My uncle \textit{Toby} looked brisk at
the sound of the word \textit{siege}, but could make neither head or tail of
it.

I’m to preach at court next Sunday, \stick{said
\textit{Homenas}\tsk run over my notes\tsk so I}
humm’d over doctor \textit{Homenas}’s notes\tsk the
modulation’s very well\tsk ’twill do,\catch{\textit{Homenas},}
\textit{Homenas}, if it holds on at this rate\tsk so on I
humm’d\tsk and a tolerable tune I thought it was; and to
this hour, may it please your reverences, had never found
out how low, how flat, how spiritless and jejune it was, but
that all of a sudden, up started an air in the middle of it,
so fine, so rich, so heavenly\tsk it carried my soul up
with it into the other world; now had I, (as
\textit{Montaigne} complained in a parallel accident)\tsk
had I found the declivity easy, or the ascent accessible\tsk
certes I had been outwitted\break
\tsk Your notes, \textit{Homenas}, I should have said, are
good notes,\tsk but it was so per\-pendicular a precipice\tsk
so wholly cut off from the rest of the work, that by
the\break
first note I humm’d, I found myself\break flying into the other
world, and from thence discovered the vale from whence\break
I came, so deep, so low, and dismal,\catch{that}
that I shall never have
the heart to descend into it again.

☞ A dwarf who brings a standard\break
along with him to measure his own size\break
\tsk take my word, is a dwarf in more articles than
one\tsk And so much for tearing out of chapters.

occasion,\tsk that I declare, \textit{Didius}, I would suffer
martyrdom\tsk and if it was possible my horse with me, a
thousand times over, before I would sit down and make such
another: I was delivered of it at the wrong end of me\tsk it

that I revenge myself of it, in this manner.\tsk To preach,

\dropcap{Z}{ounds!}\tsh\tsh\break
\tsh\tsh\tsh\tsh\tsk\break
\tsh\tsh\tsk Z\tsh ds!  cried \textit{Phu-\break tatorius},
partly to himself\tsk and yet high enough to be heard\tsk
and what seemed odd, ’twas uttered in a construction of
look, and in a tone of voice, somewhat between that of a man
in amazement,\break
and of one in bodily pain.

One or two who had very nice ears, and could distinguish the
expression and mixture of the two tones as plainly as a
\textit{third} or a \textit{fifth}, or any other chord in musick\tsk were the most puzzled and perplexed
with it\tsk the \textit{concord} was good in itself\tsk but then
’twas quite out of the\catch{key,}
\stick{key, and no way applicable to the subject}
\stck{started;\tsk so that with all their knowledge,}
they could not tell what in the world to make of it.

Others who knew nothing of musical\break 
\stick{expression, and merely lent their ears to}
the plain import of the \textit{word}, imagined that
\textit{Phutatorius}, who was somewhat of a cholerick spirit, was
just going to snatch \stick{the cudgels out of \textit{Didius}’s
hands, in order} to bemawl \textit{Yorick} to some purpose\tsk and
that the desperate monosyllable Z\tsh ds was the exordium
to an oration, which, as they judged from the sample, presaged but
a rough kind of handling of him;\break 
so that my uncle \textit{Toby}’s good nature felt\break
a pang for what \textit{Yorick} was about to\break undergo. But seeing
\textit{Phutatorius} stop\break short,
without any attempt or desire to go on\tsk a third party began to
suppose,\catch{that}
that it was no more than an involuntary respiration,
casually forming itself into the shape of a twelve-penny
oath\tsk without the sin or substance of one.

Others, and especially one or two who sat next him, looked
upon it on the contrary, as a real and substantial oath
pro\-pensly formed against \textit{Yorick}, to whom he was
known to bear no good liking\tsk\break which said oath, as my
father philosophized upon it, actually lay fretting and
fuming at that very time in the upper regions of
\textit{Phutatorius}’s purtenance; and so was naturally, and
according to the due course of things, first squeezed out by
the sudden influx of blood, which was driven into the right
ventricle of \textit{Phutatorius}’s heart, by the stroke of
surprize which so strange a theory of preaching had excited.\patch{How}

How finely we argue upon mistaken facts!

There was not a soul busied in all these various reasonings upon
the monosyllable which \textit{Phutatorius} uttered,\tsk who did not
take this for granted, proceeding upon it as from an axiom, namely,
that \textit{Phutatorius}’s mind was intent upon the subject of debate which was arising between
\textit{Didius} and \textit{Yorick}; and indeed as he looked first
towards the one, and then towards the other, with the air of a man
listening to what was going forwards,\tsk who would not have
thought the same? But the truth was, that \textit{Phutatorius} knew
not one word or one syllable of what was passing\tsk but his
whole thoughts and attention were taken up with a transaction which
was going forwards at that very instant within the precincts of his
own\catch{\textit{Galli}-} \textit{Galligaskins}, and in a part of them, where of all others
he stood most interested to watch accidents: So that
notwithstanding he looked with all the attention in the world, and
had gradually skrewed up every nerve and muscle in his face, to the
utmost pitch the instrument would bear, in order, as it was
thought, to give a sharp reply to \textit{Yorick}, who sat
over-against him\tsk Yet I say, was \textit{Yorick} never
once in any one domicile of \textit{Phutatorius}’s
brain\tsk but the true cause of his exclamation lay at
least a yard below.

This I will endeavour to explain to you with all imaginable
decency.

You must be informed then, that\break \textit{Gastripheres}, who had
taken a turn into the kitchen a little before dinner, to see 
\stck{how things went on\tsk observing a wicker-}\catch{basket}
basket of fine chesnuts
standing upon the dresser, had ordered that a hundred or two of
them might be roasted and sent\break in, as soon as dinner was
over\tsk \textit{Gastri\-pheres} inforcing his orders about
them, that \textit{Didius}, but \textit{Phutatorius} especially,\break
were particularly fond of ’em.

About two minutes before the time that my uncle \textit{Toby}
interrupted \textit{Yorick}’s
harangue\tsk \textit{Gastripheres}’s chesnuts were \tight{brought
in\tsk and as \textit{Phutatorius}’s fondness} for ’em,
was uppermost in the waiter’s head, he laid them directly
before \textit{Phutatorius}, wrapt up hot in a clean damask
napkin.

Now whether it was physically impossible, with half a dozen
hands all thrust into the napkin at a time\tsk but that some one
chesnut, of more life and rotundity\catch{than} than the rest, must be put in
motion\tsk\break
it so fell out, however, that one was\break
actually sent rolling off the table; and\break
as \textit{Phutatorius} sat straddling
under\tsk it\break fell perpendicularly into that particular
aperture of \textit{Phutatorius}’s breeches, for\break
which, to the shame and indelicacy of\break
our language be it spoke, there is no
chaste word throughout all \textit{Johnson}’s\break
dictionary\tsk let it suffice to say\tsk it was\break
\stck{that particular aperture which, in all good}
societies, the laws of decorum do strictly require, like the temple of \textit{Janus} (in
peace at least) to be universally shut up.

The neglect of this punctilio in \textit{Phutatorius} (which
by the bye should be a\break warning to all mankind) had opened a door to
this accident.\tsh\patch{\tsk Accident,}

\tsk Accident, I call it, in compliance to a received mode of
speaking,\tsk but in no opposition to the opinion either of
\textit{Acrites} or \textit{Mythogeras} in this matter; I know they
were both prepossessed and fully persuaded of it\tsk and are so
to this hour, That there was nothing of accident in the whole
event\tsh but that the chesnut’s taking that particular course, and
in a manner of its own accord\tsk and then falling with all its
heat directly into that one particular place, and no
other\tsh was a real judgment upon \textit{Phutatorius},\break
for that filthy and obscene treatise \textit{de Concubinis retinendis},
which \textit{Phutatorius} had published about twenty years
ago\tsh and was that identical week going to give the
world a second edition of.

It is not my business to dip my pen in this
controversy\tsh much undoubtedly\catch{may} may be wrote on both
sides of the question\tsk all that concerns me as an historian,
is to represent the matter of fact, and render it credible to the
reader, that the hiatus in \textit{Phutatorius}’s breeches was
sufficiently wide to receive the ches\-nut;\break\tsh and that the
chesnut, some how or other, did fall perpendicularly and piping hot
into it, without \textit{Phutatorius}’s perceiving it, or any
one else at that time.

The genial warmth which the chesnut\break imparted, was not
undelectable for the first twenty or five and twenty
seconds,\tsk and did no more than gently solicit
\textit{Phu\-tatorius}’s attention towards the
part:\tsk\break
But the heat gradually increasing, and in a few
seconds more getting beyond the point of all sober pleasure, and
then advancing with all speed into the regions of pain,\tsk the soul of
\textit{Phutatorius}, toge-\catch{ther} ther with all his ideas, his thoughts, his
attention, his imagination, judgment,\break
resolution, deliberation, ratiocination,\break
memory, fancy, with ten battalions of animal
spirits, all tumultuously crouded down, through different defiles
and circuits, to the place of danger, leaving all his upper
regions, as you may imagine, as empty as my purse.

With the best intelligence which all these messengers could
bring him back, \textit{Phutatorius} was not able to dive into the
secret of what was going forwards below, nor could he make any kind
of conjecture, what the devil was the matter with it: However, as
he knew not what the true cause might turn out, he deemed it most
prudent, in the situation he was in at present, to bear it,
if possible, like a stoick;
which, with the help of some\catch{wry}
wry faces and compursions of the
mouth, he had certainly accomplished, had his imagination continued
neuter\tsh but the sallies of the imagination are
ungovernable in things of this kind\tsk a thought instantly
darted into his mind, that tho’ the anguish had the sensation
of glowing heat\tsk it might, notwithstanding that, be a bite as
well as a burn; and if so, that possibly a \textit{Newt} or an
\textit{Asker}, or some such detested reptile, had crept up, and was
fastening his teeth\tsh the horrid idea of which, with a
fresh glow of pain arising that instant from the chesnut, seized
\textit{Phutatorius} with a sudden panick, and in the first
terrifying disorder of the passion it threw him, as it has done
the best generals upon earth, quite off his guard:\tsk the
effect of which was this, that he leapt incontinently up, uttering
as he rose that interjection of surprise so\catch{much} much discanted upon,
with the apo\-sio\-pestick break after it, marked thus,\break
Z\tsh ds\tsk which, though not strictly canonical, was still as little as any man
could have said upon the occasion;\tsh\break and which,
by the bye, whether canonical or not, \textit{Phutatorius} could no
more help than he could the cause of it.

Though this has taken up some time\break in the narrative, it took up
little more time in the transaction, than just to allow time for
\textit{Phutatorius} to draw forth the chesnut, and throw it down
with\break violence upon the floor\tsk and for
\textit{Yorick},\break to rise
from his chair, and pick the chesnut up.

It is curious to observe the triumph of slight incidents over
the mind:\tsh What incredible weight they have in forming\catch{and}
and governing our opinions, both of men and things,\tsk that
trifles, light as air, shall waft a belief into the soul,
and plant it so immoveably within it,\tsk that
\textit{Euclid}’s demonstrations, could they be brought to
batter it in breach, should not all have power to overthrow
it.

\textit{Yorick}, I said, picked up the chesnut which
\textit{Phutatorius}’s wrath had flung\break down\tsk the action
was trifling\tsk I am ashamed to account for it\tsk he did
it,\break
for no reason, but that he thought the chesnut not a jot
worse for the adventure\tsk \tight{and that he held a good chesnut}
worth stooping for.\tsk But this incident, trifling as it
was, wrought differently in \textit{Phutatorius}’s head: He
considered this act of \textit{Yorick}’s, in getting off his
chair, and picking up the chesnut, as a plain acknowledgment
in him, that the ches-\catch{nut} nut was originally his,\tsk and in
course, that it must have been the owner of the chesnut, and
no one else, who could have played him such a prank with it:\break
What greatly confirmed him in this opinion, was this, that
the table being pa\-rallelogramical and very narrow, it
afforded a fair opportunity for \textit{Yorick},\break
who sat directly over-against \textit{Phutatorius},\break
of slipping the chesnut in\tsk and consequently that he did it. The look of
something more than suspicion, which \textit{Phutatorius}
cast full upon \textit{Yorick} as these thoughts arose, too
evidently spoke his 
\stck{opinion\tsk and as \textit{Phutatorius} was naturally}
supposed to know more of the matter than any
person besides, his opinion at once became the general
one;\tsh and for a reason very different from any which have
been yet given\tsh\enlargethispage\baselineskip in a little time it was put out of all
manner of dispute.\patch{When}

When great or unexpected events fall out upon the stage of this
sublunary\break world\tsk the mind of man, which is an
inquisitive kind of a substance, naturally takes a flight behind
the scenes to see what is the cause and first spring
of\break
them\tsk The search was not long in this\break instance.

It was well known that \textit{Yorick} had\break
\stck{never a good opinion of the treatise which}\break
\textit{Phutatorius} had wrote \textit{de Concubinis
retinendis}, as a thing which he feared had done hurt in the
world\tsk and ’twas easily found out, that there was a
mystical meaning in \textit{Yorick}’s prank\tsk and that his
chucking the chesnut hot into \textit{Phutatorius}’s
\hbox{\astw3\tsk\astw5}, 
was a sarcastical fling at his book\tsk the doctrines
of which,\break they said, had enflamed many an honest man in the
same place.\patch{This}

This conceit awaken’d \textit{Somnolentus}\tsh made
\textit{Agelastes} smile\tsk and if you can\break recollect the
precise look and air of a man’s face intent in finding out a
riddle\tsk\stick{it threw \textit{Gastripheres}’s into that
form\tsk} and in short was thought by many to be a master-stroke
of arch-wit.

This, as the reader has seen from one end to the other, was as
groundless as\break the dreams of philosophy: \textit{Yorick}, no\break doubt, as
\textit{Shakespear} said of his ancestor\break\tsk\lqq\textit{was
a man of jest},\,” but it was tem\-per’d with something
which withheld him\break
from that, and many other ungracious\break pranks, of
which he as undeservedly\break
bore the blame;\tsk but it was his
misfortune all his life long to bear the imputation of saying and
doing a thousand \stck{things, of which (unless my esteem blinds} me) his
nature was incapable. All I\catch{blame}
blame him for\tsk or rather, all I blame and alternately like him for, was that
singularity of his temper, which would never suffer him to take pains to set a story
right with the world, however in his power. In every ill usage of that sort, he
acted precisely as in the affair of his lean horse\tsk he could have explained it to
his honour, but his spirit was above it; and besides, he ever looked upon the
inventor, the propagator and believer of an illiberal report alike so injurious to
him\tsk he could not stoop to tell his story to them\tsk and so trusted to time and
truth to do it for him.

This heroic cast produced him inconveniences in many
respects\tsk in the pre\-sent, it was followed by the fixed
resentment of \textit{Phutatorius}, who, as \textit{Yorick} had just
made an end of his chesnut, rose up\catch{from} from his chair a second time,
to let him know it\tsk which indeed he did with a smile; saying
only\tsk that he would endeavour not to forget the
obligation.

But you must mark and carefully separate and distinguish these
two things in your mind.

\tsk The smile was for the company.

\tsk The threat was for \textit{Yorick}.

at the same time to ease and ventilate it\tsh If that is the case, said
\textit{Eugenius}, I would advise you, \textit{Phutatorius}, not to tamper with it

nothing more than twist it round\tsk The damp paper, quoth \textit{Yorick} (who sat

the most anodyne and safe.

Was it my case, said \textit{Gastripheres}, as the main thing is the oil and
lamp-black, I should spread them thick upon a rag, and clap it on directly. That
would make a very devil of it, replied \textit{Yorick}\tsh And besides, added
\textit{Eugenius}, it would not answer the intention, which is the extreame neatness

\stick{his fingers spread upon his breast\tsk had}
such a blunder about a christian-name
happened before the reformation\tsk (It 
\stck{happened the day before yesterday, quoth}
my uncle \textit{Toby} to himself) and when\break
baptism was administer’d in
\textit{Latin}\tsh\break
\stick{(’Twas all in \textit{English}, said my
uncle)}\break
\tsk Many things might have coincided\break with it, and
upon the authority of sundry decreed cases, to have pronounced the
baptism null, with a power of giving\catch{the}
\stick{the child a new name\tsk Had a priest, for}
\stck{instance, which was no uncommon thing,}
through ignorance of the \textit{Latin} tongue, baptized a child of
Tom-o’Stiles, \textit{in\break nomino patriæ \et\ filia \et\
spiritum sanctos},\break\tsk the baptism was held
null\tsk I beg your pardon, replied
\textit{Kysarcius},\tsk in that case, as the mistake was only
the \textit{terminations}, the baptism was valid\tsh and to
have rendered it null, the blunder of the priest should have fallen
upon the first syllable of each noun\tsh and not, as in
your case, upon the last.\tsk

My father delighted in subtleties of this kind, and
listen’d with infinite attention.

\textit{Gastripheres}, for example, continued \textit{Kysarcius},
baptizes a child of \textit{John\break Stradling}’s \textit{in Gomine}
gatris, \etc \et{\itshape c}.\catch{instead} instead of \textit{in Nomine} patris,
\etc\tsk Is this\break
a baptism? No,\tsk say the ablest cano\-nists; in as much as the radix of each word is hereby torn up,
and the sense\break
and meaning of them removed and\break
changed quite to another object; for\break
\textit{Gomine} does not signify a name, nor\break
\textit{gatris} a father\tsk What do they signify?\break
said my uncle \textit{Toby}\tsk Nothing at all\tsk\break
quoth \textit{Yorick}\tsk Ergo, such a baptism is\break
null, said \textit{Kysarcius}\tsk In course, answered\break
\textit{Yorick}, in a tone two parts jest and one\break
part earnest\tsk

But in the case cited, continued \textit{Kysarcius}, where
\textit{patrim} is put for \textit{patris}, \textit{filia}
for \textit{filij}, and so on\tsk as it is a fault only in
the declension, and the roots of the words continue
untouch’d, the inflexions of their branches, either this way
or\break that, does not in any sort hinder the\catch{baptism,} baptism,
inasmuch as the same sense\break continues in the words as
before.\tsk But then, said \textit{Didius}, the intention of
the priest’s pronouncing them grammatically, must have been
proved to have gone along with it\tsk Right, answered
\textit{Kysarcius}; and of this, brother \textit{Didius}, we
have an instance in a decree of the de\-cretals of Pope
\textit{Leo} the IIId.\tsk But my brother’s child, cried my
uncle \textit{Toby},\break
has nothing to do with the Pope\tsk ’tis\break
the plain child of a Protestant gentle-\break
man, christen’d \textit{Tristram} against the wills\break
and wishes both of his father and mother,\break
and all who are a-kin to it.\tsk

If the wills and wishes, said \textit{Kysarcius}, interrupting my
uncle \textit{Toby}, of those only who stand related to Mr.\@
\textit{Shandy}’s child, were to have weight in this matter,
Mrs.\@ \textit{Shandy}, of all people, has the\catch{least} least to do in
it.\tsk My uncle \textit{Toby} lay’d down his pipe, and my father drew his chair still closer to
the table, to hear the conclusion of so strange an
introduction.

It has not only been a question,\break captain \textit{Shandy}, amongst the
\lower-3pt\hbox{\ast} best law\-yers and civilians in this land,
continued \textit{Kys\-arcius}, \lqq\textit{Whether the
mother be of kin}\break

dispas\-sionate enquiry and jactitation of the arguments on
all sides\tsk it has been adjudged for the negative\tsk
namely, \lqq\textit{That}\break
\lqq \textit{the mother is not of kin to her child}\,\dagger.”\break
My father instantly clapp’d his hand\break

of so curious an argument\tsk he begg’d my
uncle \textit{Toby}, for heaven’s sake, not to disappoint him in it\tsk My uncle
\textit{Toby} gave a nod\tsk resumed his pipe, and
content-\break ing himself with whistling
\textit{Lillabullero}\break
inwardly\tsh \textit{Kysarcius}, \textit{Didius}, and
\textit{Triptolemus} went on with the discourse as follows.

This determination, continued \textit{Kysarcius}, how
contrary soever it may seem\break
to run to the stream of vulgar ideas,\break
yet had reason strongly on its side; and has been put out of all
manner of dispute from the famous case, known commonly by the name
of the Duke of \textit{Suffolk}’s case:\tsh It is
cited in \textit{Brook}, said \textit{Triptolemus}\tsh And
taken notice of by Lord \textit{Coke}, added \textit{Didius}\tsk And
you may find it in \textit{Swinburn} on Testaments, said
\textit{Kysarcius.}\patch{The}

The case, Mr.\@ \textit{Shandy}, was this.

In the reign of \textit{Edward} the Sixth,\break
\textit{Charles} Duke of \textit{Suffolk} having issue a son
by one venter, and a daughter by\break
another venter, made his last will,\break
wherein he devised goods to his son,\break
and died; after whose death the son died also\tsk but
without will, without wife, and without child\tsk his mother and
his sister by the father’s side (for she was born of the
former venter) then living. The mother took the administration of
her son’s goods, according to the statute of the 21st of \textit{Harry} the Eighth, whereby it is
enacted, That in case any person\break die intestate, the administration
of his goods shall be committed to the next\break of kin.\patch{The}

The administration being thus (surreptitiously) granted to the
mother, the sister by the father’s side commenced a suit
before the Ecclesiastical Judge, al\-ledging, 1st, That she herself
was next of kin; and 2dly, That the mother was not of kin at all to
the party deceased;\break and therefore pray’d the court, that the
administration granted to the mother\break might be revoked, and be
committed\break unto her, as next of kin to the deceased, by force of the
said statute.

Hereupon, as it was a great cause, and much depending upon its issue\tsk and many
causes of great property likely to be decided in times to come, by the precedent to
be then made\tsh the most learned, as well in the laws of this realm, as in the
civil law, were consulted together, whether the mother was
of kin to\catch{her} her son, or no.
\tsk Whereunto not only the temporal lawyers\tsk but the church lawyers\tsk the
juris consulti\tsk the juris-prudentes\tsk the civilians\tsk the advocates\tsk the
commissaries\tsk the judges of the consistory and prerogative courts of
\textit{Canterbury} and \textit{York}, with the master of the faculties, were all
unanimously of opinion, That the mother was not of \fnast\break
kin to her child.\tsh

And what said the Duchess of \textit{Suffolk} to it? said my uncle
\textit{Toby}.

The unexpectedness of my uncle\break
\textit{Toby}’s question, confounded \textit{Kysarcius}\break
more than the ablest advocate\tsh He\break
stopp’d a full minute, looking in my\break
uncle \textit{Toby}’s face without replying\tsh\break
\rightline{and}

\newpage\noindent
and in that single minute \textit{Triptolemus} put by him, and took the lead as
follows.

’Tis a ground and principle in the law, said \textit{Triptolemus}, that things do
not ascend, but descend in it; and I make no doubt ’tis for this cause, that however
true it is, that the child may be of the blood and seed of its parents\tsk that the
parents, nevertheless, are not of the\break blood and seed of it; inasmuch as the parents
are not begot by the child, but\break the child by the parents\tsk For so they write,
\textit{Liberi sunt de sanguine patris \et\break matris, sed
pater et mater non sunt de sanguine liberorum.}

\tsk But this, \textit{Triptolemus}, cried \textit{Didius}, proves too much\tsk for from this
authority cited it would follow, not only\break
what indeed is granted on all sides,\catch{that}
that the mother is not of kin to her\break
child\tsk but the father likewise\tsh It is\break 
held, said \textit{Triptolemus}, the better opi-\break
nion; because the father, the mother,\break
and the child, though they be three\break
persons, yet are they but (\textit{una caro} \fnast)\break
one flesh; and consequently no degree\break
of kindred\tsk or any method of acquiring 
one \textit{in nature.}\tsk There you push the argument again too far,
cried \textit{Didius}\tsh\break
for there is no prohibition \textit{in nature},\break
though there is in the levitical law,\tsk\break
but that a man may beget a child upon\break
his grandmother\tsh in which case, supposing
the issue a daughter, she would stand in relation both
of\tsh But who\break
ever thought, cried \textit{Kysarcius}, of laying with his
grandmother?\tsk The young\break
gentleman, replied \textit{Yorick}, whom \textit{Selden}\break

with the subtleties of these\break learned
discourses\tsh ’twas still but like the anointing of
a broken bone\tsh The\break
moment he got home, the weight of\break
his afflictions returned upon him but so much the heavier, as is

\textit{Hippocrates} tells us\tsk he had certainly fallen ill with
the extinction of them, had not his thoughts been criti-\catch{cally} cally drawn
off, and his health rescued by a fresh train of disquietudes left
him, with a legacy of a thousand pounds by my aunt
\textit{Dinah}\tsk

My father had scarce read the letter, when taking the thing by
the right end, 
\stick{he instantly began to plague and puzzle}
\stick{his head how to lay it out mostly to}
\stick{the honour of his family.\tsk A hundred}
\stick{and fifty odd projects took possession}
\stick{of his brains by turns\tsk he would do}
\stick{this, and that, and to’ther\tsk He would}\sic\break
\stick{go to \textit{Rome}\tsk he would go to law\tsk he}
\stick{would buy stock\tsk he would buy \textit{John}}
\stick{\textit{Hobson}’s farm\tsk he would new fore-front}
\stick{his house, and add a new wing to make}
\stick{it even\tsk There was a fine water-mill on}
this side, and he would build a wind-mill on the
other side of the river in full view to answer it\tsk But above
all\catch{things} things in the world, he would inclose the great \textit{Ox-moor}, 
and send out my brother \textit{Bobby} immediately upon his
travels.

But as the sum was \textit{finite}, and consequently could not do
every thing\tsk and in truth very few of these to any
purpose,\tsk of all the projects which offered themselves
upon this occasion, the two last seemed to make the deepest
impression; and he would infallibly have determined upon
both at once, but for the small inconvenience hinted at
above, which absolutely put him under a necessity of
deciding in favour either of the one or the other.

This was not altogether so easy to be done; for though
’tis certain my father had long before set his heart upon
this necessary part of my brother’s education,\catch{and} and like a
prudent man had actually\break
determined to carry it into execution,\break
with the first money that returned from the second creation of
actions in the \textit{Missisippi}-scheme, in which he was an
adventurer\tsh yet the \textit{Ox-moor}, which was a fine,
large, whinny, undrained, unim-\break
\tight{proved common, belonging to the \textit{Shandy}-}\break
estate, had almost as old a claim upon him: he had
long and affectionately set 
\stck{his heart upon turning it likewise to some}
account.

\tight{But having never hitherto been pressed} with such a conjuncture
of things, as made it necessary to settle either the\break priority or justice of their
claims,\tsk like a
wise man he had refrained entering into any nice or critical
examination about them: So that upon the dismission of every other
project at this crisis,\tsh\catch{the} the two old projects, the
O\textsc{x-moor} and my \textsc{Brother}, divided him
again; and so equal a match were they for each other, as to become
the occasion of no small contest in the old gentleman’s
mind,\tsk which of the two should be set o’going first.

\tsk People may laugh as they will\tsh but the case
was this.

It had ever been the custom of the family, and by length of time
was almost become a matter of common right, that the eldest son of
it should have free ingress, egress, and regress into foreign parts
before marriage,\tsk not only for the sake of bettering his own
private parts, by the benefit of exercise and change of so much
air\tsk but simply for the mere delectation of his fancy, by the
feather\catch{put}
put into his cap, of having been abroad\break
\tsk \textit{tantum valet}, my father would say,
\textit{quantum sonat}.

Now as this was a reasonable, and in course a most christian
indulgence\tsh to deprive him of it, without why or\break
wherefore,\tsh and thereby make an example of him, as the
first \textit{Shandy} unwhirl’d about \textit{Europe} in a
post-chaise, and only because he was a heavy lad\tsh would
be using him ten times worse than a \textit{Turk.}

On the other hand, the case of the\break \textit{Ox-moor} was full as
hard.

Exclusive of the original purchase-\break
money, which was eight hundred pounds\break
\tsk it had cost the family eight hundred
pounds more in a law-suit about fifteen\catch{years}
years before\tsk besides the Lord knows what trouble and vexation.

It had been moreover in possession of the \textit{Shandy}-family
ever since the middle of the last century; and though it lay full
in view before the house, bounded on one extremity by the
water-mill, and on the other by the projected wind-mill
spoken of above,\tsk and for all these reasons
seemed to have the fairest title of any part of the estate to the
care and protection of the family\tsk yet by an unaccountable
fatality, common to men, as well as the ground they tread
on,\tsk it had all along most shamefully been
overlook’d; and to speak the truth of it, had suffered so
much by it, that it would have made any man’s heart have bled
\sic\textit{( Obadiah} said ) who understood the value of the land, to have
rode over\catch{it,} it, and only seen the condition it was in.

However, as neither the purchasing this tract of
ground\tsk nor indeed the placing of it where it lay, were either
of them, properly speaking, of my father’s
doing\tsk he had never thought himself any way concerned
in the affair\tsk till the fifteen years before, when the
breaking out of that cursed law-suit mentioned above (and which had
arose about its boundaries)\tsk which being altogether my
father’s own act and deed, it naturally awakened every other
argument in its favour; and upon summing them all up
together, he saw, not merely in interest, but in honour, he was
bound to do something for it\tsk and that now or never was
the time.\patch{I think}

I think there must certainly have been a mixture of ill-luck in
it, that the reasons on both sides should happen to be so equally
balanced by each other; for though my father weigh’d them in
all\break humours and conditions\tsk spent many an anxious hour
in the most profound and abstracted meditation upon what was\break
best to be done\tsh reading books of farming one
day\tsk books of travels another\tsk laying aside
all passion whatever\break\tsk viewing the arguments on both sides in
all their lights and circumstances\tsk\break communing every day with
my uncle\break \textit{Toby}\tsk arguing with \textit{Yorick}, and talking
over the whole affair of the \textit{Ox-moor}\break with
\textit{Obadiah}\tsk yet nothing in all that time appeared
so strongly in behalf of the one, which was not either
strictly\break
applicable to the other, or at least so\break far counterbalanced
by some considera-\catch{tion}
tion of equal weight, as to keep the scales even.

For to be sure, with proper helps,\break
and in the hands of some people, tho’\break
the \textit{Ox-moor} would undoubtedly have\break
made a different appearance in the world from what it did, or ever would
do in the condition it lay\tsk yet every tittle of this
was true, with regard to my brother \textit{Bobby}\tsk let
\textit{Obadiah} say what he\break
would.\tsh

In point of interest\tsk the contest, I own, at first
sight, did not appear so\break
undecisive betwixt them; for whenever my
father took pen and ink in hand,\break and set about calculating the
simple expence of paring and burning, and fence\-ing in the
\textit{Ox-moor}, \&c.\@ \&c.\tsk with the\break
certain profit it would bring him in\catch{return} return\tsk the latter turned out so
prodigiously in his way of working the account, that you would have
sworn the \textit{Ox-moor} would have carried all before it. For it
was plain he should reap a hundred lasts of rape, at twenty pounds a last, the very first
year\tsk besides an excellent crop of wheat the year
following\tsk and the year after that, to speak within
bounds, a hundred\tsh but, in all likelihood, a hundred and
fifty\tsk if not two hundred quarters of pease and
beans\tsk besides potatoes without end\tsk But
then, to think he was all this while breeding up my brother, like a
hog to eat them\tsk knocked all on the head again, and
generally left the old gentleman in such a state of
suspence\tsk that, as he often declared to my uncle
\textit{Toby}\tsk he knew no more than his heels what to
do.\patch{No}

No body, but he who has felt it, can conceive what a plaguing
thing it is to have a man’s mind torn asunder by two projects
of equal strength, both obsti-\break nately pulling in a contrary direction
at the same time: For to say nothing of\break
the havock, which by a certain conse\-quence is unavoidably made by it all\break
over the finer system of the nerves,\break
which you know convey the animal\break
spirits and more subtle juices from the heart to the head, and so on\tsk It is\break
not to be told in what a degree such a wayward kind of friction works
upon the more gross and solid parts, wasting the fat and impairing
the strength of a man every time as it goes backwards and
forwards.

My father had certainly sunk under this evil, as certainly as he
had done\catch{under} under that of my \ls{\textsc{christian
name}}\tsh\break had he not been rescued out of it as\break
he was out of that, by a fresh evil\tsh\break the misfortune of my
brother \textit{Bobby}’s\break death.

What is the life of man! Is it not to shift from side to
side?\tsk from sorrow to sorrow?\tsh to button up
one cause of vexation!\tsk and unbutton another!

\section{\lsss{CHAP}.\enspace XXXII.}

\dropcap{F}{rom} this moment I am to be\break
considered as heir-apparent to the \textit{Shandy}
family\tsk and it is from this point
\stick{properly, that the story of my \textsc{Life}}
\stick{and my \textsc{Opinions} sets out; with all} 
my hurry and precipitation, I have but\catch{been}
been clearing the ground to raise the\break
building\tsh and such a building do I\break
foresee it will turn out, as never was planned, and as never was executed since
\textit{Adam}. In less than five minutes I shall have thrown
my pen into the fire, and the little drop of thick ink which
is left remaining at the bottom of my ink-horn, after it\tsh
I have but half a score\break things to do in the time\tsh I have
a thing to name\tsh a thing to lament\tsh a thing to
hope\tsh a thing to promise, and a thing to threaten\tsk I
have a thing to suppose\tsk a thing to declare\tsh a thing
to conceal\tsh a thing to chuse, and a thing to pray
for.\tsh This chapter, therefore, I \textit{name} the chapter
of \textsc{Things}\tsh\break 
and my next chapter to it, that is, the\break
first chapter of my next volume, if I live,\break
shall be my chapter upon \lss{\textsc{whiskers}},\catch{in}
in order to keep up some sort of connection in my works.

The thing I lament is, that things\break
have crowded in so thick upon me,\break
that I have not been able to get into\break
that part of my work, towards which,\break
I have all the way, looked forwards,\break
with so much earnest desire; and that is\break
the campaigns, but especially the amours\break
of my uncle \textit{Toby}, the events of which\break
are of so singular a nature, and so Cer-\break
vantick a cast, that if I can so manage\break
it, as to convey but the same impressions\break
to every other brain, which the occur-\break
rences themselves excite in my own\tsh\break
I will answer for it the book shall make\break
its way in the world, much better\break
than its master has done before it\tsh\break
Oh \textit{Tristram!} \textit{Tristram!} can this but\break
be once brought about\tsh the credit,\catch{which}
which will attend thee as an author,\break
\tight{shall counterbalance the many evils which}\break
have befallen thee as a man\tsk thou wilt\break
feast upon the one\tsh when thou hast\break
lost all sense and remembrance of the\break 
other!\tsh

No wonder I itch so much as I do,\break to get at these
amours\tsk They are the\break choicest morsel of my whole story! and
\stick{when I do get at ’em\tsk assure yourselves,}
\stick{good folks,\tsk (nor do I value whose}
\stick{squeamish stomach takes offence at it)}\break
I shall not be at all nice in the choice of my words;\tsh
and that’s the thing I have to \textit{declare}.\tsk I shall
never get all through in five minutes, that I fear\tsh and
the thing I \textit{hope} is, that your worships and
reverences are not offended\tsk if you are, depend upon’t
I’ll give you something, my good gentry, next year,\catch{to} to be
offended at\tsh that’s my dear \textit{Jenny}’s way\tsk but
who my \textit{Jenny} is\tsk\break
and which is the right and which the wrong end of a woman, is the thing to be
\textit{concealed}\tsk it shall be told you the next
chapter but one, to my chapter of button-holes,\tsk and not
one chapter before.


And now that you have just got to\break
the end of these four volumes\tsk\tsk the\break
thing I have to \textit{ask} is, how you feel\break
your heads? my own akes dismally\tsk\break
as for your healths, I know, they are\break
much better\tsh True \textit{Shandeism}, think\break
what you will against it, opens the\break
heart and lungs, and like all those affections which
partake of its nature, it forces the blood and other vital
fluids of the body to run freely thro’ its channels,\catch{and} and makes
the wheel of life run long and chearfully round.

Was I left like \textit{Sancho Pança}, to\break
chuse my kingdom, it should not be\break
maritime\tsk or a kingdom of blacks to make a penny of\tsh no, it should\break
be a kingdom of hearty laughing subjects: And as the bilious and more
sa\-turnine passions, by creating disorders\break
in the blood and humours, have as bad\break
\stick{an influence, I see, upon the body politick}
\stick{as body natural\tsh and as nothing but a}
habit of virtue can fully govern those passions, and subject them to
reason\tsh I should add to my prayer\tsk that God would give
my subjects grace to be as \ls{\textsc{wise}} as they were
\ls{\textsc{merry}}; and then\break should I be the happiest monarch,
and they the happiest people under heaven\tsk\patch{And}

And so, with this moral for the pre-\break
sent, may it please your worships and\break
your reverences, I take my leave of you\break
till this time twelve-month, when (unless\break
this vile cough kills me in the mean\break
time) I’ll have another pluck at your\break
beards, and lay open a story to the\break
world you little dream of.
