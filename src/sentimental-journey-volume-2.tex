\dropcap{W}{hat} the old French officer\break
had deliver’d upon travel-\break
\stick{ling, bringing Polonius’s advice to}
\stck{his son upon the same subject into my}
\stick{head\tskk and that bringing in Hamlet;}
\stick{and Hamlet, the rest of Shakespear’s}
\stick{works, I stopp’d at the Quai de}
\stick{Conti in my return home, to pur-}
chase the whole set.


\patchv[\baselineskip]{B}{The}

The bookseller said he had not a\break
\stick{set in the world\tskk\i{Comment!} said I;}
\stick{taking one up out of a set which lay}
\stick{upon the counter betwixt us.\tsh He}
\stick{said, they were sent him only to be}
\stick{got bound, and were to be sent back}
\stick{to Versailles in the morning to the}
Count de B\anon.

\tskk And does the Count de B\anon\break
\stick{said I, read Shakespear?  \i{C’est un}}
\stick{\i{Esprit fort}; replied the bookseller.\tskk}
\stick{He loves English books; and what}
\stick{is more to his honour, Monsieur,}
\stick{he love the English too.  You speak}
\stick{this so civilly, said I, that ’tis enough}
\stick{to oblige an Englishman to lay out a}
\stick{Louis d’or or two at your shop\tskk the}
\stick{bookseller made a bow, and was}
\catch{going}
\stck{going to say something, when a young}
\stick{decent girl of about twenty, who by}
\stick{her air and dress, seemed to be \i{fille}}
\stick{\i{de chambre} to some devout woman of}
\stck{fashion, came into the shop and asked}
\stick{for \i{Les Egarments du Cœur \et\ de l’Es}-}
\stick{\i{prit:} the bookseller gave her the book}
\stick{directly; she pulled out a little green}
\stick{sattin purse run round with a ribband}
\stick{of the same colour, and putting her}
\stick{finger and thumb into it, she took out}
\stck{the money, and paid for it. As I had no-}
\stick{thing more to stay me in the shop, we}
both walked out at the door together.

\tsk And what have you to do,\break
\stick{my dear, said I, with \i{The Wanderings}}
\stick{\i{of the Heart}, who scarce know yet}
\stick{you have one? nor till love has}
\catchs{B 2}{first}
\stick{first told you it, or some faithless}
\stck{shepherd has made it ache, can’st thou}
\stick{ever be sure it is so.\tskk \i{Le Dieu m’en}}
\stick{\i{guard!} said the girl.\tskk With reason,}
\stick{said I\tsk for if\sic is a good one, ’tis pity}
\stick{it should be stolen: ’tis a little trea-}
\stick{sure to thee, and gives a better air}
\stick{to your face, than if it was dress’d}
out with pearls.

The young girl listened with a\break
\stick{submissive attention, holding her sat-}
\stick{tin purse by its ribband in her hand}
\stick{all the time\tskk ’Tis a very small one,}
\stick{said I, taking hold of the bottom of}
\stick{it\tskk she held it towards me\tskk and}
\stick{there is very little in it, my dear, said}
\stick{I; but be but as good as thou art hand-}
\stick{some, and heaven will fill it:  I had a}
\catch{parcel}
\stick{parcel of crowns in my hand to pay}
\stick{for Shakespear; and, as she had let go}
\stick{the purse intirely, I put a single one}
\stick{in; and tying up the ribband in a}
bow-knot, returned it to her.

The young girl made me more a\break
\stick{humble courtesy than a low one\tskk}
\stick{’twas one of those quiet, thankful}
\stick{sinkings where the spirit bows itself}
\stick{down\tskk the body does no more than}
\stick{tell it.  I never gave a girl a crown}
\stick{in my life which gave me half the}
pleasure.

My advice, my dear, would not\break
\stick{have been worth a pin to you, said}
\stick{I, if I had not given this along with}
\stick{it: but now, when you see the crown,}
\catchs{B 3}{you’ll}
\stick{you’ll remember it\tskk so don’t, my}
dear, lay it out in ribbands.

Upon my word, Sir, said the\break
\stick{girl, earnestly, I am incapable\tskk in}
\stick{saying which, as is usual in little bar-}
\stick{gains of honour, she gave me her}
\stick{hand\tskk \i{En verite}, \i{Monsieur}, \i{je met}-}
\i{trai cet argent apart}, said she.

When a virtuous convention is\break
\stick{made betwixt man and woman, it}
\stick{sanctifies their most private walks:}
\stick{so notwithstanding it was dusky, yet}
\stick{as both our roads lay the same way,}
\stick{we made no scruple of walking along}
the Quai de Conti together.

\patch[\baselineskip]{She}

She made me a second courtesy in\break
\stick{setting off, and before we got twenty}
\stick{yards from the door, as if she had}
\stick{not done enough before, she made a}
\stick{sort of a little stop to tell me again,}
\tskk she thank’d me.

It was a small tribute, I told her,\break
\stick{which I could not avoid paying to}
\stick{virtue, and would not be mistaken in}
\stick{the person I had been rendering it to}
\stick{for the world\tskk but I see innocence,}
\stick{my dear, in your face\tskk and foul be-}
\stick{fall the man who ever lays a snare in}
its way!

The girl seem’d affected some way\break
\stick{or other with what I said\tskk she gave}
\stick{a low sigh\tskk I found I was not im-}
\catchs{B 4}{powered}
\stick{powered to enquire at all after it\tskk so}
\stick{said nothing more till I got to the}
\stck{corner of the Rue de Nevers, where we}
were to part.

\tskk\tighter{But is this the way, my dear, said I,}\break
\stck{to the hotel de Modene?  she told me it}
\stick{was\tskk or, that I might go by the Rue}
\stick{de Guineygaude, which was the next}
\stick{turn.\tskk Then I’ll go, my dear, by the}
\stick{Rue de Guineygaude, said I, for two}
\stck{reasons; first I shall please myself, and}
\stick{next I shall give you the protection of}
\stick{my company as far on your way as I}
\stick{can.  The girl was sensible I was civil}
\stick{\tskk and said, she wish’d the hotel de}
\stick{Modene was in the Rue de St.\@ Pierre\tsk}
\stick{\tskk You live there? said I.\tskk She told}
\stck{me she was \i{fille de chambre} to Madame}
\catch{R\anon}
\stick{\i{R}\anon\sic\tskk Good God!\@ said I, ’tis the}
\stick{very lady for whom I have brought a}
\stck{letter from Amiens\tskk The girl told me}
\stick{that Madame \i{R}\anon\sic, she believed}
\stick{expected a stranger with a letter, and}
\stk{was impatient to see him\tskk so I desired}
\stick{the girl to present my compliments to}
\stck{Madame R\anon, and say I would cer-}
tainly wait upon her in the morning.

\tighter{We stood still at the corner of the Rue}\break
\stk{de Nevers whilst this pass’d\tskk We then}
\stick{stopp’d a moment whilst she disposed}
\stick{of her \i{Egarments de\sic Cœur}, \&c. more}
\stick{commodiously than carrying them in}
\stick{her hand\tskk they were two volumes;}
\stick{so I held the second for her whilst she}
\stick{put the first into her pocket; and then}
\catch{she}
\stick{she held her pocket, and I put in the}
other after it.

\tight{’Tis sweet to feel by what fine-spun}\break
\stick{threads our affections are drawn to-}
gether.

We set off a-fresh, and as she took\break
\stick{her third step, the girl put her hand}
\stick{within my arm\tskk I was just bidding}
\stick{her\tskk but she did it of herself with}
\stick{that undeliberating simplicity, which}
\stick{shew’d it was out of her head that}
\stick{she had never seen me before.  For}
\stick{my own part, I felt the conviction of}
\stck{consanguinity so strongly, that I could}
\stick{not help turning half round to look in}
\stick{her face, and see if I could trace out}
\catch{any}
\stick{any  thing in it of a family likeness\tsk}
Tut! said I, are we not all relations?

When we arrived at the turning up\break
\stick{of the Rue de Guineygaude, I stopp’d}
\stick{to bid her adieu for good an all: the}
\stick{girl would thank me again for my}
\stick{company and kindness\tskk She bid me}
\stick{adieu twice\tskk I repeated it as often;}
\stck{and so cordial was the parting between}
\stick{us, that had it happen’d any where}
\stick{else, I’m not sure but I should have}
\stick{signed it with a kiss of charity, as}
warm and holy as an apostle.

\tight{But in Paris, as none kiss each other}\break
\stick{but the men\tskk I did, what amounted}
to the same thing\tsh

\tsh I bid God bless her.

\dropcap{W}{hen} I got home to my\break
hotel, La Fleur told me I\break
\stick{had been enquired after by the Lieu-}
\stick{tenant de Police\tskk The duce take it!}
\stick{said I\tskk\!\tskk I know the reason.  It is}
\stick{time the reader should know it, for}
\stick{in the order of things in which it}
\stick{happened, it was omitted; not that}
\stick{it was out of my head; but that had}
\stick{I told it then, it might have been}
\stick{forgot now\tskk and now is the time I}
want it.

I had left London with so much\break
\stick{precipitation, that it never enter’d my}
\catch{mind}
\stck{mind that we were at war with France;}
\stick{and had reach’d Dover, and look’d}
\stick{through my glass at the hills beyond}
\stick{Boulogne, before the idea presented}
\stick{itself; and with this in its train, that}
\stick{there was no getting there without a}
\stick{passport.  Go but to the end of a}
\stick{street, I have a mortal aversion for}
\stick{returning back no wiser than I sat\sic}
\stick{out; and as this was one of the great-}
\stick{est efforts I had ever made for know-}
\stick{ledge, I could less bear the thoughts}
\stick{of it: so hearing the Count de\anon}
\stick{had hired the packet, I begg’d he}
\stick{would take me in his \i{suite}.  The}
\stick{Count had some little knowledge of}
\stick{me, so made little or no difficulty\tskk}
\stick{only said, his inclination to serve me}
\stick{could reach no farther than Calais;}
\catch{as}
\stck{as he was to return by way of Brussels}
\stick{to Paris: however, when I had once}
\stick{pass’d there, I might get to Paris}
\stick{without interruption; but that in}
\stick{Paris I must make friends and shift}
\stick{for myself.\tskk Let me get to Paris,}
\stick{Monsieur le Count, said I\tskk and I}
\stick{shall do very well.  So I embark’d,}
\stick{and never thought more of the}
matter.

When La Fleur told me the Lieu-\break
\stick{tenant de Police had been enquiring}
\stck{after me\tskk the thing instantly recurred}
\stick{\tskk and by the time La Fleur had well}
\stick{told me, the master of the hotel}
\stick{came into my room to tell me the}
\stick{same thing, with this addition to it,}
\stick{that my passport had been particu-}
\catch{larly}
\stick{larly ask’d after: the master of the}
\stick{hotel concluded with saying, He}
\stick{hoped I had one.\tskk Not I, faith!}
said I.

The master of the hotel retired\break
\stick{three steps from me, as from an in-}
\stick{fected person, as I declared this\tsk and}
\stick{poor La Fleur advanced three steps}
\stick{towards me, and with that sort of}
\stick{movement which a good soul makes}
\stck{to succour a distress’d one\tsk the fellow}
\stick{won my heart by it; and from that}
\stick{single \i{trait}, I knew his character as}
\stick{perfectly, and could rely upon it as}
\stick{firmly, as if he had served me with}
fidelity for seven years.

\patch[\baselineskip]{Mon}

Mon seignior! cried the master of\break
\stick{the hotel\tsk but recollecting himself}
\stick{as he made the exclamation, he in-}
\stick{stantly changed the tone of it\tskk If}
\stick{Monsieur, said he, has not a passport}
\stick{(\i{apparament}) in all likelihood he has}
\stick{friends in Paris who can procure him}
\stick{one.\tskk Not that I know of, quoth I,}
\stick{with an air of indifference.\tskk Then}
\stick{\i{certes}, replied he, you’ll be sent to the}
\stck{Bastile or the Chatelet, \i{au moins}. Poo!}
\stick{said I, the King of France is a good na-}
\stck{tured soul\tskk he’ll hurt no body.\tskk \i{Cela}}
\stick{\i{n’empeche pas}, said he\tskk you will cer-}
\stck{tainly be sent to the Bastile to-morrow}
\stick{morning.\tskk But I’ve taken your lodg-}
\stick{ings for a month, answer’d I, and I’ll}
\stick{not quit them a day before the time}
\stick{for all the kings of France in the}
\catch{world.}
\stick{world.  La Fleur whisper’d in my}
\stick{ear, That no body could oppose the}
king of France.

\i{Pardi!} said my host, \i{ces Messieurs}\break

\initial[nindent=1pt]{I}{COULD} not find in my heart\break
to torture La Fleur’s with a se-\break
\stick{rious look upon the subject of my}
\stick{embarrassment, which was the rea-}
\stick{son I had treated it so cavalierly: and}
\stick{to shew him how light it lay upon}
\stick{my mind, I dropt the subject en-}
\stick{tirely; and whilst he waited upon me}
\stick{at supper, talk’d to him with more}
\stick{than usual gaiety about Paris, and of}
\stick{the opera comique.\tskk La Fleur had}
\stick{been there himself, and had followed}
\stick{me through the streets as far as the}
\stck{bookseller’s shop; but seeing me come}
\catch{out}
\stick{out with the young \i{fille de chambre},}
\stick{and that we walk’d down the Quai de}
\stick{Conti together, La Fleur deem’d it}
\stick{unnecessary to follow me a step fur-}
\stick{ther\tskk so making his own reflections}
\stick{upon it, he took a shorter cut\tsh}
\stick{and got to the hotel in time to be in-}
\stick{form’d of the affair of the Police}
against my arrival.

As soon as the honest creature had\break
\stick{taken away, and gone down to sup}
\stick{himself, I then began to think a}
little seriously about my situation.\tskk

\tskk And here, I know, Eugenius,\break
\stick{thou wilt smile at the remembrance}
\stick{of a short dialogue which pass’d be-}
\catchs{C 2}{twixt}
\stick{twixt us the moment I was going to}
set out\tsh I must tell it here.

Eugenius, knowing that I was as\break
\stick{little subject to be overburthen’d with}
\stick{money as thought, had drawn me}
\stick{aside to interrogate me how much I}
\stick{had taken care for; upon telling him}
\stick{the exact sum, Eugenius shook his}
\stick{head, and said it would not do; so}
\stick{pull’d out his purse in order to empty}
\stick{it into mine.\tskk I’ve enough in con-}
\stick{science, Eugenius, said I.\tsh Indeed,}
\stick{Yorick, you have not, replied Eu-}
\stick{genius\tskk I know France and Italy}
\stick{better than you.\tsh But you don’t}
\stick{consider, Eugenius, said I, refusing}
\stick{his offer, that before I have been}
\stick{three days in Paris, I shall take care}
\catch{to}
\stick{to say or do something or other for}
\stick{which I shall get clapp’d up into the}
\stick{Bastile, and that I shall live there a}
\stick{couple of months entirely at the king}
\stick{of France’s expence.\tskk I beg pardon,}
\stick{said Eugenius, drily: really, I had}
forgot that resource.

Now the event I treated gaily\break
came seriously to my door.

Is it folly, or nonchalance, or phi-\break
\stick{losophy, or pertinacity\tskk or what is}
\stick{it in me, that, after all, when La}
\stick{Fleur had gone down stairs, and I}
\stick{was quite alone, that I could not}
\stick{bring down my mind to think of it}
\stick{otherwise than I had then spoken of}
it to Eugenius?

\patchs{C 3}{\tsk And}


\tskk And as for the Bastile! the ter-\break
\stick{ror is in the word\tskk Make the most}
\stick{of it you can, said I to myself, the}
\stick{Bastile is but another word for a}
\stick{tower\tskk and a tower is but another}
\stick{word for a house you can’t get out of}
\stick{\tskk Mercy on the gouty!  for they are}
\stick{in it twice a year\tskk But with nine}
\stick{livres a day, and pen and ink and}
\stick{paper and patience, albeit a man can’t}
\stick{get out, he may do very well within}
\stck{\tskk at least for a month or six weeks; at}
\stick{the end of which, if he is a harmless}
\stick{fellow his innocence appears, and}
\stick{he comes out a better and wiser man}
than he went in.

I had some occasion (I forget what)\break
\stick{to step into the court-yard, as I settled}
\catch{this}
\stick{this account; and remember I walk’d}
\stick{down stairs in no small triumph with}
\stick{the conceit of my reasoning.\tskk Be-}
\stck{shrew the \i{sombre} pencil! said I vaunt-}
\stick{ingly\tskk for I envy not its powers,}
\stick{which paints the evils of life with so}
\stick{hard and deadly a colouring.  The}
\stick{mind sits terrified at the objects she}
\stck{has magnified herself, and blackened:}
\stick{reduce them to their proper size and}
\stick{hue she overlooks them\tskk ’Tis true,}
\stick{said I, correcting the proposition\tskk}
\stick{the Bastile is not an evil to be de-}

\stk{up the fossè\tskk unbarricade the doors\tskk}

\stick{and not of a man which holds you in}
\catchs{C 4}{it\tskk}
\stick{it\tskk the evil vanishes, and you bear}
the other half without complaint.

I was interrupted in the hey-day\break
\stick{of this soliloquy, with a voice which}
\stick{I took to be of a child, which com-}
\stick{plained \lqq it could not get out.\rqq \tskk I}
\stick{look’d up and down the passage, and}
\stick{seeing neither man, woman, or child,}
I went out without farther attention.

In my return back through the\break
\stick{passage, I heard the same words re-}
\stick{peated twice over; and looking up,}
\stick{I saw it was a starling hung in a little}
\stick{cage.\tskk \lqq I can’t get out\tskk I can’t get}
\lqq out,\rqq\ said the starling.

\patch[\baselineskip]{I stood}

I stood looking at the bird: and\break
\stck{to every person who came through the}
\stick{passage it ran fluttering to the side to-}
\stick{wards which they approach’d it, with}
\stk{the same lamentation of its captivity\tskk}
\stick{\lqq I can’t get out\rqq, said the starling\tskk}
\stick{God help thee! said I, but I’ll let}
\stick{thee out, cost what it will; so I turn’d}

\stck{was twisted and double twisted so fast}
\stick{with wire, there was no getting it}
\stick{open without pulling the cage to}
pieces\tskk I took both hands to it.

The bird flew to the place where\break

\stick{said the starling\tskk \lqq I can’t get out}
\stick{\lqq\tskk I can’t get out,\rqq\ said the star-}
ling.

I vow, I never had my affections\break
\stick{more tenderly awakened; or do I re-}

\stick{the dissipated spirits, to which my}
\stick{reason had been a bubble, were so}

\dropcap{T}{he} bird in his cage pursued\break
me into my room; I sat down\break
\stick{close to my table, and leaning my}
\stick{head upon my hand, I began to}
\stick{figure to myself the miseries of con-}
\stick{finement.  I was in a right frame}
\stick{for it, and so I gave full scope to my}
imagination.

I was going to begin with the\break
\stick{millions of my fellow creatures born}
\stick{to no inheritance but slavery; but}
\stick{finding, however affecting the pic-}
\stick{ture was, that I could not bring it}
\catch{near}
\stick{near me, and that the multitude of}
\stick{of\sic sad groups in it did but distract}
me.\tskk

\tskk I took a single captive, and hav-\break
\stick{ing first shut him up in his dungeon,}
\stick{I then look’d through the twilight of}
his grated door to take his picture.

I beheld his body half wasted away\break
\stick{with long expectation and confine-}

\stick{moon in all that time\tskk nor had the}
\catch{voice}
\stick{voice of friend or kinsman breathed}
through his lattice\tskk his children\tskk

\tsk But here my heart began to bleed\break
\stick{\tskk and I was forced to go on with}
another part of the portrait.

He was sitting upon the ground\break
\stick{upon a little straw, in the furthest}
\stick{corner of his dungeon, which was}
\stick{alternately his chair and bed: a little}
\stck{calendar of small sticks were laid at the}
\stick{head notch’d all over with the dismal}
\stck{days and nights he had pass’d there\tskk}
\stick{he had one of these little sticks in his}
\stick{hand, and with a rusty nail he was}
\stick{etching another day of misery to add}
\stick{to the heap.  As I darkened the little}
\stick{light he had, he lifted up a hopeless}
\catch{eye}
\stick{eye towards the door, then cast it}
\stick{down\tskk shook his head, and went on}
\stick{with his work of affliction.  I heard}
\stick{his chains upon his legs, as he turn’d}
\stick{his body to lay his little stick upon the}
\stck{bundle\tskk He gave a deep sigh\tskk I saw}
\stick{the iron enter into his soul\tskk I burst}
\stick{into tears\tskk I could not sustain the}
\stick{picture of confinement which my}
\stick{fancy had drawn\tskk I started up from}
\stick{my chair, and calling La Fleur, I bid}
\stick{him bespeak me a \i{remise}, and have}

\stick{look’d towards the stairs, as if he}

\stick{pose the town is not very large, said}
\stick{I.\tskk The coachman begg’d pardon for}
\stick{setting me right, and told me it was}
\stick{very superb, and that numbers of the}
\stick{first dukes and marquises and counts}
\stick{had hotels\tskk The Count de B\anon, of}
\catch{whom}
\stick{whom the bookseller at the Quai de}
\stick{Conti had spoke so handsomely the}
\stick{night before, came instantly into my}
\stick{mind.\tskk And why should I not go,}
\stick{thought I, to the Count de B\anon,}
\stick{who has so high an idea of English}
\stick{books and Englishmen\tskk and tell}
\stick{him my story?\@ so I changed my}
\stick{mind a second time\tskk In truth it was}
\stick{the third; for I had intended that day}
\stick{for Madame de R\anon\ in the Rue}
\stick{St.\@ Pierre, and had devoutly sent her}
\stick{word by her \i{fille de chambre} that I}
\stick{would assuredly wait upon her\tskk but}
\stick{I am govern’d by circumstances\tskk I}
\stick{cannot govern them: so seeing a man}
\stick{standing with a basket on the other}
\stick{side of the street, as if he had some-}
\stick{thing to sell, I bid La Fleur go up}
\catch{to}
\stick{to him, and enquire for the Count’s}
hotel.

La Fleur return’d a little pale; and\break
\stick{told me it was a Chevalier de St.}
\stick{Louis selling \i{patès}\tskk It is impossible,}
\stick{La Fleur!\@ said I.\tskk La Fleur could no}
\stick{more account for the phenomenon}
\stick{than myself; but persisted in his}
\stick{story: he had seen the croix set in}
\stick{gold, with its red ribband, he said, tied}
\stick{to his button-hole\tskk and had look’d}
\stick{into the basket and seen the \i{patès}}
\stick{which the Chevalier was selling; so}
could not be mistaken in that.

Such a reverse in man’s life awakens\break
\stick{a better principle than curiosity: I}
\stick{could not help looking for some time}
\catch{at}
\stick{at him as I sat in the \i{remise}\tskk the}
\stick{more I look’d at him\tsk his croix and}
\stick{his basket, the stronger they wove}
\stick{themselves into my brain\tskk I got out}
of the \i{remise} and went towards him.

He was begirt with a clean linen\break
\stick{apron which fell below his knees, and}
\stick{with a sort of a bib that went half way}
\stick{up his breast; upon the top of this,}
\stick{but a little below the hem, hung his}
\stick{croix.  His basket of little \i{patès} was}
\stick{cover’d over with a white damask}
\stick{napkin; another of the same kind}
\stick{was spread at the bottom; and there}
\stick{was a look of \i{propreté} and neatness}
\stick{throughout; that one might have}
\stick{bought his \i{patès} of him, as much}
from appetite as sentiment.

\patchv{E}{He}

He made an offer of them to nei-\break
\stick{ther; but stood still with them at the}
\stick{corner of a hotel, for those to buy}
who chose it, without solicitation.

He was about forty-eight\tskk of a\break
\stick{sedate look, something approaching}
\stick{to gravity.  I did not wonder.\tskk I}
\stick{went up rather to the basket than}
\stick{him, and having lifted up the nap-}
\stick{kin, and taking one of his \i{patès} into}
\stick{my hand\tskk I begg’d he would explain}
the appearance which affected me.

He told me in a few words, that\break
\stick{the best part of his life had pass’d in}
\stick{the service, in which, after spending}
\stick{a small patrimony, he had obtain’d}
\stick{a company and the croix with it;}
\catch{but}
\stick{but that, at the conclusion of the last}
\stick{peace, his regiment being reformed,}
\stick{and the whole corps, with those of}
\stick{some other regiments, left without any}
\stick{provision\tskk he found himself in a}
\stick{wide world without friends, without}
\stick{a livre\tskk and indeed, said he, with-}
\stick{out any thing but this\tskk (pointing, as}
\stick{he said it, to his croix)\tskk The poor}
\stick{chevalier won my pity, and he finish’d}
\stick{the scene with winning my esteem}
too.

The king, he said, was the most\break
\stick{generous of princes, but his gene-}
\stick{rosity could neither relieve nor reward}
\stick{every one, and it was only his mis-}
\stick{fortune to be amongst the number.}
\stick{He had a little wife, he said, whom}
\catchs{E 2}{he}
\stick{he loved, who did the \i{patisserie}; and}
\stick{added, he felt no dishonour in defend-}
\stick{ing her and himself from want in this}
\stick{way\tskk unless Providence had offer’d}
him a better.

It would be wicked to with-hold a\break
\stick{pleasure from the good, in passing}
\stick{over what happen’d to this poor}
\stick{Chevalier of St.\@ Louis about nine}
months after.

It seems he usually took his stand\break
\stick{near the iron gates which lead up to}
\stick{the palace, and as his croix had}
\stick{caught the eyes of numbers, num-}
\stick{bers had made the same enquiry}
\stick{which I had done\tskk He had told}
\stick{them the same story, and always with}
\catch{so}
\stick{so much modesty and good sense,}
\stick{that it had reach’d at last the king’s}
\stick{ears\tskk who, hearing the Chevalier}
\stick{had been a gallant officer, and re-}
\stick{spected by the whole regiment as a}
\stick{man of honour and integrity\tskk he}
\stick{broke up his little trade by a pension}
of fifteen hundred livres a year.

As I have told this to please the\break
\stick{reader, I beg he will allow me to}
\stick{relate another out of its order, to}
\stick{please myself\tskk the two stories reflect}
\stick{light upon each other,\tskk and ’tis a pity}

I have something within me which\break

\stick{of chit-chat I have often endeavoured}

Excuse me, Monsieur Le Count,\break
\stick{said I\tskk as for the nakedness of your}
\stick{land, if I saw it, I should cast my}
\stick{eyes over it with tears in them\tskk and}
\stick{for that of your women (blushing at}
\stick{the idea he had excited in me) I am}
\stick{so evangelical in this, and have such}
\stick{a fellow-feeling for what ever is \i{weak}}
\stick{about them, that I would cover it}
\stick{with a garment, if I knew how to}
\stick{throw it on\tskk But I could wish, con-}

\stick{their hearts, and through the different}
\stick{disguises of customs, climates, and}

It is for this reason, Monsieur le\break
\stick{Compte, continued I, that I have}
\stick{not seen the Palais royal\tskk nor the}
\stick{Luxembourg\tskk nor the Façade of}
\stick{the Louvre\tskk nor have attempted to}

\stick{ceive every fair being as a temple,}
\stick{and would rather enter in, and see the}
\stick{original drawings and loose sketches}
\stick{hung up in it, than the transfigura-}
tion of Raphael itself.

The thirst of this, continued I,\break
\stick{as impatient as that which inflames}
\stick{the breast of the connoisseur, has}
\stick{led me from my own home into}
\stick{France\tskk and from France will lead}

\stick{of the heart in pursuit of \s{Nature},}
\stick{and those affections which rise out of}
\stick{her, which make us love each other}
\tskk and the world, better than we do.

The Count said a great many civil\break
\stick{things to me upon the occasion; and}
\stick{added very politely how much he}
\stick{stood obliged to Shakespear for}
\stick{making me known to him\tskk but,}
\stick{\i{a-propos}, said he\tskk Shakespear is full}

The reader may suppose that after\break

\stick{against it\tskk he insisted I had a reserve,}
\stick{and that I would speak my opinion}

I believe, Mons.\@ Le Compte, said\break

all kind of reasoning upon him.

It was a tall figure of a philoso-\break

\stick{pass’d and repass’d sedately along the}
\stick{street, making a turn of about sixty}
\stick{paces on each side of the gate of the}

\stick{seem’d to have seen some years ser-}

\stick{was a little air of frugal \i{propretè}}
\stick{throughout him.  By his pulling off}
\stick{his hat, and his attitude of accosting}
\stick{a good many in his way, I saw he}
\stick{was asking charity; so I got a sous or}
\catch{two}
\stick{two out of my pocket ready to give}
\stick{him, as he took me in his turn\tskk he}
\stick{pass’d by me without asking any}
\stick{thing\tskk and yet did not go five steps}

\stick{who was coming the same way.\tskk An}
\stick{ancient gentleman came slowly\tskk and,}
\stick{after him, a young smart one\tskk He}
\stick{let them both pass, and ask’d nothing:}
\stick{I stood observing him half an hour, in}
\stick{which time he had made a dozen}
\stick{turns backwards and forwards, and}
\stick{found that he invariably pursued the}
same plan.

\patch[\baselineskip]{There}

There were two things very sin-\break

\stick{was, why the man should \i{only} tell}
\stick{his story to the sex\tskk and secondly\tskk}
\stick{what kind of story it was, and what}
\stick{species of eloquence it could be,}
\stick{which soften’d the hearts of the}
\stick{women, which he knew ’twas to no}
purpose to practise upon the men.

There were two other circum-\break
\stick{stances which entangled this mystery}
\stick{\tskk the one was, he told every woman}
\stick{what he had to say in her ear, and in}
\stick{a way which had much more the air}
\stick{of a secret than a petition\tskk the}
\stick{other was, it was always successful}
\stick{\tskk he never stopp’d a woman, but she}
\catch{pull’d}
\stick{pull’d out her purse, and immedi-}
ately gave him something.

I could form no system to explain\break
the phenomenon.

I had got a riddle to amuse me for\break

up stairs to my chamber.

\stick{and you may tell him, if you will,}
\stick{La Fleur, added I, that if the young}

This was a sacrifice not to him,\break
\stick{but myself, having resolved, after so}
\stick{narrow an escape, to run no more}
\stick{risks, but to leave Paris, if it was}
\stick{possible, with all the virtue I enter’d}
in.

\i{C’est deroger à noblesse}, \i{Monsieur},\break

\stick{upon his lips to say to me, or ask}
\stick{me, which he could not get off: I}

\stick{\tskk I would have given any thing to}

\stick{rather showy than otherwise\tskk and as}
\stick{the blue was not violent, it suited}
\stick{with the coat and breeches very well:}
\stick{he had squeez’d out of the money,}
\stick{moreover, a new bag and a solitaire;}

A low voice, with a good turn of\break

\stick{open’d her mouth\tskk She had lost her}
\stick{husband; he had died, she said, of}
\stick{anguish, for the loss of Maria’s senses}
\stick{about a month before.\tskk She had}
\stick{feared at first, she added, that it}
\stick{would have plunder’d her poor girl}
\catch{of}
\stick{of what little understanding was}
\stick{left\tskk but, on the contrary, it had}
\stick{brought her more to herself\tskk still she}
\stick{could not rest\tskk her poor daughter,}
\stick{she said, crying, was wandering some-}
where about the road\tskk

\tskk Why does my pulse beat languid\break
\stick{as I write this? and what made La}
\stick{Fleur, whose heart seem’d only to be}
\stick{tuned to joy, to pass the back of his}
\stick{hand twice across his eyes, as the}
\stick{woman stood and told it?  I beck-}
\stick{on’d to the postilion to turn back}
into the road.

When we had got within half a\break
\stick{league of Moulines, at a little opening}
\stick{in the road leading to a thicket, I}
\catch{discovered}
\stick{discovered poor Maria sitting under}
\stick{a poplar.  She was sitting with her}
\stick{elbow in her lap, and her head lean-}
\stick{ing on one side within her hand\tskk a}
\stick{small brook ran at the foot of the}
tree.

I bid the postilion go on with the\break
\stick{chaise to Moulines\tskk and La Fleur}
\stick{to bespeak my supper\tskk and that I}
would walk after him.

She was dress’d in white, and much\break
\stick{as my friend described her, except}
\stick{that her hair hung loose, which before}
\stick{was twisted within a silk net.\tskk She}
\stick{had, superadded likewise to her jacket,}
\stick{a pale green ribband which fell across}
\stick{her shoulder to the waist; at the end}
\catch{of}
\stick{of which hung her pipe.\tskk Her goat}
\stick{had been as faithless as her lover;}
\stick{and she had got a little dog in lieu}
\stick{of him, which she had kept tied by a}
\stick{string to her girdle; as I look’d at}
\stick{her dog, she drew him towards her}
\stick{with the string.\tskk \lqq Thou shalt not}
\stick{\lqq leave me, Sylvio,\rqq\ said she.  I look’d}
\stick{in Maria’s eyes, and saw she was}
\stick{thinking more of her father than of}
\stick{her lover or her little goat; for as she}
\stick{utter’d them the tears trickled down}
her cheeks.

I sat down close by her; and Ma-\break
\stick{ria let me wipe them away as they}
\stick{fell with my handkerchief.\tskk I then}
\stick{steep’d it in my own\tskk and then in}
\stick{hers\tskk and then in mine\tskk and then}
\catch{I wip’d}
\stick{I wip’d hers again\tskk and as I did}
\stick{it, I felt such undescribable emotions}
\stick{within me, as I am sure could not}
\stick{be accounted for from any combina-}
tions of matter and motion.

I am positive I have a soul; nor\break
\stick{can all the books with which mate-}
\stick{rialists have pester’d the world ever}
convince me to the contrary.

\dropcap{W}{hen} Maria had come a little\break
to herself, I ask’d her if she\break
\stick{remember’d a pale thin person of}
\stick{a man who had sat down betwixt her}
\stick{and her goat about two years before?}
\stick{She said, she was unsettled much at}
\stick{that time, but remember’d it upon}
\stick{two accounts\tskk that ill as she was she}
\stick{saw the person pitied her; and next,}
\stick{that her goat had stolen his handker-}
\stick{chief, and she had beat him for the}
\stick{theft\tskk she had wash’d it, she said, in}
\stick{the brook, and kept it ever since in}
\stick{her pocket to restore it to him in case}
\stick{she should ever see him again, which,}
\catch{she}
\stick{she added, he had half promised her.}
\stick{As she told me this, she took the hand-}
\stick{kerchief out of her pocket to let me}
\stick{see it; she had folded it up neatly in}
\stick{a couple of vine leaves, tied round}
\stick{with a tendril\tskk on opening it, I saw}
an S mark’d in one of the corners.

She had since that, she told\break
\stick{me, stray’d as far as Rome, and}
\stick{walk’d round St Peter’s once\tskk and}
\stick{return’d back\tskk that she found her}

Shorn indeed! and to the quick,\break

Nature melted within me, as I\break

to go on.

\patch{He}

He had not mounted half a mile\break
\stick{higher, when coming to a flinty}
\stick{piece of road, the poor devil lost a}
\stick{second shoe, and from off his other}
\stick{fore-foot.  I then got out of the}
\stick{chaise in good earnest; and seeing}
\stick{a house about a quarter of a mile to}
\stick{the left-hand, with a great deal to do}
\stick{I prevailed upon the postilion to}
\stick{turn up to it.  The look of the house,}
\stick{and of every thing about it, as we}
\stick{drew nearer, soon reconciled me}
\stick{to the disaster.\tskk It was a little}
\stick{farm-house, surrounded with about}
\stick{twenty acres of vineyard, about as}
\stick{much corn\tskk and close to the house,}
\stick{on one side, was a \i{potagerie} of an}

\catch{which}
\stick{which could make plenty in a French}
\stick{peasant’s house\tskk and on the other}

\stick{wherewithal to dress it.  It was about}
\stick{eight in the evening when I got to the}
\stick{house\tskk so I left the postilion to ma-}
\stick{nage his point as he could\tskk and for}
\stick{mine, I walk’d directly into the}
house.

The family consisted of an old\break
\stick{grey-headed man and his wife, with}
\stick{five or six sons and sons-in-law and}
\stick{their several wives, and a joyous ge-}

\stick{table; and a flaggon of wine at each}

\stick{stages of the repast\tskk ’twas a feast of}
love.

The old man rose up to meet me,\break

\head{32pt}{48}{THE GRACE}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{W}{hen} supper was over, the old
man gave a knock upon the table with the
haft of his knife, to bid them prepare for
the dance: the moment the signal was
given, the women and girls ran altogether
into a back apartment to tie up their
hair\tskk and the young men to the door
to wash their faces, and change their
sabots; and in three minutes every soul
was ready upon a little esplanade before
the house to begin.\tskk The old man and
his wife came out last, and placing me
betwixt them, sat down upon a sofa of turf
by the door.

The old man had some fifty years ago been
no mean performer upon the
\i{vielle}\tskk and at the age he was
then of, touch’d it well enough for the
purpose.  His wife sung now and then a
little to the tune\tskk then
intermitted\tskk and join’d her old man
again, as their children and
grand-children danced before them.

It was not till the middle of the second
dance, when, from some pauses in the
movements, wherein they all seemed to look
up, I fancied I could distinguish an
elevation of spirit different from that
which is the cause or the effect of simple
jollity.  In a word, I thought I beheld
\i{Religion} mixing in the dance\tskk
but, as I had never seen her so engaged, I
should have look’d upon it now as one of
the illusions of an imagination which is
eternally misleading me, had not the old
man, as soon as the dance ended, said,
that this was their constant way; and that
all his life long he had made it a rule,
after supper was over, to call out his
family to dance and rejoice; believing, he
said, that a cheerful and contented mind
was the best sort of thanks to heaven that
an illiterate peasant could pay\tskk 

Or a learned prelate either, said I.




\head{32pt}{48}{THE CASE OF DELICACY}

\vskip 6pt


\dropcap{W}{hen} you have gained the top
of Mount Taurira, you run presently down
to Lyons\tskk adieu, then, to all rapid
movements!  ’Tis a journey of caution; and
it fares better with sentiments, not to be
in a hurry with them; so I contracted with
a \i{voiturin} to take his time with a
couple of mules, and convoy me in my own
chaise safe to Turin, through Savoy.

Poor, patient, quiet, honest people! fear
not: your poverty, the treasury of your
simple virtues, will not be envied you by
the world, nor will your valleys be
invaded by it.\tskk Nature! in the midst
of thy disorders, thou art still friendly
to the scantiness thou hast created: with
all thy great works about thee, little
hast thou left to give, either to the
scythe or to the sickle\tskk but to that
little thou grantest safety and
protection; and sweet are the dwellings
which stand so shelter’d.

Let the way-worn traveller vent his
complaints upon the sudden turns and
dangers of your roads\tskk your
rocks\tskk your precipices;\tskk the
difficulties of getting up\tskk the
horrors of getting down\tskk mountains
impracticable\tskk and cataracts, which
roll down great stones from their summits,
and block his road up.\tskk The peasants
had been all day at work in removing a
fragment of this kind between St. Michael
and Madane; and, by the time my
\i{voiturin} got to the place, it wanted
full two hours of completing before a
passage could any how be gain’d: there was
nothing but to wait with patience\tskk
’twas a wet and tempestuous night; so that
by the delay, and that together, the
\i{voiturin} found himself obliged to put
up five miles short of his stage at a
little decent kind of an inn by the
roadside.

I forthwith took possession of my
bedchamber\tskk got a good fire\tskk
order’d supper; and was thanking heaven it
was no worse, when a \i{voiturin} arrived
with a lady in it and her servant maid.

As there was no other bed-chamber in the
house, the hostess\tskk without much
nicety, led them into mine, telling them,
as she usher’d them in, that there was
nobody in it but an English
gentleman\tskk that there were two good
beds in it, and a closet within the room
which held another.  The accent in which
she spoke of this third bed, did not say
much for it\tskk however, she said there
were three beds and but three people, and
she durst say, the gentleman would do
anything to accommodate matters.\tskk I
left not the lady a moment to make a
conjecture about it\tskk so instantly made
a declaration that I would do anything in
my power.

As this did not amount to an absolute
surrender of my bed-chamber, I still felt
myself so much the proprietor, as to have
a right to do the honours of it\tskk so I
desired the lady to sit down\tskk pressed
her into the warmest seat\tskk called for
more wood\tskk desired the hostess to
enlarge the plan of the supper, and to
favour us with the very best wine.

The lady had scarce warm’d herself five
minutes at the fire, before she began to
turn her head back, and give a look at the
beds; and the oftener she cast her eyes
that way, the more they return’d
perplexd\tskk I felt for her\tskk and for
myself: for in a few minutes, what by her
looks, and the case itself, I found myself
as much embarrassed as it was possible the
lady could be herself.

That the beds we were to lie in were in
one and the same room, was enough simply
by itself to have excited all this\tskk
but the position of them, for they stood
parallel, and so very close to each other
as only to allow space for a small wicker
chair betwixt them, rendered the affair
still more oppressive to us\tskk they
were fixed up moreover near the fire; and
the projection of the chimney on one side,
and a large beam which cross’d the room on
the other, formed a kind of recess for
them that was no way favourable to the
nicety of our sensations\tskk if anything
could have added to it, it was that the
two beds were both of them so very small,
as to cut us off from every idea of the
lady and the maid lying together; which in
either of them, could it have been
feasible, my lying beside them, though a
thing not to be wish’d, yet there was
nothing in it so terrible which the
imagination might not have pass’d over
without torment.

As for the little room within, it offer’d
little or no consolation to us: ’twas a
damp, cold closet, with a half dismantled
window-shutter, and with a window which
had neither glass nor oil paper in it to
keep out the tempest of the night.  I did
not endeavour to stifle my cough when the
lady gave a peep into it; so it reduced
the case in course to this
alternative\tskk That the lady should
sacrifice her health to her feelings, and
take up with the closet herself, and
abandon the bed next mine to her
maid\tskk or that the girl should take
the closet, \&c., \&c.

The lady was a Piedmontese of about
thirty, with a glow of health in her
cheeks.  The maid was a Lyonoise of
twenty, and as brisk and lively a French
girl as ever moved.\tskk There were
difficulties every way\tskk and the
obstacle of the stone in the road, which
brought us into the distress, great as it
appeared whilst the peasants were removing
it, was but a pebble to what lay in our
ways now.\tskk I have only to add, that it
did not lessen the weight which hung upon
our spirits, that we were both too
delicate to communicate what we felt to
each other upon the occasion.

We sat down to supper; and had we not had
more generous wine to it than a little inn
in Savoy could have furnish’d, our tongues
had been tied up, till necessity herself
had set them at liberty\tskk but the lady
having a few bottles of Burgundy in her
voiture, sent down her \i{fille de
chambre} for a couple of them; so that by
the time supper was over, and we were left
alone, we felt ourselves inspired with a
strength of mind sufficient to talk, at
least, without reserve upon our situation.
We turn’d it every way, and debated and
considered it in all kinds of lights in
the course of a two hours’ negotiation; at
the end of which the articles were settled
finally betwixt us, and stipulated for in
form and manner of a treaty of peace\tskk
and I believe with as much religion and
good faith on both sides as in any treaty
which has yet had the honour of being
handed down to posterity.

They were as follow\tskk 

First, as the right of the bed-chamber is
in Monsieur\tskk and he thinking the bed
next to the fire to be the warmest, he
insists upon the concession on the lady’s
side of taking up with it.

Granted, on the part of Madame; with a
proviso, That as the curtains of that bed
are of a flimsy transparent cotton, and
appear likewise too scanty to draw close,
that the Fille de Chambre shall fasten
up the opening, either by corking pins, or
needle and thread, in such manner as shall
be deem’d a sufficient barrier on the side
of Monsieur.

2dly.  It is required on the part of
Madame, that Monsieur shall lie the whole
night through in his \i{robe de chambre}.

Rejected: inasmuch as Monsieur is not
worth a \i{robe de chambre}; he having
nothing in his portmanteau but six shirts
and a black silk pair of breeches.

The mentioning the silk pair of breeches
made an intire change of the article\tskk
for the breeches were accepted as an
equivalent for the \i{robe de chambre};
and so it was stipulated and agreed upon,
that I should lie in my black silk
breeches all night.

3dly.  It was insisted upon and stipulated
for by the lady, that after Monsieur was
got to bed, and the candle and fire
extinguished, that Monsieur should not
speak one single word the whole night.

Granted; provided Monsieur’s saying his
prayers might not be deemed an infraction
of the treaty.

There was but one point forgot in this
treaty, and that was the manner in which
the lady and myself should be obliged to
undress and get to bed\tskk there was but
one way of doing it, and that I leave to
the reader to devise; protesting as I do
it, that if it is not the most delicate in
nature, ’tis the fault of his own
imagination\tskk against which this is
not my first complaint.

Now, when we were got to bed, whether it
was the novelty of the situation, or what
it was, I know not; but so it was, I could
not shut my eyes; I tried this side, and
that, and turn’d and turn’d again, till a
full hour after midnight; when Nature and
patience both wearing out\tskk O, my God!
said I.

\tskk You have broke the treaty, Monsieur,
said the lady, who had no more slept than
myself.\tskk I begg’d a thousand
pardons\tskk but insisted it was no more
than an ejaculation.  She maintained ’twas
an intire infraction of the treaty\tskk I
maintain’d it was provided for in the
clause of the third article.

The lady would by no means give up her
point, though she weaken’d her barrier by
it; for in the warmth of the dispute, I
could hear two or three corking pins fall
out of the curtain to the ground.

Upon my word and honour, Madame, said
I\tskk stretching my arm out of bed by
way of asseveration.\tskk 

(I was going to have added, that I would
not have trespassed against the remotest
idea of decorum for the world)\tskk 

But the Fille de Chambre hearing there
were words between us, and fearing that
hostilities would ensue in course, had
crept silently out of her closet, and it
being totally dark, had stolen so close to
our beds, that she had got herself into
the narrow passage which separated them,
and had advanced so far up as to be in a
line betwixt her mistress and me\tskk 

So that when I stretch’d out my
hand, I caught hold of the Fille de
Chambre’s
