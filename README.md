# tex-tristram

This project is an attempt to produce an accurate and useable unannotated
text of Laurence Sterne's "Tristram Shandy" for general reading or study.

Part of the joy of the original work is that each of the nine volumes is a
work of art in itself, and that the pagination, the decorations, and even in
some cases the hyphenation of the lines are all meaningful.  

This project therefore presents the text in nine separate PDF files,
designed to be read in a PDF viewer that allows you to see two pages at
once, like an open book.  Each page break faithfully follows the page breaks
in the originals, and the text includes all the dashes, asterisks, blanks, and
catch-words.

The spelling and punctuation is all Sterne's (as far as human proof-reading
can be sure), but the medial long-s characters are replaced with modern
ones.  The font used is Linux Libertine, with historical swash ligatures
for ct and st.

The text is derived from the Project Gutenberg source for Sterne's work,
carefully corrected by hand using scanned copies of the real first edition
volumes.  The text is marked up with LaTeX and compiled into PDFs using the
`lualatex` engine.
